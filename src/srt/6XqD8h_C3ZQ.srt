1
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,070

alright so I didn't get picked for a

2
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,380
track a slot so I brought a node talk to

3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,840
a track be slot for jay is calm even

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,220
though node comp is like what two days

5
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,960
from now three days from now but

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,489
whatever this is cool stuff I promise so

7
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:36,019
my proposed talk for jay is confident

8
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:39,320
got rejected was whatever cool thing i'm

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,570
working on at the time and i guess that

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,269
was too vague I don't know and so

11
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:45,739
something I've been playing with my last

12
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:50,199
on a week is making desktop apps in node

13
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,670
who thinks it would be really cool to

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,500
make native desktop apps in JavaScript

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:06,359
yeah but what do you use for you I HTML

16
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:10,850
gtk cute I don't know well when I use

17
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,330
all of them so let's talk about the

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,250
progression of JavaScript you know when

19
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,110
javascript was first made and Brendan

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,950
Eich was an intern it was to add some

21
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,390
sutter was the internal point I remember

22
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,369
sorry when Brendan Eich was invented the

23
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,500
language it was for adding interactivity

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,329
to web pages so they could compete with

25
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,310
there and explore and so we have like

26
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,430
mouse over image swaps form validation

27
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,479
eventually this awesome thing called d

28
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,180
HTML came out I even started my own

29
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,430
company like back in two thousand making

30
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,090
d HTML games clearly that company died

31
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,710
but if you go to Wayback Machine and go

32
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,090
to my website you can see a quote in

33
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,520
there where I said the future is HTML

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,280
CSS and JavaScript and that was 10 11

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,549
years ago so that's pretty good right

36
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,750
and then we had the ads all JavaScript

37
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,759
powered adds a pop up over your content

38
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,409
or you hover over link accidently and

39
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:06,110
it's an ad crazy stuff and then we have

40
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,850
Ajax we're like hey we don't need to

41
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,039
make round trips and so we started

42
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,049
making actual applications in the web

43
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,780
HTML was not made for applications HTML

44
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,480
was made for linkable documents and it

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,480
shows in CSS one and two vertical and

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,530
horizontal treated very differently

47
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,109
because you're constrained a window

48
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,400
which you flow vertically and so they

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,470
act weird an application you kind of

50
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,030
treat them symmetrically so it doesn't

51
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,130
work well

52
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,990
so we've we've worked around that we got

53
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,900
css3 now which helps a ton and then

54
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,690
WebSockets came out and we can do really

55
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,310
low latency like games and you have

56
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,430
WebGL and JavaScript on the front end is

57
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,290
a really really powerful platform that's

58
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,200
why this conference is so awesome and

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,990
then a year or two ago server-side

60
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,250
JavaScript start taking off and as a lot

61
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,450
of you probably now work a lot on node

62
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,270
and then I don't know what's after that

63
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,220
but something that I've been working on

64
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,290
is mating making actual native apps

65
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,630
written in JavaScript and so I'm just

66
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,830
going to show you guys a few the things

67
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,180
I've been experimenting with hopefully

68
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,470
do some live coding that hopefully

69
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,930
doesn't crash my laptop and she'll run

70
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,209
out of time at that point so oh I should

71
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,420
have been doing this all right so first

72
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,900
I used to do gtk programming I admit it

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,030
it's it's kind of a cool platform the

74
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,500
object model is kind of weird but I did

75
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,989
it from Python so it's okay i don't have

76
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,360
deal with the sea so Tim smart not me

77
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,930
made static bindings to gtk and it's on

78
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,299
github you can look at it and with that

79
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,430
you can go here let me go to that right

80
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:50,030
now i just downloaded it and i believe

81
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,530
it's an MPN so let's go to test that is

82
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,290
not big enough is it no how about how

83
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,959
about that is that good more I'll need

84
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,750
some room I'll try one more how's that

85
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:09,870
monster-sized so

86
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,950
so if you've done gtk before this should

87
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,060
look familiar so we got H boxes windows

88
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,400
in trees which is a text field we've got

89
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,040
progress bars and he's going to add some

90
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,540
stuff to these and render it to the

91
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,080
screen so this is basically gtk c code

92
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,300
but written in JavaScript and this is a

93
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,870
node program so you can do node kitchen

94
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,050
sink jas and there there's a native app

95
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,660
it looks weird but if we do this crazy

96
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,210
window manager there you go so you got a

97
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,490
button and you click it and the

98
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,450
callbacks can see it says I heart gtk

99
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,750
it's got a text field change events so

100
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,760
that's kind of cool right this is an

101
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,000
HTML this is what it is JavaScript

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,680
really neat right but it's static

103
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,990
bindings which is good and bad so it's

104
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,420
very fast but it has to be bound

105
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,310
manually so you either have to write a

106
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,930
whole lot of code or start noticing

107
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,220
patterns and generate a whole lot of

108
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,380
code but either way it's a lot of work I

109
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,420
mean the Python guys been doing it for

110
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,810
years but it's still a lot of work so

111
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,660
numb three has this cool thing that

112
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,390
they've released now called gir G object

113
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,840
introspection repository I believe and

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,920
basically what it is is all the source

115
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,560
code is forced to have annotations

116
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,640
saying this is the type and this is a

117
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,110
return value and all this cool stuff and

118
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,820
then this other program comes in after

119
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,470
the fact and takes that source code and

120
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,510
creates this massive XML files and then

121
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,040
another program takes those XML files

122
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,490
and generates these type lib files but

123
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,530
all that's done for you and then there's

124
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,020
this library called GI repository and

125
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,100
what it'll do is it'll take these type

126
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,250
lib files and use an FFI you can call

127
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,050
anything in the node ecosystem and you

128
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,470
only have to bind to no gir this isn't

129
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,970
done yet if you go to my repo there it's

130
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,830
pretty much just to read me so I'm

131
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,690
looking for help on this but I think it

132
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,310
would be really cool if node had first

133
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,660
class bindings for this there's already

134
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,880
two JavaScript bindings one is using

135
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,290
spider monkey and one is using

136
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,170
javascript port from web kit and the

137
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,580
spider monkey one is actually what runs

138
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,969
the window manager in gnome shell

139
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:22,699
and gnome 3 so the new Nome actually has

140
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,119
a JavaScript powered window manager and

141
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:29,360
I think that's really cool so while I

142
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,779
don't have a working gnome one yet a

143
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:36,079
note node one yet what did I call that

144
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:42,379
thing so I work at palms so my sample

145
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,709
app is always that mythical IDE so this

146
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:48,229
is a seed jsf i implement on require so

147
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,389
it looks more like a note app but you

148
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,429
you import gtk make a window this looks

149
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,019
a lot like the other one but this is all

150
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,549
dynamic there's no static bindings to

151
00:06:55,549 --> 00:07:00,610
gtk anywhere and then that's not node I

152
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,509
run that and hopefully this works so

153
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,319
this is so I've got tabs I've got a gtk

154
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,259
source for you here text editor I've got

155
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:14,239
a tree view over here it's not fully

156
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,919
implemented but as you say it it's a

157
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,599
desktop app I could maybe finish this

158
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,939
out and make an IDE that's optimized for

159
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,759
my mobile system at work and it'd all be

160
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:29,279
JavaScript which would be really cool

161
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:32,659
now the problem with all of this is I

162
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,939
was working on this for the demo and I

163
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:38,809
got stuck for about a day because my

164
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:40,729
notebook which is the tab view in gtk

165
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:43,399
wasn't displaying and I don't even know

166
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,659
why maybe I had the wrong version

167
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,029
compiled I was getting segfaults all the

168
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:50,509
time and I just couldn't see it i said i

169
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,949
wish i had WebKit devtools you guys have

170
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,919
heard about that right because if

171
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,029
something doesn't show there you just

172
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:01,429
inspect it look at the CSS oh it's got a

173
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:02,569
width of zero that's why it's invisible

174
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,849
now in gtk it's all opaque if someone

175
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,079
knows a way to inspect that that'd be

176
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,639
great as far as i know it doesn't exist

177
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,759
and well it's really fast and it's cool

178
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,929
you get access to all the built-in

179
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:14,119
native stuff it's also very painful for

180
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,209
a web developer so I started another

181
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:19,189
project and this is actually my first

182
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:22,009
node extension written and see I'm not a

183
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,379
Sikh odor but it's not too much and

184
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,349
right now it just binds to WebKit gtk so

185
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:29,599
it only runs in Linux but basically a

186
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,209
node process pops up a window that's a

187
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:33,180
webview

188
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,390
and talks to it right now it talks to it

189
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,460
over websockets but hopefully I want to

190
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,479
have better integration where you can

191
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,279
even share context and pass references

192
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,330
around but basically you can make html5

193
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,940
css3 and JavaScript apps that run as

194
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,850
desktop apps kind of like you guys have

195
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,110
heard of titanium and there's these

196
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,480
other ones there's the single what I got

197
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,760
single site browsers and there's a lot

198
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,149
of things to this but I work on node a

199
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:01,950
lot so I want this anode i want i want

200
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,420
WebKit bindings for note i think that

201
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:12,899
would be really cool and so what are you

202
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,339
going to use for a GUI tool kit when

203
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,630
you're making a desktop app you can use

204
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,940
whatever you want I work at Palm so i'm

205
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,500
going to use n yo there's going to be

206
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,870
talk about that later and i'm making a

207
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,820
text editor so i use the ace component

208
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,649
that the Ajax or guys made and it's a

209
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,220
really good editor so start up the snow

210
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,930
tap and this is a WebKit window and this

211
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,550
is looking at my hard drive node is

212
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,990
doing all the file access that's talking

213
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,520
number web sockets to the WebKit so

214
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,830
let's go met it and look at my own code

215
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:50,400
so nu AI de at j s so there's that is

216
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,790
that big enough i hope so i pull in a

217
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,050
whole bunch so this is the node server

218
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,540
that runs the backend and top cute is

219
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,020
the library i wrote and so you give top

220
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,560
cube an HTTP response handler and it

221
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,839
spawns a private HTTP server responds

222
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,220
the WebKit connects the two together and

223
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,750
you're good to go it pops up a window

224
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,430
and i'm using socket i/o for my

225
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,930
communication so it's basically just

226
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,529
bi-directional RPC so here's the read

227
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,329
dear command for reading this left

228
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:20,970
column whole bunch of ugly node code but

229
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,760
hey a sink is cool it's really fast and

230
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,260
then easier one to read a file I just

231
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,829
use the read file and then and that's it

232
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,360
that's the that's the node side so let's

233
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,610
go to the front end so there's a so

234
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,600
there's n yo socket i/o so here's my

235
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,589
index.html so I load n yo create the app

236
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:46,670
there will be a fuller demo of n you

237
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,310
later on but basically you got these

238
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,950
kinds would you like classes and so I

239
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,800
gotta flex box here with a file listing

240
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,450
in it and then flex there with a kind in

241
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,430
it they were flexes because the work

242
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,490
tool bars under them and there's just

243
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,260
some methods and so it's it's object

244
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,209
during a JavaScript and I don't know I

245
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,500
think this is really fun I like I like

246
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,970
writing JavaScript it's the language I

247
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,850
know well I do it for my job all day and

248
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,160
sometimes some of my task or rather you

249
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,490
know repetitive and like to when i'm

250
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,560
working on a mobile device I want to

251
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,810
edit source code on my desktop so that I

252
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,279
have version control but I have to push

253
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,839
it to the mobile device to test it and

254
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,459
sometimes I want to like run these

255
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:32,899
special commands to like clear the cache

256
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,580
or restart the app or just you know

257
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,399
utilities and it'd be really great if

258
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,050
there is a unified tool for this so I

259
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,029
tried to start writing one and I said I

260
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:42,890
really need a graphical interface for

261
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:48,830
this so this is my experiment and you

262
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,300
guys get a short 20 minute talk about

263
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,520
her 15 minute looks like so I'm looking

264
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,350
for help from the community I've talked

265
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,680
to a few people I'm get a show of hands

266
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,740
who would prefer native bindings to gtk

267
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,300
and whatever the desktop has and who

268
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,450
would prefer HTML so let's do native who

269
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,470
would love native bindings with

270
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,350
JavaScript a few clearly this is a bunch

271
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,550
of web developers who would like html5

272
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,060
all right well i'm working on both in my

273
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,459
free time this is nothing palm official

274
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,250
but hopefully these projects can take
