00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,930

okay hello there's an awful lot of you

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,820
out here

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,830
Wow it's very very cool to be here I was

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,910
at the 2014 event and I've done one more

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,949
since then so it's very nice to be here

6
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,929
but I'm very sad that this is is the

7
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,439
last of type I'm so pleased to be here

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,050
so I'm rich Landrieu it's becoming

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,060
increasingly difficult for me to tell

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,199
people what it is that I actually do I

11
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:41,879
kind of that they ask me so many things

12
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,680
for conference badges say can you put

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,930
your company down there and I think just

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,440
stop doing stuff on the web so amongst

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,539
that stuff I'm a CSS working group

16
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,660
member and I represent frontiers and its

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,030
really as sort of part of that work is

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,339
why I'm here talking to you today I

19
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:04,019
mentioned that yes I was here in 2014

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,960
that I was in fact here talking about

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,830
CSS grid layout slightly jumping the gun

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,259
it has to be said because CSS grid

23
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:15,450
layout didn't ship into browsers until

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,470
the spring of 2017 we were all well

25
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,540
prepared and I was starting to feel a

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,430
bit like the CSS vaporware lady by the

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,409
time it eventually got out into browsers

28
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:26,579
so I was quite pleased when it did

29
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,579
eventually happen

30
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:32,310
so a carrot two years on amazingly

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,619
although I feel like I've now spent half

32
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:35,700
of my life talking about this

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,610
specification and I've shipped stuff you

34
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,170
know I've got production sites that use

35
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,729
grid a lot of you have probably got

36
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,350
production sites that are using grid to

37
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,740
some extent and we're starting to see

38
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,869
people coming back and saying well this

39
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,390
grid things all really good and but I've

40
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,159
discovered that it doesn't do this or

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,479
I've got this use case that doesn't

42
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,560
really work properly

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,110
you know how are we going to how can we

44
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,329
do that so I'm kind of interested really

45
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,549
in what's next

46
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,899
I really sort of see myself as a problem

47
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,180
solver whatever I've done in the

48
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,610
industry has been about solving problems

49
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,470
and that's why I really love working on

50
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,050
CSS because we've got all of these

51
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,599
amazing problems to solve everywhere you

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,500
look there's a new problem

53
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,790
someone's bringing a problem and which I

54
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,400
work out to do that and one of the

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,870
problems that was that we sort of

56
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,310
immediately started to see and we kind

57
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,540
of knew this was going to be an issue

58
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,830
was this issue that grid items you know

59
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,290
you can say display grid but only the

60
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,080
direct children of the grid become grid

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,210
items so only they can be laid out on

62
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,620
the grid that you've created if you

63
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,510
create a twelve column grid only the

64
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,170
direct children can sit on that grid and

65
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,910
in the level one specification we had

66
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,120
this idea of sub grids and it didn't get

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,890
implemented by anyone and we sort of

68
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,360
changed how maybe that was going to

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,280
happen and and there was some debate

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,020
about it and eventually it was removed

71
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,480
from the specification from the level

72
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,100
one spec so he kind of finished that

73
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,650
specification but I was very very keen

74
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,690
that this sub grid feature wouldn't go

75
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,120
away and as soon as people started using

76
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,580
grid I could see that yes people really

77
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,390
did need this sub grid feature so this

78
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,630
is kind of the really good example of

79
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,020
why you might need sub grid we've got a

80
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,730
pattern like this you've got a set of

81
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,769
cards and they've got neat headers and

82
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,350
footers I imagine that everyone has had

83
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,390
a designer bring to them a design like

84
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,730
this with all of the same content in all

85
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,190
of the boxes because that's exactly how

86
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,040
all websites work we have an identical

87
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,040
content in every box all of the time and

88
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,900
of course you get it you implement this

89
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,400
you say well that's a nice grid layout

90
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,380
really easy grid layout like your basic

91
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,330
grid example will give you that layout

92
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,850
so you build that layout and then you

93
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,269
get it into the CMS and this happens and

94
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,690
then the designer says no those footers

95
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,280
are all supposed to line up with each

96
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,570
other and you're like yeah and it's kind

97
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,250
of like we've pushed this problem a

98
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,630
level deeper because we used to have

99
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,769
this problem we had this problem with

100
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:10,060
floats that you couldn't line at the

101
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,310
bottom of the boxes and then we got grid

102
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,810
and we own flexbox and we could line at

103
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,970
the bottom of our boxes but if your

104
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,880
boxes are nested inside a grid item even

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,070
if they are a grid themselves

106
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,690
you still can't line at the boxes

107
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,450
because they're independent grids and

108
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,610
this is a fundamental thing about using

109
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,070
the display property values of display

110
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,360
don't inherit

111
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,980
so the kind of wine back and understand

112
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,130
the actual problem CSS has got this

113
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,530
concept of normal flow or block and

114
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,780
inline layout and that's pretty much the

115
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,520
first thing you learn when you learn CSS

116
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,919
you've got block things and they kind of

117
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,389
spread out and take up all the space and

118
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,400
you've got inline things like words and

119
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,650
they go next to each other

120
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,050
now that's normal flow and it can be

121
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,389
worth thinking that essentially CSS is

122
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,699
always trying to go back to this layout

123
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,310
method so you can change the value of

124
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,650
display you can make something display

125
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,840
flex you can make something display grid

126
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,270
and it's children will become flex or

127
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,700
grid items but they're children the

128
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,400
internals of those boxes they go right

129
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,490
back to normal flow now that's kind of a

130
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,290
good thing because otherwise once you

131
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,479
said display grid you'd then have to go

132
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,490
and say oh you know these things inside

133
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,900
our grid items you can't really be

134
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,100
setting yourself all the way down

135
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,440
because generally normal flow is what

136
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,060
you want it means that we can write the

137
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,070
page of HTML and just load up in a

138
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,380
browser and it's readable you know most

139
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,830
the time that's actually what you want

140
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,360
so here's a simple flex example we've

141
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,800
got a normal flow heading and a

142
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,060
paragraph didn't have to do anything

143
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,830
about their layout then I've got this

144
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,320
meteor object said display flex and the

145
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,270
image in the content our Flex items but

146
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,130
the content has a heading and some and a

147
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,320
paragraph that's gone right back there

148
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,260
to normal flow so that's kind of what's

149
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,210
happening and that's why we can't just

150
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,070
make things the nest is somewhere in the

151
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,630
structure participate in the grid our

152
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,210
card internals I've made my card a grid

153
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,830
so I can make my grid item I can nest

154
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,110
grid to make my grid item a grid itself

155
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,419
so each of my cards a little mini grids

156
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,270
but they don't know about each other and

157
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,710
I've got the Firefox good inspector

158
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,050
turned on here now and you can see the

159
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,849
grid on that card and you can see how

160
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,340
the lines are extending out and they're

161
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,050
not lined up with all the other cards

162
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,200
there so we have this problem there are

163
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,010
some times where we do want things nest

164
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,750
it down inside the structure to be able

165
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,030
to somehow participate in the grid that

166
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,770
we have defined on the parent now we do

167
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,289
have a way to make indirect children use

168
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,129
a grid or a flex layout

169
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,300
and some of you might have come across

170
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,589
so ready we've got display contents now

171
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:53,779
display contents is one of the box

172
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,599
generation values if you say display

173
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:59,269
none that removes the box and everything

174
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:01,279
inside it so it's as if that thing was

175
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,619
never there on in your design as you can

176
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,239
say display:none on a container

177
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:07,659
everything inside gone can't see it

178
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,610
display contents does a similar thing

179
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,649
with the box itself but leaves the

180
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,899
children alone so if you've got a box

181
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,719
you say display contents on that box the

182
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:19,699
box is removed but the children stay

183
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,800
visible and then participate in whatever

184
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,699
layout they then become a child of so

185
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,289
I've got a little example of that we've

186
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,689
got a grid layout here and nested inside

187
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:32,269
one of the grid items is actually a ul

188
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:34,429
and a nested inside that it's got some

189
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:39,229
list items so there's the HTML so I've

190
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:40,729
got a div with the class of grid that's

191
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:42,829
gonna be my grid container I think got

192
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,139
two divs there direct children I've got

193
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,809
are you well that is also a direct child

194
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:50,569
and then inside that you well there are

195
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:57,529
some list items that you can see so

196
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,439
there's the CSS the direct grid children

197
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,899
have that sort of pale background on

198
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,079
them so the UL as well and the direct UL

199
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,389
children they have a pink background so

200
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:09,829
we can see that they're actually a child

201
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,129
of the UL and not a child of the grid

202
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:15,079
now if I wanted to remove the box of the

203
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,539
UL I need to say display contents on the

204
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,169
UL it vanishes the list items can now

205
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,969
participate in the grid layout and lay

206
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,490
themselves out so that's pretty cool

207
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,709
that solves some sort of pattern and you

208
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,240
can see that's only happening to the Box

209
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,099
the children are still the direct

210
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:32,449
children of a ul they've still got that

211
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:33,949
pink background color because they're

212
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:36,110
still a direct child everything else

213
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,589
still applies just the box of the UL has

214
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,430
been visually removed but that does not

215
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,189
solve our card problem if we display

216
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:50,569
contents our card we get this because

217
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:53,089
the card box has been removed and so we

218
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,430
now have the sort of components inside

219
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,559
the card the header and the contents and

220
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,180
the footer and now beam order placed

221
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,960
across the grid

222
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,330
and that's not what we wanted that might

223
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,040
be a pattern that you want sometimes but

224
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,420
it's not the pattern that we're trying

225
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,570
to build today and I can't talk about

226
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,339
display contents as well without a

227
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,920
little warning that although it has

228
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,870
pretty good browser support there is

229
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,630
also a really gnarly accessibility bug

230
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,310
when you say display:none that does

231
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,980
actually make the thing invisible for

232
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,360
screen readers and so on as well it's

233
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,500
like it goes away and then you might

234
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,300
want to bring it back later display

235
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,370
content is only supposed to affect the

236
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,980
visual display but due to a bug in

237
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,839
browsers it is actually removing

238
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,790
elements from the accessibility tree and

239
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,220
therefore rendering it not very useful

240
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,540
for the things it would be useful for

241
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,279
which is allowing something to have a

242
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,920
semantic box around it for you know

243
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,300
semantic purposes and for accessibility

244
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,779
purposes and saying hey I'm a list it's

245
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,250
actually removing that information as

246
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:52,700
well

247
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,070
browsers are fixing this I think Firefox

248
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,360
have pretty much fixed it

249
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,390
I know chrome have been you know fixing

250
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,010
it I've been seeing the notifications on

251
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,050
that issue coming through so browsers

252
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,580
are taking this very seriously now it's

253
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,959
been pointed out and are fixing the

254
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,970
problem but if you do decide to use

255
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,550
display contents just test very very

256
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,320
carefully in assistive technology that

257
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,779
you haven't made a terrible mess while

258
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,779
doing it

259
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,000
however we'll go back to our cards and

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,620
our issue of wanting these card

261
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,410
internals to line up using display

262
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,360
contents even if it wasn't boogy and had

263
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,160
great browser support that doesn't give

264
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,720
us what we want because we want to keep

265
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,520
our boxers we want to keep our card

266
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,900
backgrounds so what are we going to do

267
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,510
and it's this issue is where sub-grid

268
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,980
becomes useful so this is a value for

269
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,779
grid template columns and grid template

270
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:47,180
rows and it basically makes it possible

271
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,579
for you to declare that the children of

272
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:52,490
a grid item become a sub grid and that's

273
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,200
much easier to understand with some

274
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,810
examples and all of the code for these

275
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,029
examples is online and it's with my

276
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,560
resources so you can go and have a look

277
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,390
and play around rather than trying to

278
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,950
sort of squint it on the screen and work

279
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:09,170
out what's going on so we can make a

280
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,200
grid item a grid you can say display

281
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,270
grid as

282
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,150
are down as you like but at the moment

283
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,950
that grid becomes this unique

284
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,200
independent thing it's a nested grid

285
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,300
it's completely separate to the parent

286
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,180
it has different lines for columns and

287
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,750
rows if you want that nested thing to

288
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,340
line up with a parent you're gonna have

289
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,840
to do some very careful things with your

290
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,020
track sizing to make that work so here

291
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,090
I've got some CSS defining an outer grid

292
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,310
and that's got the white border on and

293
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,960
there's an item that sits on that grid

294
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,300
and the items also a grid with column

295
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,280
and row tracks and the serve item sits

296
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,930
on that which the serve item the pink

297
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,820
thing is on the internal grid so again

298
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,170
five got screwed inspect if you're

299
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,180
working with grids or with Flex box that

300
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,950
you know the inspectors in Firefox are

301
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,630
fantastic you really really do want to

302
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,190
be using them make everything so much

303
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,540
easier when you can see where the lines

304
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,400
are of your grid especially playing

305
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,290
around with this stuff so you turn on

306
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,670
the Firefox good inspector and you can

307
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,680
see the outer grid there on the parent

308
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,300
you can see how that pink box doesn't

309
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,830
line up with those grid lines it's

310
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,820
separate and if we have a look at the

311
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,050
grid on the child

312
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,190
there's the grid on the child and the

313
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,870
pink box lines up with the lines that

314
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,590
are on the child so fairly recently in

315
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,760
firefox you've been delayed bailout

316
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,590
source of set multiple grids display

317
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,180
them at once very handy if you're using

318
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,550
sub grid so you can kind of see how the

319
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,130
lines line up and or don't line up in

320
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,200
this case when we're looking at our item

321
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,970
so it basically sort of started over

322
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,650
with a new grid and so what sub grid

323
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,340
lets us do it lets us selectively opt

324
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,670
grids into the parent grid so we can

325
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,370
decide if we want to opt our columns or

326
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,830
rows or both into using at the parent

327
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,960
tracks so what I've done here I've said

328
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,230
grid template columns sub grid and you

329
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,810
can see what's happened the item is now

330
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,940
using the columns that are defined on

331
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,340
the parent and so the pink item is now

332
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,200
positioned according to those lines not

333
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,660
to any internal lines and therefore it

334
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,730
lines up with the rest of the tracks now

335
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,170
we could do this for rows we could say

336
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,960
grid template rows sub grid and here I'm

337
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,610
defining my own column so the columns

338
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,960
don't line up and that's because that's

339
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,310
what I decided I will

340
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,410
but here four rows were using the two

341
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,320
rows row tracks that are created and the

342
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,600
item is sort of been being stretched

343
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,100
over those because that we're going

344
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:42,460
across two tracks we can also create a

345
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,430
sub grid in both dimensions so that will

346
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,890
tie our sub grid completely to the

347
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,870
tracks that are available for rows and

348
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,240
four columns so here were saying grid

349
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,740
template columns sub grid and grid

350
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,610
template rows sub grid and that's really

351
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,070
the basics of the spec it's a very

352
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,390
simple thing it is essentially just

353
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,510
another value for grid template columns

354
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,550
and grid template rows that says you

355
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,660
know I'm not going to define my own

356
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,340
columns or rows I'm just going to use

357
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,140
the ones that are already there on the

358
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,990
parent now as with any specification

359
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,430
there are some subtleties there there

360
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,900
are some things you might need to be

361
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,050
aware of one of those is that line

362
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,360
numbers we don't use the line number

363
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,890
from the parent because if you did you'd

364
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,450
have to figure out exactly where on the

365
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,400
parent your sub grid component was that

366
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,720
might change it could be a component you

367
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,670
use all over the place so line numbers

368
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,490
restart inside the sub grid so in that

369
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,440
way a sub grid is no different to

370
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,800
declaring the the the tracks and use the

371
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,720
line numbers they start from one if your

372
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,060
work in English which is left-to-right

373
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,530
line one is from Y on the left-hand side

374
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,320
of your sub grid component just working

375
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,660
in exactly the same way that a normal

376
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,490
grid would so in this example here you

377
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,980
can see that column line one is actually

378
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,110
on line two of the parent grid now you

379
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,450
might want to know where on the grid

380
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,640
your sub grid is you might care about

381
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,620
lining up against a line that's actually

382
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,760
in the parent are lining up something

383
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,070
inside that grid but again it's lying

384
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,020
the parent and to do that if you name

385
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,900
your parent lines they will get passed

386
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,990
into the sub grid so you've used line

387
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,450
names on the on the parent they'll get

388
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,160
passed in and you can reuse them when

389
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,810
you position things inside the sub grid

390
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,840
so for instance if on my parent I've

391
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,690
named cold start and call end when I'm

392
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,430
positioning the pink item inside the sub

393
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,650
grid I can say call start and call end

394
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,450
rather than worrying about the line

395
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,320
numbers

396
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,910
I have a feeling that more people will

397
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,190
use named limes once they're using

398
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,920
subgrade quite a bit so don't EE see so

399
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,230
many people using named lines it's not

400
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,700
saying that tend to get in my email

401
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,410
people asking about I have a feeling

402
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,580
that once people start to use subgrade

403
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,870
the named lines that get passed through

404
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,560
might be quite useful so here's the code

405
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,570
for that and you can see where we named

406
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,010
lines with the square brackets we're

407
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,420
naming the line and then you've got the

408
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,000
track size coming after it and then our

409
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,240
sub-item can actually use those those

410
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,680
names when we place the item but you

411
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,720
might also want some names that just a

412
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,430
scope to that sub gridded item you might

413
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,350
want to give the sub grid lines some

414
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,840
names and now we do that by basically

415
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,750
listing the line names after the sub

416
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,880
grid keyword who don't have tracts in

417
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,790
order to put our lines between so they

418
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,380
look a bit like that so you might say

419
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,180
you've got your sub grid keyword and

420
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,980
then you're going to have all of the

421
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,050
named tracks in square brackets because

422
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,270
that's how we name those things so there

423
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,530
I've just named two lines so this with

424
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,060
our example would let us do something

425
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,060
like this I've got my named lines on the

426
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,340
parent I've also named all of the lines

427
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,280
of my sub grid and so I've got I can use

428
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,870
either to position things I can use the

429
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,310
parent line so I can use the sub grid

430
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,730
lines it's up to me and so here's sort

431
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,350
of a little worked example of that I've

432
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,180
got my named lines on the parent now

433
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,040
I've added my named lines on the child

434
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,470
and then I'm positioning two items one

435
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,020
using parent lines and one using child

436
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,110
lines so that's sort of a useful way to

437
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,170
be able to so scope line names to just

438
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:19,990
the the circuited item itself I think

439
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,329
fairly obviously and logically the sub

440
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,280
grid inherits the gaps from the parent

441
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,290
so if you've used the gap property your

442
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,300
row gap or column gap that's gonna get

443
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,180
passed through into the sub gridded item

444
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,350
which i think is probably what you'd

445
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,600
expect if you've got gaps on the parent

446
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,710
in your lining things up against the

447
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,110
parent you'd probably expect that would

448
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,570
get passed through into your child item

449
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,490
and you can sort of see how that works

450
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,750
here but sometimes you want things to

451
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,670
line up with a parent tracks but you

452
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,260
might actually want to say close the gap

453
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,920
between two items perhaps you've

454
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,140
you know some content with a box below

455
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,700
it you don't want to have a visible gap

456
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,400
between the two things so to enable that

457
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,750
we can change the gaps on the sub grid

458
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,130
so you just used the gap properties as

459
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,110
normal on that sub grid at item so you

460
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,120
could if you wanted no gap like in this

461
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,210
example I've said row gap zero setting

462
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,220
the gap to zero and it's a bit like if

463
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,710
add as a negative margin then to the

464
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,380
item so it will sort of get into the gap

465
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,570
and it won't expand out of the top of

466
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,130
the there so good that would be really

467
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,020
weird and not very useful it will just

468
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,730
go down into any gaps and sort of fill

469
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,210
in the gap if you had said a larger gap

470
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,130
than is on the parent but it's as if

471
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,600
you've added a margin and it will sort

472
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,300
of you know go in but it's like that the

473
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,980
line of the grid sort of runs down the

474
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,950
middle of the gap basically and you can

475
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,990
sort of get into that by setting the gap

476
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,950
to zero

477
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:50,240
or whatever you want and hopefully it's

478
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,500
me it's sort of fairly obvious so I'm

479
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,210
looking at this stuff that sizing of

480
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,590
items in the sub grid can obviously

481
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,920
change the size of the parent tracks so

482
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,960
if you've got a row which is set to auto

483
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,360
which is the default for for grid tracks

484
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,400
and you put more and more content and

485
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,870
that's going to obviously make the sub

486
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,240
gridded row grow but as long as the

487
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,820
parent rows is auto that will grow as

488
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,160
well so it kind of works pretty much as

489
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,440
you'd expect it works pretty much like

490
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,840
you've just nested a grid and you happen

491
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,610
to be using you at the tracks from the

492
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,550
parent but everything else works in kind

493
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,110
of the way you'd expect if you've nested

494
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,880
one grid inside the other or if you've

495
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,280
already got designs where you're nesting

496
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,320
one grid inside the other so this is how

497
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,020
we would get our card example to work

498
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,730
we'd basically stretch our card over

499
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,250
three tracks of the grid which means

500
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,620
that the footers are now all in the same

501
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,900
row which means they all line up with

502
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,760
each other and when our footer which is

503
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,920
taller makes that row bigger it makes

504
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,080
the whole row bigger and we just get

505
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,810
space below the items that don't have as

506
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,210
much content which is really what we

507
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,390
wanted and we can also remove the gaps

508
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,580
throw on the parent grid on the child if

509
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,380
we don't want to have the bigger row gap

510
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,970
which we have between the

511
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,730
two items so this is this is pretty cool

512
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,500
this allows us to create that pattern it

513
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,170
allows us to nest grids and let them

514
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,330
then participate in the sizing really of

515
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,820
the parent and you can do this really as

516
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,170
far down as you need to do now I've been

517
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,430
playing around this for a little while

518
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,040
and just sort of I like to sort of think

519
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,080
Oh will this solve any other problems

520
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,790
that we've got and because you know this

521
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,290
is a sort of very obvious use case

522
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,910
having a set of cards like this this was

523
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,350
one of the first things that was brought

524
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,200
to me well why can't we do this there's

525
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,430
also the example of you know maybe

526
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,110
having like a 12 column layout and

527
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,400
wanting things that are nested

528
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,530
further down in the structure to also

529
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,540
use that same 12 column layout they're

530
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,090
kind of the obvious sub grid examples

531
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,520
but I think there's a few other things

532
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,680
that I've started to realize we can do

533
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,240
because we've got sub grid and yeah this

534
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,200
is one of them if you use an explicit

535
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,600
grid so this is where you say grid

536
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,520
template columns and define the track

537
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,290
some grid template rows and define the

538
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,330
tracks that creates what we call the

539
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,700
explicit grid the difference between

540
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,260
that and the implicit grid is the

541
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,790
implicit grid is when you just say oh

542
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,770
create as many rows as you want to fill

543
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,600
this to fill up with content which I

544
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,220
think is a lot of the time what we do if

545
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,080
you've got a set of cards like this and

546
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,450
you just want them to keep on filling

547
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,280
cards and keep creating grid rows as

548
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,260
many as you need you would just use the

549
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,470
implicit grid now in practice pretty

550
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,820
much the only difference between the

551
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,440
explicit grid and the implicit grid that

552
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,200
people run into is that you can target

553
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
the end line of the explicit grid with

554
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,410
minus one in other dimension which does

555
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,850
mean that you can you know if you're

556
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,920
using the explicit grid you can say 1 2

557
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,500
minus 1 on other elements and it will

558
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,240
span to the end of the grid so that's

559
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,130
what we're doing here I've got five

560
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,580
explicit grid rows my items are have

561
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,200
been placed into that and I've got one

562
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,170
item which is positions from grid Row 1

563
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,870
to minus 1 and minus 1 is the end line

564
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,580
of the explicit grid so it stretches to

565
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,160
full height and that's really what I

566
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,850
wanted to happen but then I have to

567
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,440
remember that line minus 1 is the end

568
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,480
line if the explicit grid so if I don't

569
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,310
know how

570
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,230
many of those items I'm going to have I

571
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,880
don't know how many rows I'm gonna have

572
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,950
them I have one row or might have a

573
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,920
hundred rows I don't know and so I can't

574
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,200
actually get it though row minus one

575
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,000
because I'm going to use the implicit

576
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,040
grid I'm going to create as many tracks

577
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,170
as I need and so if I try and do that

578
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,320
one two minus one thing that happens and

579
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,270
that's not what I wanted at all and this

580
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,920
comes up a lot I would get a lot of

581
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,020
people asking well how can I span to the

582
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,630
end of my implicit tracks and I'm like

583
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,790
well not very easily because we don't

584
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,040
know what we've got so what I really

585
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,620
what I want that pink block to be lined

586
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,670
up with the rest of the cogs what it

587
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,840
have the same size as the rest of the

588
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,250
columns they're going to be flexible and

589
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,990
but I want to be able to get to the end

590
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:05,000
of the number of rows that are created

591
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,420
so this is what that sort of looks like

592
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,120
and in terms of the CSS where I'm you

593
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,340
know I've got no defined implicit rows

594
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,990
I'm using a grid Auto rows to give my

595
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:19,360
rows a height so what I'm looking at

596
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,770
that then we can't talk that inline the

597
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,450
implicit grid I'm looking at sub grid

598
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,160
I'm thinking I think we can probably

599
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,530
solve this with sub grid because we've

600
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,200
now got a way of saying I want all my

601
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,630
columns to be everything lined up in

602
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,570
columns but those items to be able to

603
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,720
create implicit tracks and so it does

604
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,130
involve an extra container because I

605
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,290
needed something to sub grid so I've

606
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,450
added a container a wrapper around my

607
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,430
items and that's going to use a sub grid

608
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,290
for columns so that means that the

609
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,820
column tracks are going to be the same

610
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,580
for the the item which is outside of the

611
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,440
wrapper and the items that are inside

612
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,310
the wrapper so you can see there where

613
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,410
I've got my items and they're just

614
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,780
creating as many rows as they need

615
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,390
inside that sub gridded area so I'm not

616
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,890
going to submit on rows I've got a sub

617
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,720
grid on columns I'm just creating the

618
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,940
items one of one row after the other as

619
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,810
many as I need

620
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,630
but that pink item is essentially just

621
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,870
put in one row of the parent grid so it

622
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,880
can stretch as tall as it needs no

623
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,130
matter how many rows are created and

624
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,980
that basically just looks like this so

625
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,780
I've still got no to find explicit rows

626
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,420
and I've got the items there which is a

627
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,880
sub grid for the columns so that the the

628
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,240
pink

629
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,620
item could be the same size as all the

630
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,360
other items and then I've got the full

631
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,610
height one which is going one two minus

632
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,610
one but essentially just in one row of

633
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,980
the parent grid now we can use that we

634
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,179
can do that when we've got sub grid

635
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:45,100
because sub grid lets us sort of used

636
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,350
that that one grid on the parents for

637
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,850
everything to be lined up column wise

638
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,070
and let me do something different with

639
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,170
my rows I think as we start playing with

640
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,400
this there's probably quite a few other

641
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,320
little pans that aren't obvious sub grid

642
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,090
candidates but they will be able to fix

643
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,640
by using the sub grid now that's all

644
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,980
marvelous but in my role as CSS

645
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,620
vaporware lady I need to have some bad

646
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,020
news and that's fact that we don't

647
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,150
actually have anything in a live browser

648
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,770
that's going to be in front of your

649
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,450
clients just yet that's good isn't it I

650
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,610
like that I'm gonna be sad when someone

651
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,960
ships it and I'll not be able to show

652
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,330
while it's all red but slightly better

653
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,040
news is that Firefox have actually

654
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,780
shipped sub grid in nightly just last

655
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,980
week all Lizzie yeah I forgot the

656
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,960
Firefox so everything I've shown you

657
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,030
here is there they're screenshots

658
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,350
they're all screenshots from Firefox

659
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,500
nightly you can get a copy of Firefox

660
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,940
nightly and all the examples from this

661
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,870
talk will work and so if you don't have

662
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,240
a copy of any please go and download it

663
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,820
and have a play it is really really

664
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,140
important that you do and I'm going to

665
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,179
quote myself from 2014 or someone

666
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:01,390
quoting me in 2014 you know if you wait

667
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,309
until a spec is done and implemented to

668
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:04,929
have a look and say it's rubbish well

669
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:09,040
it's too late and browsers putting stuff

670
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,020
out for us behind flags or in like

671
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,390
nightly versions of browsers they give

672
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:16,480
us a chance to contribute because while

673
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,429
a spec is only in you know well we've

674
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:20,050
got all that read on can I use that

675
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,970
means that so grid is not in anybody's

676
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,100
hands get it's not out on any production

677
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,140
websites nothing is going to break if we

678
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,030
have to change something and that's the

679
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,800
same for any spec that is in development

680
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,840
that's just you know just starting to

681
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,300
get out there and one of the browsers it

682
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,610
is really the best time to be able to

683
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,429
play with that and to say hang on I can

684
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,440
see a use case that this nearly solves

685
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,420
but doesn't quite perhaps perhaps

686
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,090
it could so it's a time for us to

687
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,760
contribute and I think it's more

688
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,620
important than ever that web developers

689
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,270
get involved with the web platform we've

690
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,100
got a version of grid to experiment with

691
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,750
in the first place so the reason that I

692
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,700
had grid you know now is playing around

693
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,790
with it from sort of 2011 or so and was

694
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,640
because it was implemented prefixed in

695
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,490
IE 10 and that implementation was

696
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,200
pivotal in allowing people like me to

697
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,180
play with it and evangelize the spec and

698
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,740
hopefully try and get the interest of

699
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,600
web developers and actually try and help

700
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
move this forward and I think as we have

701
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,950
fewer rendering engines

702
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,170
we're losing places where those

703
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,060
experiments might happen and I think

704
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,100
that makes it even more important that

705
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,650
us as the web development community use

706
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,210
our influence on the browser's to the

707
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,570
left and we do have influence and so how

708
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,800
do we indicate what it is that we

709
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,950
actually want the first thing we just

710
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,570
need to tell browsers what we want in

711
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,520
the platform and we can often just do

712
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,720
that by going along to their book

713
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,880
trackers here is the book in chromium

714
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,330
for subgrade support and just flagging

715
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,970
up there's a like thing or a follow star

716
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,680
you can you can click on there to say

717
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,600
you know yes I think so good is

718
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,010
important I would like to have it and

719
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,980
here is a handy QR code you can use that

720
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,870
QR code you will go directly to that

721
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,150
book tracker and you can just like that

722
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,770
book and don't leave sort of me to

723
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,390
comments on bugs you know and we're not

724
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,250
here to pester browser engineers but

725
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,020
we're just here to say hey yes this is

726
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,330
something that I need as a web developer

727
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,330
I would find it useful if you would like

728
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,980
just off talk a bit more about it and

729
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,020
share a bit more information then write

730
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,940
up features like so good or anything

731
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,350
else that you want to see in browsers

732
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,180
right of your use case write up the

733
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,890
problems that your feature will solve

734
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,530
because it's seeing those use cases you

735
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,060
know web developers actually saying hey

736
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,890
we need this and we need this because of

737
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,380
this reason that's very compelling for

738
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,330
people on the working group browser

739
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,500
vendors to actually think about

740
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,050
implementing it and solving a new

741
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,640
problem sometimes we get a feature that

742
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,040
is just in one browser for example it's

743
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,960
likely that Firefox are going to ship

744
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,450
sub-grid before anybody else at which

745
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,370
point the entire web community will say

746
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,440
yeah Rachel that's very nice

747
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,880
use it because it's only supported in

748
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,830
one browser now we've got feature

749
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,960
queries you could potentially use sub

750
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,420
grid as enhancements you could ship

751
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,980
something like that card design and

752
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,890
which does have obviously not lined up

753
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,770
headers and footers that's fine if the

754
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,510
browser has sub grid we can check for

755
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,300
sub grid and we can use sub grid for the

756
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,560
browsers that support it the ones our

757
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,140
supporter it looks better now this is

758
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,960
important because if we're using it then

759
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,760
browsers are having a look to see what

760
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,530
it is that we're using because if you're

761
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,550
a browser that doesn't implement

762
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,650
something you don't want everyone saying

763
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,360
well it looks better in this other

764
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,520
browser so it kind of sends a message

765
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,880
we're using this we'd like to have it

766
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,840
and also use new features when they're

767
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,910
behind a flag or in a nightly version of

768
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,850
the browser as I say this is your chance

769
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,160
to be to test the web platform and offer

770
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,710
feedback you know you can you can be a

771
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,780
beta tester of this stuff and you can

772
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,120
actually make it better with your

773
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,120
feedback and so what do you do with the

774
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,620
feedback well you might find a bug if

775
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,360
you find a browser bug if it's like well

776
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,400
the spec says you should do this find a

777
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,930
browser book it's not log to go and log

778
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,430
it that's really helpful to the browser

779
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,920
engineers who are working on this if you

780
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,450
find something that's missing from the

781
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,240
specification then come and tell the CSS

782
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,970
working group all of the CSS working

783
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,310
group issues are on github so you can

784
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,080
come onto github you can search the

785
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,520
issues we're pretty good at them then

786
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,870
being sort of marked up with the name of

787
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,370
the spec so you can search like CSS

788
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,250
squid issues for example if you realize

789
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,230
that your issue is not locked and we're

790
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,760
not talking about it then you know you

791
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,170
can add a new issue just like you can

792
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,750
against any project you know CSS is just

793
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,300
like any other open source project it's

794
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,610
just a very big one it's quite a long

795
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,620
time to get things sorted but we are

796
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,540
interested in the things that you have

797
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,300
to say so you can raise an issue

798
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,380
particularly it's around layout you can

799
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,880
always then prod me and say hey I've

800
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,020
raised this issue you know could you

801
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,060
have a look when much rather be able to

802
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,170
kind of promote the things that are

803
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,070
coming out of the web development

804
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,870
community it's a lot more powerful than

805
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,640
the stuff coming from just right inside

806
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,820
the working group so this is that this

807
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,680
is just the issues repo there as I say

808
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,850
you can see in the square brackets the

809
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,410
names of the specs and it go and have a

810
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,490
poke around anything that you're

811
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,320
particularly interested in go and have a

812
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,820
look and see the sort of things the sort

813
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:09,970
of

814
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,490
work that's being done it can take a

815
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,140
while for things to be discussed but

816
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,520
when we do discuss things at a

817
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,430
face-to-face meeting or on our phone

818
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,210
conferences

819
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,640
that's all minuted and the minutes are

820
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,110
then posted back to the issue so you can

821
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,310
kind of follow along and see what the

822
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,580
progress of something is I'm really very

823
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,770
very keen to encourage people to

824
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,830
participate in the web platform and if

825
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,630
you're people who build things using

826
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,130
these features then you're exactly the

827
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,180
sort of people who should be

828
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,430
contributing and the browser engineers

829
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,780
people work on browsers and the people

830
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,640
who write specifications are all very

831
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,290
very clever folk but a lot of them don't

832
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,850
build websites anymore or haven't built

833
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,100
websites were a very long time so kind

834
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,650
of your input is really really important

835
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,090
and also as a person who uses CSS you

836
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,880
get an awful lot back by working on this

837
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,290
stuff by getting involved with this

838
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,410
stuff yeah I left school at 16 I've got

839
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,900
no maths or science background and the

840
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,640
things I have learned by just

841
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,590
contributing and yet some has been told

842
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,750
I'm wrong but having conversations with

843
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,310
browser engineers and people who have

844
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,840
really in-depth knowledge of this stuff

845
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,950
you know I couldn't have learned that

846
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,450
stuff on any course I couldn't have

847
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,860
learned that stuff out of any books and

848
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,140
so contributing has actually given me a

849
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,450
huge amount back and I really would

850
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,100
encourage anyone whether you're brand

851
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,600
new to the industry you've been doing it

852
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,370
for years to see how you can get

853
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,860
involved follow along and do speak up

854
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,540
and she might be the only person who's

855
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,250
actually spotted that missing use case

856
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,690
and you know you don't have to been

857
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,770
doing CSS forever

858
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,180
to realize that there's a glaring hole

859
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,940
that no one has noticed so please do get

860
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,550
involved and all of my demos and so on

861
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,410
are at that URL and I'm around all day

862
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,510
I'm always very very happy to talk about

863
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,300
layout thank you very much

864
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,080
[Applause]
