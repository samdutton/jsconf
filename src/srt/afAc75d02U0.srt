[Music]

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,900
hello thank you so much for for having

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,469
the year

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,430
I'm incredibly intimidated but I will

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,460
try to get through it a little bit about

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,609
me my name is Ivana I work at a company

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,279
called customer i/o we're based in

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,619
Portland but it's a remote company so I

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,590
live in work in Vancouver in Canada I

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,590
was born in Bosnia though raised in

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,960
Croatia lived all over Canada and then

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,610
spent several years in Scotland most

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,370
recently I have a degree in psychology

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,860
and neuroscience but realized too late

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,320
that I didn't want to be an academic and

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,680
right now I'm a UX designer but have

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,020
worked as an interaction designer a

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,190
freelancer and front-end designer and

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,199
I've had the pleasure of CSS being

20
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,739
involved in all of those things so over

21
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,100
time and across countries I've made lots

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,229
of internet friends and real-life

23
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,920
friends and as a result I've always been

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,650
really into how we build our communities

25
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,369
on the web both socially and from a code

26
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,689
perspective as well and how those things

27
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,960
interact so now that you know a little

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,159
bit about me I want to ask you guys what

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,090
do you do um what do you call yourself

30
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,820
we don't often describe our roles in one

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,520
word because we know that there's

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,030
usually not one succinct title for them

33
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,619
we contextualize those job titles with

34
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,210
the technologies and the languages that

35
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,850
we work with but have no real common

36
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,610
language for these things front-end

37
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,619
engineer for example might mean

38
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,090
something really different to me than it

39
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,939
does to you someone saying they're a

40
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,860
software developer doesn't tell you

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,840
initially a lot about what they built or

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,960
what they used to build it but we

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,090
simplify right we contextualize and

44
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,210
categorize because that behavior makes

45
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,979
our lives easier it makes the world

46
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,239
easier to compute

47
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,120
but this category categorization excuse

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,110
me can harm our communities too because

49
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,060
how we categorize is based on what we

50
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,670
value and how we talk about our

51
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,030
profession about CSS that that matters

52
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,269
and that's what I want to talk about so

53
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,269
to do that we have to go back to to the

54
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:32,530
beginning we have to rewind a little bit

55
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,560
um it did start this way right like CSS

56
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,340
fit very easily into that kind of design

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,560
appearance bucket there's a clear

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,239
separation between design and

59
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,470
development you had a web designer and

60
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,910
now you kind of have designer and

61
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,370
developer like with visuals being one

62
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,130
thing and code another and you can sort

63
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,870
of see these lines building but the web

64
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,120
is growing in so many ways right and you

65
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,530
know not a day goes by that we don't see

66
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,180
a piece on medium and I'm pretty sure

67
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,730
written a few on how designers and

68
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,269
developers can work together best and

69
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,489
the reason we do that is because the

70
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:17,079
lines between them have blurred so much

71
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,510
that we don't even know what makes a

72
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,859
designer and what makes a developer

73
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:24,940
because the web isn't just a screen we

74
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,859
don't build a website we build an

75
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,180
application builds interfaces across

76
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,970
devices and contexts and interactions

77
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,160
are more dynamic these experiences are

78
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,430
more immersive and this needs how much

79
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,519
for wider variety of skill sets and I

80
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,440
think this is awesome right because as

81
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,420
the industry grows and so do our

82
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,389
capabilities so do our roles and our

83
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,840
skills we can generalize or even

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,510
specialize we can focus on CSS is a

85
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,920
whole or just on one small aspect of it

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,780
and this is really cool we talked a lot

87
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,329
about how we should work together how we

88
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,160
can make development and design work

89
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,200
together where CSS fits into that and

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,269
where we fit into that and yet yeah

91
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,030
we may not see this like outright of

92
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,229
course or maybe we do I've heard it but

93
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,910
the implication is always there it's

94
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,699
there when we ask what front end means

95
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,520
or doesn't mean it's there when we ask

96
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,770
you know which coding language should I

97
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,520
learn next and it's in job postings it's

98
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,500
in salaries it's in the word development

99
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,400
CSS used to just be designed so what is

100
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,289
it now this is an issue without a

101
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,889
resolution and that lack of resolution

102
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,389
has consequences we have so much

103
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,849
fluidity in our roles and that's okay

104
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,039
and but we need to produce software at

105
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,050
the end of the day and the titles that

106
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,930
we hold matter because they impact so

107
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,860
much hiring team construction perception

108
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,979
pay not to mention the actual experience

109
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:18,940
of what it is we're building and so no

110
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,440
it's not so much about developer and

111
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,759
designer because we don't build web

112
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,240
pages now the above simply isn't the

113
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,810
case anymore

114
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,139
it's not just fonts and colors and CSS

115
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:35,139
is code but not development why we say

116
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,270
that language is like HTML and CSS are

117
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,860
about presentation whereas programming

118
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,620
is meant to development is meant to

119
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,199
describe function and this was very

120
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,810
convenient but CSS has grown a lot right

121
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,620
we have pre-processors that require

122
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,449
developers level of understanding just

123
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,539
to implement and use meaningfully like

124
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,340
like if you looked at some of the docs

125
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,440
for these things it's like for a

126
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,669
beginner trying to walk or beginner

127
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,259
through some of it it's okay I just fire

128
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,210
up a terminal and install this and all

129
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,479
of these dependencies and no but that's

130
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,009
not development right anyway we have

131
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,300
transforms right we have complex

132
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,199
targeted selectors like pseudo elements

133
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,699
right and if you think about that name

134
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,320
for a second it kind of blows my mind a

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,980
little bit like pseudo

136
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,750
like it doesn't actually fists like

137
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,860
dynamically populated and with

138
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,480
methodologies like object-oriented CSS

139
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,230
CSS layout now and the point of all this

140
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,820
isn't is to show that it's not just

141
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,010
presentation and function the code might

142
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,050
looks really simple and people might say

143
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,280
oh it's just CSS but interaction and

144
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,690
presentation effects function and they

145
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,680
enable function CSS bridges all of that

146
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,990
it touches everything and expert level

147
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,850
CSS is a key development skill and these

148
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,800
days like was mentioned in the intro

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,270
people are showing off which you can do

150
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,130
with CSS and you can say that this is

151
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,100
just design right just aesthetics but

152
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,500
that that's missing the point the

153
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,760
implications of being able to do things

154
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,790
like this and just CSS was crazy

155
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,270
a while ago whole games can be built in

156
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,710
it I believe later today we're going to

157
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,950
learn how to do that and this is an

158
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,450
example of something that a friend of

159
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,250
mine created thanks Q it's a CSS

160
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,710
framework but it's made up of

161
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,720
self-contained modules and it's

162
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,070
developed in a way that draws from

163
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,800
JavaScript and from Ruby dependencies

164
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,810
are managed important serve specified

165
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,050
and because of its modularity the CSS

166
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,120
can actually be tested and also last

167
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,100
night at the speaker drink several sort

168
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,600
of folks who work primarily with

169
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,240
JavaScript said to me like I don't do

170
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,380
CSS CSS is hard like Rachel one of my

171
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,760
fellow speakers said like the most

172
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,580
complicated stuff I do with CSS but that

173
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,120
other more quote-unquote developer tasks

174
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,190
have more legitimacy with attached to

175
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,180
them and even if you you know do

176
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,010
subscribe to the whole like CSS is just

177
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,090
presentation fine as I mentioned

178
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,410
presentation influences the way that

179
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,390
people feel about software it enables

180
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,610
successful interaction if something

181
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,620
isn't presented and can be interacted

182
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,330
with in the right way

183
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,269
its function is irrelevant there need to

184
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,610
be people who stand that this or who

185
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,779
code I suppose at this intersection of

186
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:46,630
interaction function and presentation

187
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,010
and because of how complex the web is

188
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,080
they deserve their place in development

189
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,050
and that brings me to the main point

190
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,200
nice and my talk we're struggling to

191
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,269
delineate design and development in

192
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:01,310
terms of language to give those things

193
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,100
value and find out where we fit while

194
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,470
struggling with sort of bias and

195
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,620
archetypes and what happens when these

196
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,550
definitions of development and CSS are

197
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,360
unclear unspoken

198
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,899
and like tied up in these complex

199
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,519
perceptions of ourselves and our

200
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,190
competencies so hierarchies are about

201
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,959
drawing lines they're about identifying

202
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,570
differences and similarities and then

203
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,130
and this is the important part of

204
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,279
hierarchies assigning them rankings

205
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,829
assigning them relative importance this

206
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,829
lets us categorize and compare things

207
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,779
relatively speaking

208
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,880
things like languages the languages you

209
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,709
speak to organized in hierarchies or

210
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:49,279
colors evolutionary trees but the kind

211
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,750
of hierarchies that I'm talking about

212
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,660
here are value based on power and

213
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,430
authority in a CSS context and in

214
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,279
general we draw them because we like to

215
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,320
know that we have a place in society

216
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,959
within our communities we like to know

217
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,790
where we stand in relation to our others

218
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,640
were happy when we identify with a group

219
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,660
like a sports team or fans of a CSS CSS

220
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,360
framework for example and we're also

221
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,709
happy when we don't identify with

222
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,920
another group this is social identity

223
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,050
theory we define categories and then we

224
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,709
compare and you know right here were

225
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,010
here because we value CSS and identify

226
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,360
positively with those who have that

227
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,860
skill this conference wouldn't exist

228
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,940
otherwise and on some level these things

229
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,570
are good

230
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,519
like I said they help us process the

231
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,170
world faster and understand how to

232
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,899
interact socially it helped us they

233
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,190
helped us be less overwhelmed by the

234
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,310
world

235
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,370
they help employers apply people to the

236
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,130
right jobs somewhat and when we're in

237
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,500
those jobs they help us get our work

238
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,900
done and if we need help it lets us know

239
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,680
who to go to but they can also be bad

240
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,060
for the relative importance reasons that

241
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,240
I mentioned earlier and who defines that

242
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,850
importance so let's think about why for

243
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,790
a second

244
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,770
who defines this like if I ask you to

245
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,780
put some things in the development there

246
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,520
and the other things in not development

247
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,070
like where would you put them and what

248
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,380
about the person next to you or your

249
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,900
coworker I would venture to say that

250
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,140
those things wouldn't all be the same

251
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,190
and the fact that they wouldn't be is

252
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,190
something is what I want to address

253
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,410
because if you're hiring someone you

254
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,680
need to decide how much to pay them how

255
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,480
do you how do you do that what do you

256
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,010
decide first like do you decide the

257
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,490
technology stack of the the job maybe

258
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,160
the experience but we don't even know

259
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,060
what that means for a given language

260
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,560
especially if it hasn't been around that

261
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,300
long

262
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,890
so we're categorizing and determining

263
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,970
someone's value before they even exist

264
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,700
and these hierarchies that we have in

265
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,950
our minds you know the hiring manager

266
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,510
the engineers this person that will be

267
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,650
working with the designers up there

268
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,589
working with these all differ in subtle

269
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:10,310
ways and these ways then compound and

270
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,520
this impacts who you hire a CSS

271
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,900
developer for example might be what you

272
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,060
need but if you don't identify that as a

273
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,940
valued development thing you won't hire

274
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,150
that person and this is something that I

275
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,720
found interesting

276
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,570
astac overflows developer surveys they

277
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,850
didn't include CSS as a language like

278
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,540
anywhere but at least they're open about

279
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:33,810
it

280
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,070
and I think that the only valuable

281
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,630
hierarchies are clear transparent ones

282
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,460
and it's this lack of transparency

283
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,650
that's the problem we're not drawing

284
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,110
these hierarchies between skill levels

285
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,330
like manager and junior that's its own

286
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,050
thing but across languages we're

287
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,900
building tacit value-based hierarchies

288
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,930
based on languages that are biased by

289
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,020
our own investments

290
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,029
like of course I'm going to value CSS

291
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:03,640
higher than amber or whatever because

292
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,080
I've invested time and money into

293
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,540
learning it and I love it but I can't

294
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,850
assume that the person next to me feels

295
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,640
the same or if even that's what my

296
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,010
product needs so what's the point um why

297
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,899
are we trying to understand trying so

298
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,910
hard to understand what makes a

299
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,360
developer anyway because we need to were

300
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,990
compelled to in order to make our world

301
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,020
easier to understand but also because

302
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,209
these hierarchies affect CSS the

303
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:38,190
language the community and the web and

304
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,170
Tec is changing so fast that we have no

305
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,000
like agreed-upon standard for what a

306
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,550
developer is there's no degree or

307
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,350
certification or whatever and we pride

308
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,029
ourselves on that like anyone can jump

309
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,880
in and get their start in it I learned

310
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,670
development on like Neopets for like

311
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,180
anyone remembers that but it's a

312
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,500
double-edged sword because at the same

313
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,779
time we're trying to make sense of how

314
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,760
to pay people how to hire us and how to

315
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,190
actually make software and knowing that

316
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,899
we haven't figured that out is fine but

317
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,610
I'd argue that the way we're going about

318
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,160
it this implicit value building based on

319
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,750
like outdated assumptions about CSS

320
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,250
that's wrong because there's a gravitas

321
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,100
to the word developer like a technical

322
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,720
proficiency tied up with credibility

323
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,000
that for some reason CSS just doesn't

324
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,700
get and instead of critiquing that

325
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,850
Association like we're worrying about

326
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,300
where to draw these lines and the

327
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,230
problem again isn't that these

328
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,149
hierarchies necessarily exist but that

329
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:41,649
they subtle

330
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,160
there's the differ subtly based on the

331
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,040
company the person the job post and then

332
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,260
those reading that information are left

333
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,600
trying to infer these these categories

334
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,860
these hierarchies and because we're not

335
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,290
clear we we're not clear on the

336
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,760
hierarchies we stripped them of their

337
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,490
effectiveness if we don't come to the

338
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,170
table with a shared understanding of

339
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,170
development and how CSS is a part of it

340
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,150
we can't clearly communicate what we

341
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,190
value

342
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,530
and true hierarchies good hierarchies

343
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,400
are clear they're unambiguous and if not

344
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,830
we leave the door open for changing

345
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,570
interpretations of value and we leave

346
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,130
the door open for bias and intact this

347
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,300
automatically skews in favor of a

348
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,310
certain archetype and I'll talk more

349
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,680
about that in a minute

350
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,400
like I mentioned this might be a joke

351
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,370
right but its repetition is damaging

352
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,020
because it becomes implicit it becomes

353
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,820
an assumption that we make going in and

354
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,760
don't question anymore and to be clear

355
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,860
I'm not saying that there isn't a

356
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,560
difference between like CSS HTML

357
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,040
Javascript and languages like C like I'm

358
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,240
not saying it's not a difference

359
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,000
but what's dangerous is the power

360
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,310
dynamics and subtle implications that

361
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,680
one is harder and therefore better than

362
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,870
the other and the creation of archetypes

363
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,400
around them this becomes ingrained it

364
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,620
leads us to make bad decisions and treat

365
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,020
others poorly in some cases even when we

366
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,770
don't mean to in the same way that

367
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,850
characterization makes it easier to

368
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,370
place people in roles it also makes it

369
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,260
easier to devalue people and saying you

370
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,420
know CSS isn't really development or

371
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,700
some variant of that takes away from

372
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,040
what I think is a thriving debate around

373
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,470
where CSS is going and what it's capable

374
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,210
of you know for the more we don't talk

375
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,700
about it if I don't know how your

376
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,290
hierarchy differs from mine we'll never

377
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,590
come to any sort of consensus and this

378
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,420
is implicit but the problems manifest

379
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,590
explicitly and the developer archetype

380
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,570
and you know what he looks like

381
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,500
generally is how this implicit weird

382
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
value-based programming language

383
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,390
hierarchy intersects with a biased

384
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,189
social one this this developer male

385
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:11,130
usually sits implicitly at the top of

386
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,920
the hierarchy and yes it doesn't write

387
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,850
CSS and illustrate how this intersection

388
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,429
becomes complicated think about how it

389
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:22,829
might manifest when sort of a white male

390
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,630
quote unquote CSS developer

391
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,360
and you know a female perhaps

392
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,250
quote-unquote CSS developer of color

393
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,020
applied for the same job

394
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,730
what hierarchies are applied to those

395
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,850
people when we don't know or we aren't

396
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,010
transparent about it we reach you know

397
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,110
we reach into our subconscious for

398
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,380
things we do quote-unquote know and then

399
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,559
when that knowledge is already wrong

400
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,419
that of a particular archetype being a

401
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,210
developer and good at computer things we

402
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,980
shoot ourselves in the foot it means

403
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,909
that we compromise CSS the people who

404
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,880
use it and develop in it and we

405
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,100
compromise the industry by leaving out

406
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,230
people that can actually impact it the

407
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,590
most and furthermore if you know we're

408
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,909
sitting at that hiring table and we

409
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:11,700
don't hire any CSS developer at all

410
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,770
because we don't value CSS as a

411
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,230
development skill it impacts the web a

412
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,900
bit more so just a couple of examples

413
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,820
here and I think this point it needs

414
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,700
belaboring because it intersects with

415
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,650
how CSS perception interacts with the

416
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,970
social and prevents people who end up

417
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,799
you know lower in these hierarchies

418
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,630
through no fault of their own from

419
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,309
participating in our community and

420
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,850
contributing to CSS development and then

421
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,770
CSS development contributing to the web

422
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,880
as a whole and this is complicated

423
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,340
there's so many hierarchy here and what

424
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,460
group what we group which fruits we

425
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,620
arbitrarily assigned to sort of high and

426
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,100
low status but we just kind of accepted

427
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,570
this and we've done very little to

428
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,520
change it and beyond beyond that beyond

429
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,059
archetypes and social intersections um

430
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:07,860
whether or not CSS is defined as

431
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,260
development has impacts on how people

432
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,809
see our skill as technicians and as

433
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,110
builders of the web for example Jess

434
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,780
calm you has about twice as many

435
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,159
attendees as this conference and

436
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,710
attracts about five times the sponsor

437
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,440
support and of course a lot goes into

438
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,919
that that data but it's experience sort

439
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,780
of suggests that recruiting and

440
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,090
conference budgets related CSS are much

441
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,610
smaller compared to what's spent on

442
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,470
JavaScript so

443
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,070
you know if you develop CSS but don't

444
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,559
know amber or something equivalent or

445
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,389
are you more skilled or valuable or less

446
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:51,480
why and who says are you worth more

447
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,750
money you're more credibility when we

448
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,490
perceive people as more skilled we give

449
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,789
those people power and these power

450
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,610
dynamics are tied up with assumptions of

451
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,090
legitimacy and until now it's been the

452
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,490
assumptions of people in power people

453
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,080
with privilege that govern these

454
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,659
perceptions like we want to say that

455
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:15,330
legitimacy development legitimacy is a

456
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,789
meritocracy but it's not and we know

457
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:21,389
it's not there are implicit valid ways

458
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:24,929
to be a developer and CSS isn't yet seen

459
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:26,399
as one of them and I believe that it

460
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:32,100
should be this perception of developer

461
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,259
legitimacy is really important for

462
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:35,429
minority groups for the underrepresented

463
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:38,100
as well because these implicit

464
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,870
structures as I mentioned take power

465
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,450
away from those who should have it and

466
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,590
prevent them from contributing to

467
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,330
development to the web to the

468
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,940
experiences that we're building on it

469
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,820
and in the office context perhaps people

470
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,500
are excluded from meetings or cold

471
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,580
reviews based on perceived language

472
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,259
value and expertise and their inputs

473
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,539
lost if they were even invited to begin

474
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,750
with one path into development isn't

475
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,700
better or more deserving than another

476
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,200
and this then leads to arbitrary pay

477
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,899
scales if I think development is worth a

478
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:15,539
lot of money but CSS isn't real

479
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,210
development then stands to reason that

480
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,330
CSS isn't worth as much money and and

481
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,549
then if the person doing that CSS

482
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,200
development is a member of our minority

483
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,139
group will pay them even less this is

484
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:31,409
the problem again and if our attitudes

485
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:34,830
and language based hierarchies become

486
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,299
value-based and vary from person to

487
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,820
person this negatively impacts

488
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,009
individuals communities and the forward

489
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,379
momentum of languages and CSS especially

490
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:48,419
and this has consequences on our mental

491
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,919
health because you know when you see

492
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:50,970
someone as less valuable

493
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,380
even in something as simple as which

494
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,080
language they choose to code in you will

495
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,090
behave differently towards them and just

496
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,230
because you see it as a joke doesn't

497
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,450
mean that someone else does for example

498
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,059
a front-end designer who works with CSS

499
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,299
every day might be as I mentioned

500
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,890
excluded from a meeting on a piece of

501
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,690
critical functionality because they're

502
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,480
not a developer and this has

503
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,580
consequences for them personally

504
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,710
professionally and not to mention for

505
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,330
the product they're building or the

506
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,020
site's they're building so and that

507
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,940
brings me to you know when these

508
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,220
applications are built a devaluing of

509
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,880
CSS in fact sent to when we give this

510
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,940
value across languages we don't bring

511
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,520
all the developers that we need this is

512
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,970
also from the stack overflow survey you

513
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,960
can just see these fluctuations in

514
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,890
popularity and popularity means most

515
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,539
commonly used and there's also yeah

516
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,440
there's wanted as well so look I'm not

517
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,419
taking issue with any of this and I'm

518
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,770
really happy that Sakura for do stuff

519
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,960
like this um but should the standing of

520
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,059
a particular language here influence how

521
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,360
people see our competency probably not

522
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,929
but for CSS it does so this yesterday on

523
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:08,730
my way to on my way here actually yeah

524
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,429
no yes when we as a community devalue

525
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:14,039
CSS into Deb skill you excellent

526
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,630
performance suffer and this is true when

527
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,480
we when we devalue CSS in Deb skill when

528
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,919
we don't challenge these hierarchies the

529
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,440
web suffers as do its users and as the

530
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,150
accessible enters into its own sub

531
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,710
disciplines and specialties you know we

532
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,240
have to be aware of our own hierarchies

533
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,400
as well and how that affects our own

534
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,500
community and how we can best mitigate

535
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,490
that so what can we do then I'm not

536
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,429
suggesting that we get rid of this or

537
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:45,419
tried to get rid of this like

538
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,830
fundamental human behavior because

539
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,539
hierarchies are fine they make us feel

540
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,030
safe but they need to be transparent and

541
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,039
forceful and concrete and not based

542
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,630
across languages we should feel

543
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,120
comfortable challenging them there are

544
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,399
differences between languages but we can

545
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:00,659
identify and understand those

546
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,520
differences and usually use them to

547
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,780
bridge skill gaps and solve problems

548
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,470
so if something is implicit right we

549
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,880
can't fight it if we don't know we

550
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,770
disagree or we're afraid to admit it we

551
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,950
can't make things any better so

552
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,320
individually organizationally we can ask

553
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,600
ourselves what our hierarchies are we

554
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
can write we can write down or somehow

555
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,429
record what we perceive to be a

556
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,380
developer and don't just ask the

557
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,520
question answer it and answer it openly

558
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,960
if we're scared of people having more

559
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,429
information it's a good sign that we're

560
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:39,570
doing something wrong we can be hyper

561
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,000
aware of our own biases and hierarchies

562
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,350
and be honest with each other

563
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,659
check assumptions not just at the door

564
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,520
but throughout and call each other on

565
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,030
them write them down before we talk for

566
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,289
example in a hiring meeting what's

567
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:54,390
important to everybody in the room don't

568
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,450
we shouldn't assume that we know and if

569
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,490
the hierarchies are so obvious if CSS

570
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,780
isn't really development then it should

571
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,270
be easy to state them saying them out

572
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,200
loud makes them real it bring it

573
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,520
surfaces those assumptions that are

574
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,559
empowering legitimacy and it takes them

575
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,990
away too it makes us accountable to our

576
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,700
definitions and we can't expect people

577
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,039
who are the victims of these hierarchies

578
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,590
to drive the change so those who of

579
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,919
hiring power can get across so as the

580
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,710
skill that those would hire in Paris

581
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,960
who's we can get across to people that

582
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,360
we value the skill that they bring not

583
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,159
the language of that skill manifest in

584
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,669
if we can if we can shout about CSS as

585
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:41,970
development we can and we should focus

586
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,409
on the skill sets that people are

587
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,350
bringing to us and start you know

588
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,270
getting a handle on those complex sensor

589
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,559
intersections that I mentioned and

590
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:53,640
challenging hierarchies in a broad

591
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,720
context means putting on early groups

592
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,100
and decision making roles and

593
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,750
challenging hierarchies by deviating

594
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,539
from them in a CSS context understanding

595
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:06,090
that CSS is technical is development

596
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,830
governs function and not just

597
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,990
presentation and it should be valued

598
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,780
like the complex skill set that it is if

599
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,580
it was and even if it wasn't real

600
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,429
development before it is now so let's

601
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:19,350
talk about that let's change

602
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:23,310
and know this isn't easy this is quite I

603
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,040
know he said that I would tell you tell

604
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,900
you what you know seasons development

605
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,020
and how to fix this but I I know that we

606
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,330
need to categorize we all know this and

607
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,240
I'm not asking you not to what I am

608
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,080
proposing here is this conversation that

609
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,570
those of us who think these hierarchies

610
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,210
are so obvious actually take a good look

611
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,730
at them document them and make them open

612
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,590
you know no shouting about right or

613
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,920
wrong or anything just openness and only

614
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,210
then once we have that transparency

615
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,570
around whether whether and who believed

616
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,430
CSS is development can we drive

617
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,900
meaningful change in one direction or

618
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,940
another

619
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,560
yeah so it's not easy but so what right

620
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,820
it's fine to be uncomfortable with

621
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,940
disagreement what's not fine is allowing

622
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,590
these mr. Bester because we're avoiding

623
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,260
having our opinions challenged we don't

624
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,360
have to agree but we have to come to

625
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,370
some sort of shared understanding like

626
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,100
why is it okay to use disagreement for

627
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,990
example in in the startup world in the

628
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,540
tech world to improve CSS or any other

629
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,730
language for that matter as cold but not

630
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,260
to improve the environment to the people

631
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,650
who write it in that language in these

632
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,810
interpersonal situations is hard to

633
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,250
admit perhaps that we've hurt someone

634
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,920
else or hurt an application to the thing

635
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,990
that we were building in some way

636
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,370
especially if we're asking with good

637
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,020
intentions but it's okay to make a

638
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,770
mistake right and

639
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,750
I don't think this is optional we pride

640
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,230
ourselves on solving hard problems and

641
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,030
can solve this we can drive CSS forward

642
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,400
as development and make what we're

643
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,750
building better and make our community

644
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,260
better we could put our money where our

645
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,260
mouths are and learn from failure like

646
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,680
we say we do all the time and if we said

647
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,990
CSS isn't real development in the in the

648
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,600
past it's fine we can always change the

649
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,700
hierarchies and better understand the

650
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,280
relationships of CSS to the rest of the

651
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,550
web and for us like CSS is just it's

652
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,180
just a start

653
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,330
it is development and let's make that

654
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,660
forgiving we can if we do that or if we

655
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,270
sort of set on the path to doing that we

656
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,510
could better understand our roles we can

657
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,550
actually leverage hierarchies the way

658
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,080
we're supposed to do right better

659
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,180
understand our roles as CSS engineers

660
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,440
developers designers whatever when we

661
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,910
better know what we value and how we can

662
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,130
know where to spend all of our energies

663
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,860
and how to put together better teams how

664
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,990
to make better products and better web

665
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,560
experiences and most importantly we can

666
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,440
make sure that our community is as

667
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,720
brilliant as we know it can be both

668
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,590
technically and otherwise thank you very

669
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,620
much for having me I appreciate it all

670
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,910
right

671
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:21,690
