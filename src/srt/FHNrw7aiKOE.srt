00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,619
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,619
My name is Michele with one L.

3
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:26,160
This is my talk "It takes a village to make
a programmer".

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,000
It's a talk in 2 parts.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,500
The first part is my story and the second
part is a bunch of suggestions for you, for

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,300
how you can help in your own village.

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,970
To start my story...

8
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,879
I went to school for teaching and I unfortunately
graduated at the height of the recession in

9
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,120
the United States.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,609
So I ended up not getting a teaching job and
I was just substitute teaching, which I think

11
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:55,210
is the most demoralizing job in the world.

12
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,989
I was really unhappy for awhile.

13
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,820
I realized I would have to move to get a job
and I thought: if I'm going to move away for

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,890
a job, I'm going to move far, far away.

15
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,540
After 2 years of substitute teaching, I moved
to Germany.

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:18,220
When I got here, I got a random office job
that wasn't going to be permanent.

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,740
I realized I had a big decision to make.

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,479
There were lots of different directions my
professional career could go.

19
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,060
I had thrown around the idea of maybe becoming
a UX designer.

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,800
I could teach English as a foreign language.

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,929
I could try to go back to teaching.

22
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:37,860
I could keep this office job if I really wanted
to.

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,700
Or I could do something totally different.

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,530
So, one day at my office job -- I was an office
manager for a tour operator for people who

25
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,050
went on cruises -- we got a bill from our
programmers.

26
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,770
The bill was really outrageous.

27
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:00,080
It was for this really simple customer feedback
form that we asked them to create for us.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,550
I had written back and forth to them about
10 times with all these little things that

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,380
they could have done to make it better.

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,910
I was taking German courses at the time and
afterwards I had gone out with my classmates.

31
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,600
I was so angry and so upset about this, I
was raving to them about how I could do it

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
better...

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,930
I should be a programmer...

34
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,800
I could do this...

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,069
I didn't take myself very seriously, but one
of my classmates did.

36
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:33,909
She emailed me about a course that was going
to be offered in Berlin called "Front-end

37
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:37,599
web development for beginners".

38
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,150
It was really expensive, so I sent an email
to my brother saying "Hey, there's this course.

39
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,640
Wanna sponsor me?

40
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
LOL"

41
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,349
I got the loving response from him of: nothing.

42
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,760
I wrote to him a second time, "No, seriously.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,269
What do you think?

44
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,569
Will you help me out?"

45
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:59,349
He said yes, so I took the course.

46
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:04,499
Halfway through the course, one of the people
working for General Assembly -- the company

47
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:09,150
where I took it -- was also running a group
here in Berlin called "Berlin Geekettes".

48
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,589
I found out they were offering a hackathon.

49
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:19,040
So after 6 weeks with just knowledge of HTML
and CSS, I participated in my first hackathon.

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,900
This was where I had my "Holy.

51
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,459
Shit." moment.

52
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,959
I was like, "Oh my god!"

53
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,739
The energy that you could feel in the room,
when everybody was just getting together and

54
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,739
hashing out their ideas and forming teams
and working together...

55
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,380
The energy was electric.

56
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,079
I looked around and I just saw amazing things
happening.

57
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,620
People were taking ideas that just existed
inside of their own head, and using nothing

58
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,650
but their computer and their hands and people
around them they were taking this idea and

59
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,829
making it into something that other people
could do and use and interact with.

60
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,779
I thought that was amazing.

61
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:58,060
I thought: I want to do that and I want to
do that and I want to do that.

62
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,519
I want to be able to do everything.

63
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,510
I ended up quitting my office job.

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,500
I finally realized what I wanted to do.

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,530
And I thought, OK I am going to do it.

66
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,969
Berlin is the city where you can take some
time off and afford it, so I decided to do

67
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:17,639
this.

68
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,889
I had a lot of free time on my hands once
I was unemployed and I heard about a conference

69
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,140
called Eurocamp.

70
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,340
It's a Ruby conference that happens here in
Berlin.

71
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,560
I'd never heard about anything like a tech
conference before.

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,250
It was never something really on my radar.

73
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,710
I thought, cool, an event where everybody
is interested in the same thing and they go

74
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,120
there and hang out?

75
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,590
I want to go!

76
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,870
A couple of people I knew had gotten tickets
through Rails Girls.

77
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,819
They'd gotten them for free through a diversity
outreach program.

78
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,650
But there were no tickets left.

79
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,840
I couldn't afford go myself, being unemployed.

80
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,520
They said "follow the Twitter account and
maybe somebody will sell theirs for free,

81
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,710
or get rid of it for a cheap price!"

82
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,490
I started following the account and I saw
this guy, Bruno and he tweeted: So, I have

83
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,560
my Eurocamp ticket and unfortunately I can't
go.

84
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,590
Let's make it count.

85
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,250
Give me a good reason and it's free.

86
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,480
#givesomethingback

87
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,810
I tweeted at him right away and I wasn't sure
if I could get the ticket -- I didn't know

88
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,080
what other people I was competing with and
what reasons they had -- but I said: I'm really

89
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,580
passionate, please give me a chance.

90
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,419
And I did get the ticket.

91
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,830
I got the ticket with several stipulations.

92
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,949
He said: OK, you can have the ticket, but
I have three rules.

93
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,199
Number 1: You have to have fun.

94
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,300
You have to have a lot of fun.

95
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,340
I said I can do that.

96
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,862
Number 2: Find my friend Justine, she is giving
a talk, give her a hug.

97
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:47,970
I said I can do that, too.

98
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,520
Number 3: I don't care what you do, what it
is.

99
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,590
Somehow you need to give back to the community.

100
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,740
I said: OK, I can do that.

101
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,440
So that's part of what I'm here doing today:
hoping that I can inspire you to give back

102
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,950
to your communities as well.

103
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:09,070
I went to the conference and it was way more
impactful in my life than I ever could have

104
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,070
imagined.

105
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:16,669
It was where I took my first Rails Girls workshop
and I decided I did not want to start programming

106
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:19,139
by learning Rails.

107
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,379
One of the girls I attended with went on to
become one of my best friends.

108
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:27,960
I was exposed to the idea of lightning talks
for the first time and that was the first

109
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,389
time I thought to myself: maybe I can be a
speaker too.

110
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:32,389
Five minutes?

111
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:34,550
I can do that!

112
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:40,039
Probably the most important thing was this
talk that was given at the Rails Girls workshop

113
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:45,470
by another woman who had changed careers one
year after her first Rails Girls workshop.

114
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't remember a single thing about her
talk, because I just sat there the whole time

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,740
after she had been introduced, thinking to
myself: I'm going to do that, and I'm going

116
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,310
to do it faster and I'm going to do it better.

117
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,699
Since then, she has actually seen me give
this talk and we have spoken about it.

118
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,160
She is cool with it, because you want your
talk to impact people and how effective is

119
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,350
your talk if you don't even have to give it
for it to have such a profound inspiration?

120
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:20,039
So, I attended this wonderful conference and
was back to my unemployed life.

121
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,280
I had 5 really good days.

122
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,539
5 great days where I was working from the
moment I woke up until a reasonable hour in

123
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:30,539
the evening.

124
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:36,539
Keeping track of what I was doing, how much
time I spent learning each thing...

125
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,320
It was really productive first week.

126
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,780
After that everything went downhill.

127
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,470
I don't know how much you have tried to do
completely on your own, but it is not easy.

128
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,530
After that it became a big struggle.

129
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,840
Luckily at the same time I met another guy,
named Franks, who also quit his job.

130
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,990
We had these really symbiotic interests, where
he was interested in learning more about teaching,

131
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,110
I was interested in learning more about programming
and those were both our respective careers,

132
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,969
so we teamed up.

133
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:11,770
He became a real huge mentor for me.

134
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,400
He would hang out with me and pair program.

135
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,271
He would whip up a gist and explain a concept
if I was getting trouble getting it and we

136
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:21,039
weren't together.

137
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,389
He wrote homework assignments for me.

138
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:27,740
He really pushed my learning forward and helped
me to have somebody to rely on.

139
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,900
Somebody I could trust and ask questions and
help me improve and expand my knowledge.

140
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:41,760
Soon after this -- because relying on Franks
wouldn't have been enough -- I found about

141
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,180
a program that was being piloted in Berlin
called Hackership.

142
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,690
It's based on the Hackerschool in New York,
if you're familiar with that.

143
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:57,940
It is a full time learning program for programmers
of all levels of experience.

144
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:05,410
Basically, what you do is come together full
time and just working on learning whatever

145
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,889
you are interested in.

146
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:13,990
Not only do you have mentors provided for
you, but you're working alongside other people,

147
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,470
so it's like a real academic setting.

148
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,880
It helps you have somewhere to go and you
get to put on workshops yourself.

149
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,209
One of the best parts was, at the end of every
week we had to give presentations to the whole

150
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:32,720
group, so I got to practice my public speaking
and got to share what I was working on during

151
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,480
these six weeks, which was a web application
that I was building in Ruby without any frameworks

152
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,070
or any libraries except for the crypto stuff.

153
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,410
The thing I was most proud of was the user
authentication system I wrote.

154
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,120
That was really cool.

155
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,190
That was for 6 weeks and that really pushed
my learning forward.

156
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,320
Just to recap on the timeline of the situation....

157
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,890
January 22, 2013 -- last year -- that was
when I wrote my first "Hello world" at this

158
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,700
front-end web development course.

159
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:15,560
And January 21st of this year -- 2014 -- I
got not one, but two junior developer job

160
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,840
offers.

161
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,510
Once I finally got over the fear of looking
for a job.

162
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,980
(applause)

163
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,529
So, some really exciting news.

164
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,950
I work for Sociomantic.

165
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:37,040
The team I started on was doing the CSS for
ad banners.

166
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,160
So I have been doing CSS exclusively for the
last six months, but I just found out this

167
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:49,810
week I got accepted to a new team where I
will be doing native JavaScript.

168
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,630
(applause)

169
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,320
I got this job offer and I accepted it but
because of some legal issues I had to wait

170
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,699
about a month-and-a-half before I could start
working.

171
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:07,380
Again I had some more free time, so I decided
to apply to speak at my first conferences.

172
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,060
I got accepted to speak at my first conference.

173
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,030
It was another Ruby conference in Uruguay.

174
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,279
Uruguay is pretty far away from Berlin.

175
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,250
Something happens when you are unemployed
for seven months.

176
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,220
You run out of money.

177
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,170
So I got accepted to speak at this conference,
I was invited to go, but I had no way to get

178
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,170
there.

179
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,480
At the urging of the conference organizers,
I setup an Indiegogo and again the community

180
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,889
overwhelmed me with their support.

181
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:43,070
In 24 hours I made all the money I needed
to cover the flight and somewhere to stay.

182
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,010
Just out of the generosity of people's hearts.

183
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,100
Most people didn't know me at all.

184
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,090
They just read the little description of this
talk I'm giving now.

185
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,779
I have to thank a couple of people as one
of the rewards.

186
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:03,080
Thank you to Bruno, Denis, Dafydd, Seth, Sven,
along with a dozen other people who helped

187
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,250
me to get there.

188
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,830
(applause)

189
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,720
So thank you to them.

190
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,460
As I have said, the community has done so
much for me and so much to help me to get

191
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,850
to where I am today, that now I would like
to give you some suggestions for how you can

192
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,149
help in your own community.

193
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:32,949
I'm going to go through a list of suggestions
with some different resources, based on what

194
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:34,820
resources you have.

195
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,790
I hope there is something for everybody here.

196
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,350
This is how to help in your own village.

197
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,480
If you have a little bit of time, just a little
bit, there are still things you can do.

198
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,620
The first thing is, you can give encouragement.

199
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,860
It's such a simple thing, but it can have
such a huge impact.

200
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:59,250
I can't tell you how many days I was learning
programming and I would get stuck on a concept.

201
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,339
It would not click in my head and I'd think:
What are you doing?

202
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:05,680
Are you crazy?

203
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,880
You should go back to doing something else
because you're never going to figure this

204
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
out.

205
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,009
It's never going to work out.

206
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:19,110
And then, inevitably, living in an international
city like Berlin I would meet somebody and

207
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,920
they would say: what are you doing in Berlin?

208
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,529
And I'd be like: oh, I'm changing careers,
I'm learning how to program.

209
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,600
And they'be like: no way, that is so awesome!

210
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,810
I'd be like, oh... yeah, it kind of is awesome,
I'm following my dreams!

211
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,449
It would just jolt me back.

212
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:43,360
I have a real reason I'm doing this and I
do belong in programming.

213
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,920
Something simple as "hey, that's really cool"
can really make somebody's day.

214
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,670
Something else you can do with a little bit
of time is expose your passions.

215
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,949
I want you to take to Twitter, take to a blog,
a meetup, start speaking about whatever you're

216
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:01,949
interested in.

217
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:09,550
Everybody in this room has something they're
interested in that is unique, but you don't

218
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,639
know who else shares this unique interest
of yours if you don't talk about it and you

219
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,050
don't share it.

220
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,199
Especially consider ways you can be inviting,
to talk people who might not have as much

221
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,540
knowledge about this as you do.

222
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,990
Think of ways to get other people involved.

223
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:34,360
If you have a little bit of time or a lot
of time, there are some options for you...

224
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,640
Quality beginner-friendly resources.

225
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,970
There are 2 parts to this.

226
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,450
The first is, just sharing them.

227
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,940
If you only have a little bit of time you
can find quality resources and share them

228
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,279
by tweeting them or just telling people about
them.

229
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,970
Or if you have even more time, maybe you can
write some yourself.

230
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,290
Because as you know, there is such a wealth
of resources out there and they are not all

231
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,910
created equal.

232
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:05,910
You can Google how to do something and find
25 different blog articles and you know that

233
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,300
some of these are crap and some are good.

234
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,980
But you don't know, if you are inexperienced.

235
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:21,100
If you have any sort of motivation to write
some of these things, please do it.

236
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,430
Maybe you don't have time, but you have money?

237
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,009
You can be a sponsor.

238
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:33,110
It is so easy to have so many excuses why
you don't want to try something new or get

239
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,580
into a new field or get started.

240
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,180
You can talk people out of a lot of excuses,
but you can't talk someone out of not having

241
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,759
enough money.

242
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:49,389
You could sponsor someone for a course or
workshop -- like my brother did for me -- or

243
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:53,779
some other creative way to use the resources
that you have.

244
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,490
You can also send somebody to a conference.

245
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:02,779
As we said before a conference is so much
more than just talks and professional development.

246
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:08,440
There is networking, you meet friends, there
can be workshops.

247
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,440
You just get so much more from a conference
than you can imagine.

248
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,670
It can be a really great place, but as you
know, they can be really expensive.

249
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:23,370
If you have some way to get an extra ticket
or if you're an organizer: JSConf did a really

250
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,959
great job with these diversity tickets where
you could buy one and send someone else with

251
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,060
it.

252
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,139
Something like that is really awesome.

253
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:38,899
If you have a lot of time, you should become
a mentor.

254
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:42,810
This is the single most important thing that
you can do for anyone who is starting out

255
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,570
or changing careers.

256
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,500
It is the biggest thing you can do to help
someone.

257
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,260
If you have somebody to trust and somebody
you can ask these questions to and you can

258
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,160
share your experiences with.

259
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,410
There are so many different ways you can do
this.

260
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,010
It doesn't have to mean just one thing.

261
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,459
You could meet for lunch as often as monthly,
or weekly.

262
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:05,110
Whatever you can commit to.

263
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,949
You could pair program with people.

264
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,980
You could simply offer advice by email.

265
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,250
In the last year, I found out about this program
called mentoring.is.

266
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,770
It is a distributed mentoring movement.

267
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:25,980
You add /mentoring to your personal website,
and they give you a text that you can use

268
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,790
to just say to people, "Hey, I'm open to being
a mentor.

269
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,210
This is how to get in touch with me."

270
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,840
It is a really great way if you don't know
how to get started or how to get involved

271
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
in your community.

272
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,010
You can simply add this and start sharing
it.

273
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,620
If you have space and time.

274
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,809
There are more options.

275
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,960
We need you to create safe spaces.

276
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,169
What do I mean by that?

277
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:56,270
Safe spaces can be anything: a hackathon,
a workshop, a study group.

278
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,260
It could mean a women-only group.

279
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,299
Or some sort of minority-only group.

280
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,350
I want to make a point about this.

281
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,470
There seems to be some controversy, where
people think that these whatever-only spaces

282
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,669
are exclusive.

283
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,200
They're not.

284
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,030
They're actually inclusive.

285
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,820
They include people who otherwise would have
been excluded.

286
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:23,320
Whether they would have felt uncomfortable,
or unsafe or couldn't get in due to overcrowding.

287
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,570
Whatever reason it is, it includes more people
who otherwise wouldn't have been included.

288
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,400
Why are safe spaces important?

289
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,980
They are really important because this is
where you challenge yourself and take risks

290
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,980
and stretch your limits.

291
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,380
You can't find out what new things you can
do if you don't feel comfortable enough to

292
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,880
try new things.

293
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,960
That's why safe spaces are so important...
for us to have these community spaces.

294
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,250
Finally, if you have courage, I urge you to
tell your story.

295
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:00,000
Especially if you have a story that doesn't
fit the mold of the stereotypical kid who

296
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,350
started programming when he could write and
has been doing it his entire life.

297
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,450
I have a quote for you from a documentary
called Misrepresentation.

298
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:14,059
It says: you cannot be what you cannot see.

299
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,550
Of course there are exceptions.

300
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:22,350
But if you can be a role model or a hero for
somebody... where they can identify with something

301
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:29,390
in you, and if you are a little bit different
than other people, that can be a really amazing

302
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:34,440
way to help out by just becoming a figure
for people.

303
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,960
So, what now?

304
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,360
I'd like to take one moment to give a shout-out
to hard work and to acknowledge the hard work

305
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
that I did put in.

306
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,130
And that other people like me have put in.

307
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,410
Because even with all the help in the world
it wouldn't have been possible, and I think

308
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,810
it is important to acknowledge.

309
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,780
I also have one more quote for you.

310
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,500
It is by Tal Ben-Shahar, who is a positive
psychologist from Harvard.

311
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,860
He says: there is so much benefit to the person
who contributes to others that I often think

312
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,179
that there is no more selfish act than a generous
act.

313
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:16,250
So that means anything you do for other people,
you're really doing for yourself.

314
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,640
Any of these ways that you can help out, you
will feel a reward.

315
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,890
And it will feel good.

316
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,610
I can promise you that.

317
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:33,760
So, now I would like you to please return
to your villages and make some programmers!

318
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,920
(applause)

319
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:49,240
Thank you.

320
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:59,560


321
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,990
I have some resources for you.

322
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,500
I will tweet it out later.

323
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,370
It has different things.

324
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:10,809
What I used to learn programming, mentoring
and diversity groups, if you are interested

325
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:14,780
in learning how to diversify more in your
own company.

326
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,510
And some different coding groups for kids.
