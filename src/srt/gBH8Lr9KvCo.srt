1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:21,400

you

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,529


3
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,189
hello everyone my name is Joel dart as

4
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,099
Jed said I come from a live and work in

5
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,690
indianapolis indiana in the united

6
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,449
states i work for a company called dino

7
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:38,360
where we do real-time classroom software

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,530
but tonight i'm going to talk about

9
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:48,629
people the good parts in javascript the

10
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,579
good parts Papa crockford as he is

11
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,199
affectionately called said the

12
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,969
JavaScript has an elegant core that

13
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,589
shines through despite his share of bad

14
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,769
parts he used the book to introduce a

15
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:01,259
new generation to this to the virtues of

16
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:03,479
this elegant core and to introduce a

17
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,960
tool called jslint where a tool designed

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,390
to shine a developer's attention

19
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,070
immediately on areas of the code that

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,890
either will cause problems or could in

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,430
time now entire talks have been devoted

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,500
to the good parts and the book's author

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,200
and jas lent but I wanted to highlight

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,149
what I find it be an interesting theme

25
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:26,850
in all of this one of the good parts

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,220
that we all know love is prototypal

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,850
inheritance here we're not able to only

28
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,470
define the features and functionality of

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,080
our objects but also to extend existing

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,090
objects by adding to their prototype

31
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,010
this has been used to extend the

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,320
language and to prototype out language

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,570
features and back port them into two

34
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,090
older browsers it also serves as the

35
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,729
basis for the very popular extends

36
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,650
pattern that we see in a lot of our

37
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,299
favorite frameworks here you can take

38
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,729
the properties and methods of one object

39
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,869
and put them directly on another object

40
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,670
allowing for very powerful and simple

41
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,239
means of multiple inheritance because

42
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,790
you can take something that exists

43
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,129
something that's complete in itself and

44
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:20,730
extend it to new heights this idea of

45
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,879
extension has has been embraced and

46
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,680
complemented by the web development

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,610
concept of progressive enhancement as

48
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,159
you know here we take we try to provide

49
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,260
a complete user experience in HTML alone

50
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,639
and then provide incremental

51
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,530
improvements to that UX

52
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,069
using CSS and finally JavaScript we take

53
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,620
something complete in itself and extend

54
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,060
it to new heights but the web

55
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,500
development community didn't create

56
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,290
progressive enhancement in fact in the

57
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,560
1920s film theorist and director Sergei

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,420
Eisenstein discussed a theory of montage

59
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,850
where you would take one complete scene

60
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,950
or or or image and a second complete

61
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,459
scene or image and through juxtaposition

62
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:20,880
Express a third new idea but even before

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,680
that the great minds of ancient Greece

64
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,620
such as Pythagoras discussed a system of

65
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,700
music based on 12 tones and tetra chords

66
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,830
but they were not content only to pluck

67
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,860
the liar so much so in fact they had is

68
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,290
a different system of musical notation

69
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,540
for when the music was set against the

70
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,230
text now I don't speak Greek but I'm

71
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:51,870
told that the I'm told that the music

72
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:59,480
itself and the the notation is let me

73
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:20,750
real quick change this

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,960
better it's not any better but it's okay

75
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:34,950
apologize for this not only that the

76
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,160
rhythms itself are inspired by the

77
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,210
language itself to the point of the

78
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,160
stresses in the natural stresses in the

79
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,130
language are found out the notation so

80
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,840
they took that it was very clear because

81
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,090
of this they intended to take something

82
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,240
complete in itself the text and extend

83
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,550
it to new heights my art project poetry

84
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,380
Jas means to take to continue in this

85
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,150
tradition of progressive enhancement

86
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,050
this human tradition of extension first

87
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:34,070
I take a text this is not

88
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:49,250
did I just break the projector

89
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,910
okay okay sorry about that once again

90
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:01,950
now we've got the full screen all right

91
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,560
so I take it I take the text such as

92
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,630
this one here that has its own theme and

93
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,420
tone control is power and I am in

94
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,740
control of my life this text itself is

95
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,440
comes from somebody who's very confident

96
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,200
I like to think of like an Alec Baldwin

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,080
Gordon Gekko salesy type of guy he's

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,730
worked very hard in his life and he's

99
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,290
accomplished a lot of things and

100
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,240
probably worked maybe a little harder

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,070
than those around him and because of

102
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,740
that he has it feels a deep sense of

103
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,750
pride about those outcomes but now that

104
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,280
I've got the text i extend it with

105
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,980
JavaScript semantics syntax and runtime

106
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,460
and here we can see the situation is

107
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,380
much more complicated than the narrator

108
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,580
originally thought now this has a happy

109
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,730
ending or at least a non crashing one as

110
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,380
happy and ending as boring code could be

111
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,300
but a seasoned JavaScript developer is

112
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,980
going to immediately recognize all the

113
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,570
implied Global's that are created and

114
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,980
the instability that adds to the program

115
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,240
additionally if you look a little closer

116
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,160
you can see one of the textbook examples

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,080
of unexpected results from type coercion

118
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,870
what looks to be a very simple and

119
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,660
obvious path forward has an unbelievable

120
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,900
number of hidden powers at work and this

121
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,020
brings me to my first bad part of people

122
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,480
narrow vision we especially in the

123
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,890
development community are very

124
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,690
intelligent people aware of a broad

125
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,260
range of subjects and especially and

126
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,330
we're also of even dangerous social

127
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,170
vices such as pride but for all our

128
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,510
wisdom we only know what we see just

129
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,910
like we wrote imply Global's before we

130
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,370
were taught in PI Global's so we're

131
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,650
arrogant we're overconfident but we are

132
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,750
not alone our vision is weak but it's

133
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,160
supplemented by those who see what we

134
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,030
cannot see now no one likes to be called

135
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,500
but the wounds of a friend can be

136
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:15,290
trusted even if it hurts your feelings

137
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,340
the second poem was actually my first

138
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,250
and probably still my favorite it reads

139
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,120
functionality zoom in a little bit

140
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,030
functionality variation one I know my

141
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,539
fate is undefined hate destroys file

142
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,349
betrayals to regret heart I pray the

143
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,200
vile betrayals are few but dare I while

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,600
I take continue healing Lord for this I

145
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,029
know and heart does break what vile

146
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,640
betrayals are my fate I pray the Lord my

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,160
soul to take I dare you not to take my

148
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:02,720
hate it's

149
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,420
it's a little emo it has a dark side to

150
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,079
it the the main narrator has a sense of

151
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,899
regret about themselves and who they are

152
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:16,930
and what they've done to people similar

153
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,880
to the nine inch nails song hurt or the

154
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,079
Johnny Cash cover if that's more your

155
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,490
scene but still there's a defiant

156
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,760
resistance to change the reasons aren't

157
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,550
clear but there's something that gets in

158
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,540
the way of making things right now when

159
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,470
we look at this at the poem I have a

160
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,410
little fun with the function turning

161
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,450
that into functionality and then VAR

162
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,110
into variation and then when we get back

163
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,019
to the text itself we can see I make a

164
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,149
literary allusion I pray the Lord my

165
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,339
soul to take from the children's nursery

166
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:57,190
rhyme now I lay me I bring this in for

167
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,720
some cultural critique but also to

168
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,540
introduce the concept of a savior but

169
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,060
this isn't a redemption story as the

170
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:10,720
code itself reveals now into this code

171
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,760
is basically broken up into due to two

172
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,130
parts the first part is exceptionally

173
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,680
boring just establishing variables and

174
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,199
walking through the code but the second

175
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,600
part actually something interesting

176
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,040
happens we get ourselves into an

177
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,380
infinite loop one of the worst possible

178
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,560
error state so we can be in this has

179
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,600
additional interest because of the way

180
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,000
that the the runtime interacts with the

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,040
text below it as we're in this infinite

182
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,260
loop were stuck constantly approaching

183
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,089
healing and never able to achieve it so

184
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,980
why do we get in this infinite loop well

185
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,019
because of the truthiness of I take I is

186
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:52,329
just a config object passed into the

187
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:55,570
function but dare and which is called at

188
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,620
the bottom but dere is basically just

189
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,050
passes through the properties from the

190
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,750
my variable which is defined up at the

191
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,660
top as a simple object literal with to

192
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,390
own properties fate which is undefined

193
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,400
and hate which is a string

194
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,180
choice so we're in this infinite loop

195
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,000
because of the existence of the own

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,260
property hate but what's interesting

197
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,070
about that own property is that its

198
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,260
shadows the clean prototype underneath

199
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,280
it if we were to have a simple delete

200
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,500
statement before calling but there then

201
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,220
the prototype would shine through and we

202
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,070
would never be in this situation but the

203
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,050
program is written there is no delete

204
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,330
and we're stuck looping forever but

205
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,640
looking back to this relationship

206
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,330
there's something about this

207
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,920
relationship between owned properties

208
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,110
and prototypes the prototype is the

209
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,200
Platonic ideal and the own properties as

210
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,910
the things that get in the way of who we

211
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,370
can really be the things we have to let

212
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,380
go this next poem is called art and fear

213
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,020
it goes when it happens when it happens

214
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,550
who sees what this program does all

215
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:22,120
together now it does nothing we see we

216
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,590
can't help but see the infinite

217
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,350
recursion and the payroll to any person

218
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,170
who dares call this code but the reality

219
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,260
the reality of it is as ominous as this

220
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,710
code is it's harmless the program is

221
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:44,889
written

222
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,100
imposter syndrome is surprisingly

223
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,600
rampant in our community if they only

224
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,509
knew how little I know they'd fire me on

225
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:58,499
the spot right but um this this is

226
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:00,149
titled art and fear because of a book

227
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:02,819
with the same title about the troubles

228
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:04,319
and identity issues in the art community

229
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:06,480
it's very useful for an artist but I

230
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,040
recommend it for programmers as well in

231
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,709
the book one of the interesting

232
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:13,079
observations the author is that how odd

233
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,290
it is that an artist can make art and

234
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,709
still doubt themselves as an artist if

235
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:22,379
we were to watch this code in Internet

236
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:23,730
Explorer 10 and I believe some other

237
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,939
engines as well we see another

238
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,990
interesting output because ie10 has an

239
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,319
interesting runtime complement I'm

240
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,670
optimization called delayed compilation

241
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,850
whereby programs aren't even functions

242
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,110
aren't even compiled until their first

243
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,350
indication which means not only does

244
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,139
this this code not matter enough to

245
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,410
devote execution cycles it doesn't even

246
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,470
turn it into machine code what an

247
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,420
amazing optimization to see things for

248
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:02,999
how they really are but still with with

249
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:05,399
the truth out there why is it that we

250
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,649
let fear get be one of the things that

251
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,480
prevents us from being who we can really

252
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,029
be and the problem with impostor

253
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,370
syndrome is that to beat it you have to

254
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,639
convince yourself that you're wrong

255
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,519
which brings me to my next bad part

256
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,800
we're obstinate we don't like change

257
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,550
even when we know know what to do is not

258
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,199
only the bullheaded rope from the first

259
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,300
poem variation one sometimes it's the

260
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,970
more vulnerable impostor syndrome but in

261
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,999
either case we don't like to make

262
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:42,319
changes on our own we need others to

263
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:45,290
encourage us and to hold us accountable

264
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,569
by all means be the change you want to

265
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:51,389
see in the world but think back the

266
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,860
reading the main reason why people

267
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,870
volunteer is because someone asked them

268
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:06,680
to

269
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,910
that's right forgot to zoom in all right

270
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,530
this last this last work that I wanted

271
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,820
to share with you is the children's

272
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
story that I wrote named little coder

273
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,050
when I decided I wanted to write a

274
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,640
children's story I knew it needed to be

275
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,220
exciting so I decided to highlight the

276
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,840
most heroic of JavaScript language

277
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,970
features hoisting honestly when you see

278
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,320
some code and reading through it like oh

279
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,360
no this isn't going to work and then it

280
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,240
totally does because of hoisting it to

281
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,610
me at least it feels like it swoops in

282
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,400
there at the last moment to save the day

283
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,930
that's excitement that's adventure

284
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:50,010
that's worsening so here's the poem yes

285
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,660
hoisting for all now the poem itself is

286
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,920
wrapped in and they feel like most of

287
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,410
our programs are we're here I'm able to

288
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,060
pass a special message to my daughter

289
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,970
disguised as the dedication / the end

290
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,810
structure and then after that it's built

291
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,720
in three paragraphs and a dangerous

292
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,660
forest of hoisted variables and I played

293
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,890
with the white space a little to give it

294
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,600
this uneasy cramped feeling as you're

295
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,840
walking down the path so with that it

296
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,690
reads little coder on your way much

297
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,910
advice will people say for performance

298
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,880
team work or to make more clear don't

299
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,670
let your imagination gray and all this

300
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,560
advice is truly good though it's often

301
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,750
misunderstood for all that comes out of

302
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,500
love deserves respect as it should but

303
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,860
you must fight avoid a yawn statements

304
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,690
to build function on must state the

305
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,270
truth that lives in you before the you

306
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,010
in here is gone so when we take a look

307
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,070
at the Hat the poem itself first thing I

308
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,680
do is make a cultural illusion up here

309
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,500
in for performance where you can see the

310
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,520
very first piece of JavaScript

311
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,410
performance advice you ever received to

312
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,620
cash your your length in your variables

313
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,220
or in a for loop then additionally later

314
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,949
on there's some word painting with you

315
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:14,189
and here and then above that comes out

316
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,679
of love as love kind of bubbles out of

317
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,260
itself but other than that and the

318
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,449
hoisting this is

319
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:22,159
really much more about the message

320
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,860
itself which is good because I feel that

321
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,829
it's kind of an important message in the

322
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,340
poem it's her in the in the story it's

323
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,019
basically some advice you would give up

324
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,380
to a programmer who's starting out to

325
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,370
that there's going to be all this advice

326
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,350
and you need to take it and respect it

327
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,330
but in the end you have to choose your

328
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,330
own path but in this I believe that

329
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,620
there's a relatively controversial

330
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,880
challenge a judgement went if you will

331
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,350
to take all the advice you're given and

332
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,820
try to find the author's love in it see

333
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
you can call jslint paternalistic and it

334
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,580
is paternalistic but he wrote it because

335
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,409
he honestly wanted to help people avoid

336
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:05,929
the pain from those errors and the same

337
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:07,610
thing goes for those who rail against

338
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,350
paternalism they want people to be able

339
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,360
to make their own choices and their own

340
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,580
trade-offs and to not lose the power in

341
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,250
the language amber people feel that a

342
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,380
really curated happy path is going to

343
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,149
make web development easier micro

344
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:21,679
library feel that choice is what makes

345
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,600
web development easier they're putting

346
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,190
their opinions out there because they

347
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,460
care so respect right you can find your

348
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,169
own path and still respect those who

349
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:33,470
pointed you in a different direction but

350
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,029
these different directions should also

351
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:37,820
be celebrated diversity of thought and

352
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,860
newly explored avenues have stretched

353
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,039
the boundaries of humanity we create and

354
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,779
we reinvent and we disagree but the

355
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:48,529
pursuit benefits us all the commons we

356
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,389
enjoy today are built off of those

357
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:53,570
creating the commons before us the other

358
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,760
really interesting and defining feature

359
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,559
of hoisting is the inherent rising

360
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,169
motion we have so many heroes in the

361
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:02,830
JavaScript community some provide ideas

362
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,070
others energy and time organizing others

363
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,309
code but we all rise with their tide so

364
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,840
my question to you is do you see the

365
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,179
good parts java script was written with

366
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:20,120
a really tiny standard library no string

367
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,720
interpolation or extends or or contains

368
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,409
no array insert or map and as we've

369
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:29,899
discussed we ourselves are also pretty

370
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:33,470
limited lacking in vision in

371
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,990
in humility and I'm pretty sure we all

372
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,940
have our own special missing radix

373
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,090
feature so where are these good parts

374
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,950
well despite its standard library java

375
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,150
script was written to be incredibly

376
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,100
extensible to allow the community to

377
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,530
fill in the rest and from that the

378
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,059
communities extended it to Heights I

379
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,610
don't think any of us had dreamed and

380
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,750
one of the defining features of our

381
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,820
primate tribe is the fact that we have

382
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,039
tribes we've seen not only that there is

383
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,260
safety in numbers but in our language

384
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,030
our art all our best ideas from

385
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,860
democracy to open source to the Internet

386
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,929
they all seem to echo the redemption

387
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:10,580
story that I am NOT the best person I

388
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,490
can be on my best day but when I'm

389
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,960
extended and so if I have one parting

390
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,080
challenge for you it's to always be

391
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,789
looking for the good parts in others

392
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,159
allow yourself to be hoisted by the best

393
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,260
in your neighbors and try to mix end

394
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,330
when you can when I look back at what

395
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,760
what attracted me to this language I

396
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,530
always joke that it was the unicorns and

397
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,250
pirates that sold me but here is a

398
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:52,580
community thank

399
00:20:52,590 --> 00:21:03,980
you
