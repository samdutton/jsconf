00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,180

good morning everyone assu said my name

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,160
is Jory person and I am the chief

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,420
operating officer of Baku that's uh I

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,279
think probably the best job in the whole

5
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,279
wide world second to maybe open web

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,070
engineer at beaucoup and that's only

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,079
because maybe somebody maybe you don't

8
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,450
know exactly what a COO does and

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,800
practically speaking it means I do

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,739
really important things like approved

11
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,250
book whose sticker budget laughs at Adam

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,520
Sontag's puns I pick up after Rick's

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,130
robots as I did yesterday and go to

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,620
really important business meetings like

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,750
that of the beaucoup diorama club it

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,970
also means that I run an open-source

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,800
software company and which entails

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,110
thinking a lot about how to operate

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,659
beaucoup so that it operates in service

20
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,970
of our mission which is to move the open

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,030
web forward that's kind of an abstract

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,150
idea though so to do this part of my job

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,820
I ask a lot of operational questions

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,190
which is some essentially boiled down to

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,430
the same three themes do we have an

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,070
objective or goal identified to execute

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,250
in service of our mission I asked what

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,070
combinations of teams people projects

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,530
resources that sort of thing we need in

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,229
order to reach our goal and I asked

31
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,510
probably the most important question how

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,409
do those entities exchange information

33
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,510
in order to create change and generate

34
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,560
volume and my bet is that you're part of

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,540
some open source project or some

36
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,310
organization where you wear and you

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,170
probably ask yourself very similar

38
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,560
questions you ask things like what are

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,880
the big picture goals you want to reach

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,400
and what milestones might you need to

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,760
create and hit in order to meet them

42
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,990
maybe you're asking what some of the

43
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,310
dependencies are that you'll need to

44
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,470
manage or major issues you'll need to

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,530
close first or what your code review

46
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,810
process should look like or how you

47
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,670
might handle issue tracking or merging

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,390
PRS as our projects and goals get bigger

49
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,580
those operational questions get

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,600
increasingly difficult to answer

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,700
problems that were once really easy to

52
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,560
solve on a small scale become

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,900
exponentially more difficult and also a

54
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,200
little bit more abstract we start asking

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,330
questions like how do we get more

56
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,730
collaborators on our projects how do we

57
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,340
get more users how do we pay for servers

58
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,100
how do we allocate our time commitments

59
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,260
to maybe work and then maybe also your

60
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,300
open source project how are you going to

61
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,610
handle issues of IP or trademark

62
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,170
infringement as open source developers

63
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,780
we operate in a pretty complex system

64
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,940
and the fact that it's an open one

65
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,810
doesn't necessarily make it any easier

66
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,610
this week at jas comp we've talked

67
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,770
mostly about the technical elements of

68
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,690
software production systems like the

69
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,790
code the architecture but for the

70
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,530
duration of this talk when I'm referring

71
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,720
to systems I'll be focusing on the human

72
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,140
element and humanity is again kind of an

73
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,660
abstract idea so since this is a

74
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,340
JavaScript conference I decided to

75
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,900
create an MVC framework for thinking

76
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,530
about that kind of abstraction if you're

77
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,120
in a position with your project or

78
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,800
company wherein you need to create a

79
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,010
system for humans remember MVC which is

80
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,500
mission value and change it boils down

81
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,530
to this simple philosophy that every

82
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,800
operator in the system a person a team

83
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,630
you know project of protocol whatever

84
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,750
all of those things have the same job to

85
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,120
execute change that creates value and

86
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,730
service of the mission so let's take a

87
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,810
look really quick at what that means

88
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,300
from NPM modules to boku each component

89
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,490
in our open web system was created for

90
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,740
some reason there's some core objective

91
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,860
or some problem is trying to solve an

92
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,940
entity's mission doesn't really change

93
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,820
over time it's the impotence for change

94
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,790
and not the change itself missions

95
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,070
motivate so in designing systems for

96
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,930
humans make sure you can identify the

97
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,270
mission for every person project and

98
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,440
team in your project or organization

99
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,270
value be a harder thing to nail down

100
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,260
generally when we think of value we

101
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,760
think of quantitative things such as

102
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,370
points scored in a game or like dollars

103
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,979
raised for cancer research quantitative

104
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:39,370
value

105
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,410
tend to be easier to measure and also

106
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,630
names milestones or metrics for success

107
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,210
like getting to version 1 point 0 or

108
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,479
maybe getting 10,000 users but for

109
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,610
humans you need a mix of quantitative

110
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,070
and qualitative value in order to

111
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,460
evaluate your system success qualitative

112
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,630
value is sort of like the intangible

113
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,729
genesee qua that you gain from an effort

114
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:06,340
that you can't really pinpoint but often

115
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,290
relates to some new knowledge you gained

116
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,380
or some subtle shift in opinion you may

117
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,780
not be quite sure how far it Lance's you

118
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,520
toward your mission but you do know that

119
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,039
it at least moved forward the components

120
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,560
in our ecosystem don't exactly exist in

121
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,900
a vacuum they don't spontaneously become

122
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,940
they don't keep evolving on their own

123
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,800
without some sort of process of change

124
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,919
if we think of the mission as an end

125
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,260
we'd like to see brought about changes

126
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,060
the means we're executing toward that

127
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,910
end and sometimes it's big and sometimes

128
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,130
it's small but either way our system

129
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,710
should always be changing for the whole

130
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,930
system to be effective our components

131
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,150
need to work together harmoniously even

132
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,940
as they're changing but they also exist

133
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,160
inside of cultural political and

134
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,860
technical contexts and those things can

135
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,720
have real competing motivations

136
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,750
sometimes so it's nearly impossible for

137
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,070
one system change and not affect others

138
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,710
it's hard to know where or when all of

139
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,820
those changes are going to end up

140
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,610
manifesting like how a positive change

141
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,770
on the technical spectrum might actually

142
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,320
spark a negative change and the

143
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,169
political our JavaScript community

144
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:28,120
obviously cares very much about its

145
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,340
direction and wants to see us move

146
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,800
forward our projects are operating more

147
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,449
transparently and collaborated

148
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:37,240
collaboratively our companies and

149
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,099
organizations are operating in a more

150
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,710
socially responsible way we're paying

151
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,780
more attention now than ever before to

152
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,389
how we address issues of diversity

153
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,570
inclusion and accessibility but complex

154
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,729
systems like ours don't necessarily

155
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:53,110
scale well

156
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,060
they tend to fail far more consistently

157
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,010
on the human element rather than a

158
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:04,010
technical I think we can simplify this

159
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,640
from open source engineer to open source

160
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,710
c-suite I think we all have the same job

161
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,930
which is to support the creation and

162
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,940
exchange of value for the JavaScript

163
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,510
community I do this today at Baku

164
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,400
through identifying and executing

165
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
organizational change that ensures we're

166
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,510
living our mission and everything we do

167
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,970
and today I'll try to do that a little

168
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,770
bit by sharing what i've learned about

169
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,200
organizational design as a means to help

170
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,480
you create and scale your progress your

171
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,100
project or organization in whatever

172
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,990
forward way suits your goals experience

173
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,250
has taught me that if we give more

174
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,410
thought to how we organize ourselves we

175
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,390
can do more for our projects and for the

176
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,390
open web community using organizational

177
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,370
design principles will be better able to

178
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,560
adapt to change will be better able to

179
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,360
communicate our mission will be better

180
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,040
able to exchange value with one another

181
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,690
and we'll be able to do all of this

182
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,930
together in a more proactive and

183
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,440
coordinated fashion for those of you who

184
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,670
are still not sure exactly why this

185
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,370
matters let's take a look at a case

186
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,770
study because business people love case

187
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,850
studies this is from an article by

188
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,280
michael rogers on the nodejs and medium

189
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,680
blog from earlier this month he writes

190
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,490
in 2012 things were going really well we

191
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,410
had a thriving community solid core

192
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,510
contributions and it was really clear

193
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,370
that we were the fastest growing

194
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,010
ecosystem in the world so in 2012

195
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,350
michael says the system was pretty

196
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,930
efficient all of our cultural technical

197
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,610
and political variables all of the

198
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,350
projects and people were operating

199
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,270
harmoniously and things were going good

200
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,800
the growth and change of the project

201
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,770
ended up signaling a future imbalance of

202
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,750
the system though is around this time

203
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,700
people notice some concerns in the

204
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,690
project with the ownership and we end up

205
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,520
seeing some people note that there are

206
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,310
more there's more value being created

207
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,470
for the political spectrum then there is

208
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,450
along the cultural or technical and

209
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,140
people in the system

210
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,420
failing to act on that we can we cut to

211
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,980
2014 everybody agrees that there's a

212
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,050
problem but now the operators in our

213
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,580
human system don't know how to change

214
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,640
and change it growth and change in the

215
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,530
system is slowing becoming less

216
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,180
efficient to the point that the project

217
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,550
becomes forked and now there's no clear

218
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,310
way for them to generate a value if we

219
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,530
cut to today that system is being

220
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,650
restored our no denial projects are both

221
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,660
joining the node foundation with support

222
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,850
from the Linux Foundation and there are

223
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,180
plans for these projects to reintegrate

224
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,380
that's all happening because a lot of

225
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,270
people recognize the imbalance of the

226
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,550
system and set to the very hard work of

227
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,680
restoring it they were organizing in

228
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,840
designing systems through really formal

229
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,490
channels like that of the node advisory

230
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,770
board the IO technical committee and a

231
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,180
bunch of other informal channels like

232
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,340
you know github and IRC they put in

233
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,320
thousands of hours of work had probably

234
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,570
untold numbers of debates and arguments

235
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,730
and so on and so forth all of which to

236
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,820
restore harmony in our human open web

237
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,130
ecosystem and so on behalf of beaucoup

238
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,840
I'd like to say thank you to those folks

239
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,970
including Chris for doing that because

240
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,180
it's really hard the thing is their

241
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,400
problems are not unique and another post

242
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,440
on the node blog Michael Dolan was a

243
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,670
director and attorney for the

244
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,950
collaborative projects at Linux

245
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,930
Foundation said that they found that the

246
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,030
challenges of node and i/o communities

247
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,040
are not unique many of the open source

248
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,930
projects that they have also struggle

249
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,360
with the same challenges and went on to

250
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,940
these lists five key features of an open

251
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,490
collaboration project it's clear that

252
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,050
the node foundation is going to be

253
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,910
relying on and learning a lot from this

254
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,400
and there's lots of early indication

255
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,300
that they're going to end up being very

256
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,400
successful with this but an open

257
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,230
governance model doesn't necessarily

258
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,660
guarantee success or growth I think

259
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,760
that's because openness is a soul ideal

260
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,610
is really tricky to nail down the

261
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,530
rhetoric of openness is to meant to

262
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,270
communicate a favorable set of values

263
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,490
and those values often depend on the

264
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,790
speaker and on the audience and the absa

265
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,830
of a single definition that suits all of

266
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,160
those parties we tend to take open to

267
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,730
mean inclusive of everything so if we

268
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,380
want to be successful with our open

269
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,080
collaboration projects we're going to

270
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,120
have to get more specific about our

271
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,560
ideals and our values thoughtful

272
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,080
organizational design helps us balance

273
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,030
the fear of chaos and the fear of

274
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,580
structure inherent in an open system so

275
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,490
that the whole thing can move forward

276
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,990
it's a combination of abstract

277
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,840
philosophy like why we're even here and

278
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,340
what's the meaning of life that kind of

279
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,100
philosophy and concrete structures to

280
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,650
help we humans do things together more

281
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,350
effectively or perhaps put in terms of

282
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,780
the MVC model of earlier it helps us

283
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,520
frame our decisions about change and

284
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,780
value in terms of our mission but I've

285
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,030
certainly talked about abstractions long

286
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,100
enough so it's time to get a little bit

287
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,130
more specific purpose it's part of

288
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,700
organizational design and that's

289
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,440
something that you supply for yourself

290
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,260
and your projects if you're doing a

291
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,480
thing you should probably probably know

292
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,390
why you're doing it if you're thinking

293
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,860
about growing your project or

294
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,140
organization probably you should go

295
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,060
through the process of discussing it and

296
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,400
writing it down right right those

297
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,930
purpose and values down with your core

298
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,540
team so you all understand them and

299
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,580
reread that together fairly regularly

300
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,310
this is going to help you keep that top

301
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,820
of mind as you make decisions and share

302
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,100
it outside of your core team maybe put

303
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,680
it on your website or your read me it

304
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,630
will help you attract other users and

305
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,370
collaborators who identify with your

306
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,320
project who maybe didn't understand it

307
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,670
in the first place but they connect with

308
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,470
you on the purpose level and that's

309
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,139
really important

310
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:13,680
governance is a more tangible idea than

311
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,680
purpose so as a result we tend to solve

312
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,570
problems using the realm of governance

313
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,389
over the realm of purpose governance

314
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:23,610
also means a lot of things so as an idea

315
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,800
can get really confusing but generally

316
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,959
speaking governance structures provide

317
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,720
the trellis upon which we can grow our

318
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,610
purpose and and those some of some of

319
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,029
those structures include corporate form

320
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,470
decision-making structures and decision

321
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,639
enforcement structures so what's

322
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,949
corporate form corporate form is any

323
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:47,940
group of persons treated as treated by

324
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,940
law as an a single entity having riots

325
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,550
or liabilities that are distinct from

326
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,029
the persons composing it and it's very

327
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,949
necessary for a lot of components in our

328
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:01,019
system including like the open source

329
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,000
foundations or standards bodies or

330
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,639
companies and maybe even one day your

331
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,860
project or your business corporate forms

332
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,440
things like C corpse LLC's they follow

333
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,880
different rules and they have different

334
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,370
rights depending also on the government

335
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,570
the government under which they were

336
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,699
incorporated and the government's under

337
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,680
which they operate and this starts to

338
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,890
make a difference as your project scales

339
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,380
if you think you might want to take your

340
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,750
project to a foundation or perhaps see

341
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,890
it through some sort of official

342
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,470
standardization process definitely take

343
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,390
a look at the corporate form of that

344
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,130
entity first because it might end up

345
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,920
making a difference decision-making

346
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,620
structures that's the who makes

347
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,160
decisions and how they do it in our open

348
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,230
source world this is generally all over

349
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,959
the map we have everything from like

350
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,209
that oh yeah whatever laws a fair kind

351
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,699
of decision making that happens to some

352
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,819
form of democratic process to you know

353
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,779
maybe a benevolent dictatorship and

354
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,920
foundations and standards bodies though

355
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,260
tend to operate a form of collaborative

356
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,199
governance and we're in all of those

357
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,389
stakeholders are collectively empowered

358
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:18,120
to make a decision through consensus and

359
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,760
or as is the case with equi

360
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,270
International that standardizes

361
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,300
and becca strip script to make

362
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,610
recommendations to an appointed final

363
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,650
decision body who does not substantially

364
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,870
change consensus recommendations from

365
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,500
the group they are judicious and nature

366
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,360
keep in mind that how you make decisions

367
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,760
for your project will change over time

368
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,070
depending largely on the stakeholders

369
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,600
you have and also what those

370
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,430
stakeholders value as those people

371
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,110
change the values are going to change

372
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,170
and that's ok if you think you'll move

373
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,690
forward towards the nonprofit or

374
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,730
standards track with your project and

375
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,090
then plan now for your transition to a

376
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,190
collaborative decision making a model

377
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,010
because that's actually along and and

378
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:08,200
you know can be a tricky Road no matter

379
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
how you make them degens don't really

380
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,910
mean anything unless you have some means

381
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,310
to enforce them and that though and

382
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,830
those means are actually useful there

383
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,570
are proactive decision enforcement

384
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,120
structures like testing suites and code

385
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,740
review protocols and things like that

386
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,740
and they help reinforce the decision and

387
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,100
mitigate risk before something happens

388
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,480
there are also reactive decision

389
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,370
enforcement structures that reinforce

390
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,790
decision at decisions after exposure has

391
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,590
already occurred so after something has

392
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,630
happened and these are things like clas

393
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,020
or codes of conduct you'll need to

394
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,570
consider your use of both forms

395
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,970
depending on the risks you think you

396
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,370
might be exposed to and if you think a

397
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,110
risk is really high you're probably

398
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,240
going to want to use more substantial

399
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:05,240
forms of both in order to mitigate it

400
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,540
successful systems can be attributed to

401
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,120
the skill we exercise and designing them

402
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,560
which is all that governance stuff we

403
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,200
were just talking about and making those

404
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,700
right government of choices in the first

405
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,610
place and also to the quality of the

406
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,810
operations of that system so here are a

407
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,540
few principles for us to consider as you

408
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,790
think about the operation of your human

409
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:33,280
system the first is simplicity as we

410
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,220
covered previous

411
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,530
complexity is not viral problems of

412
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,450
process and communication multiplied

413
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,550
with each successive stage of complexity

414
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,950
that you add so when operating your

415
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,010
organization and i like to say don't

416
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,040
play chess when you can play checkers be

417
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,080
precise with your definitions and tasks

418
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,870
people like that and don't try to build

419
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,600
a system or set policies and things like

420
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,160
that that solve a hundred percent of

421
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,930
your problems up front but rather

422
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,110
optimize your organization for one that

423
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,600
throws good errors over one that throws

424
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:14,510
bad errors the second is flexibility

425
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,190
organizations should have structure but

426
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,980
not be entirely rigid your organization

427
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,410
should let people in it make adjustments

428
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,810
based on new information from how

429
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,090
they're operating it that doesn't mean

430
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,650
that you're letting them like totally

431
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,660
change the goals or objectives here but

432
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,700
rather letting them change how they're

433
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,950
approaching that goal or objective based

434
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,420
on the new data that they have and

435
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,440
remember that there are also many

436
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,110
motivations for change why they might be

437
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,140
making a change in approach and you may

438
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,110
be tempted to only allow those changes

439
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,830
that align with your own motivations but

440
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,170
organizations are not personal things

441
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,370
and they're going to operate at times

442
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,380
with different motivations from yours

443
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,720
that's also a okay that's actually good

444
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,650
the third principle here is reliability

445
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,210
err I'm sorry yep reliability any system

446
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,250
is actually no more reliable than its

447
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,770
weakest component and reliability is

448
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,450
maintaining consistency in your

449
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,540
operations and also in your output of

450
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,910
both the human sort and the technical

451
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,660
sort it essentially means that it there

452
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,270
should be no surprises for people in an

453
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,610
organization or for the people who rely

454
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,890
on it reliability is also as important

455
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,160
for organizational growth as in as

456
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,380
innovation and software development

457
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,260
there can be some tension between

458
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,890
reliability and

459
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,170
vation in the system so you're going to

460
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,330
want to plan upfront for how you think

461
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,850
about balancing that in your

462
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,070
organization and as you would on your

463
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,140
project how you think about balancing

464
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,220
the stability and balancing the growth

465
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,090
our fourth principle which is probably

466
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,370
one of the most important is

467
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:12,660
acceptability any organization no matter

468
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,090
how well-designed it is is not going to

469
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,610
function properly unless it is accepted

470
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,070
by the people who operate it if

471
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,200
participants don't believe that the

472
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,580
organizational system is going to

473
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,830
benefit them if they are opposed to it

474
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,080
if they are pressured into using it or

475
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,340
if they think it's generally a bad

476
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,620
system and it's not going to work as

477
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,540
things and as you intended and two

478
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,180
things are going to happen either it's

479
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,860
going to be modified gradually over time

480
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,660
by the people who are using it which is

481
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,730
you know good but you know slow and

482
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,170
arduous or it will be used overall

483
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,920
ineffectively and ultimately fail so

484
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,040
make sure you're getting clear buy-in

485
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,900
from others in your organization and pay

486
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,660
close attention to resistance any

487
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,190
resistance that you feel that

488
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,380
organizational resistance and push back

489
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,930
is a human error message pay attention

490
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:10,470
to it if anything I've said today sounds

491
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,320
familiar it's probably because there is

492
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,180
a lot of similar thinking when it comes

493
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,190
to designing systems for software and

494
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,120
designing systems for people in both

495
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,960
forms of system architecture simplicity

496
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,480
reliability and flexibility are

497
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,680
frequently at tension with one another

498
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,990
and the general belief is that you

499
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,540
really can only have two of the three at

500
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,520
any given point and if you've happened

501
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,690
to figure out how to get all three in

502
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,950
your system I would really like to talk

503
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:43,200
to you in either case remember that

504
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,570
organizational design is the means and

505
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,940
not the end it's the framework through

506
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,410
which we will try and live our core

507
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,080
values and qualities and not how we try

508
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,600
and measure our success no matter what

509
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,520
stage you're at in your project it's

510
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,830
really never too early to think about

511
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,920
organizational design speaking of which

512
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,820
I think we can organize ourselves for a

513
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,100
better open web community and that we

514
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,530
can and should start doing that right

515
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,020
now because changes outside of our

516
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,820
control are impacting us there's a lot

517
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,130
of external and environmental and market

518
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,630
changes going on that we can't really

519
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,720
control things like big projects merging

520
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,240
we have a lot of new software

521
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,940
foundation's forming and old ones are

522
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,430
changing as well and companies are

523
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,800
investing is never before in open source

524
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,950
software all this means that there's a

525
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,960
lot of interest attention and money

526
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,300
being paid to how organizations interact

527
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,730
intersect and engage with open source

528
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,040
projects and we need to be able to

529
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,540
communicate and we have for our

530
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,940
community to these companies I chose to

531
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,650
speak today because I'm often asked how

532
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,710
we do things at boku those specifics

533
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,690
don't necessarily apply to everyone here

534
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,820
so I chose to bring you all a framework

535
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,030
we use to make those decisions I think

536
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,310
rising tide lifts all boats and I

537
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,750
believe that we can help each other more

538
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,150
efficiently and reliably using the tools

539
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,360
of organizational design i'm jory person

540
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,340
thank you very much for listening to me

541
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,890
today if I can help you in any way and

542
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,620
please hit me up on Twitter or github or
