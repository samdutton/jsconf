00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:12,150

awesome thank you whoa this is too loud

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,309
I can hear myself at least that's good

3
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:23,910
um thank you for coming um so let's see

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:01:20,250
what's goes that should do it ok so if

5
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,000
they're so I think I think we've all

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,650
seen this world been in this situation

7
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:33,800
ourselves I have at least a lot of time

8
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,790
it's a really frustrating situation and

9
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,280
it says there's paper cam and you look

10
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,570
in it and you're open it up and there is

11
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,110
no paper can what a really think is

12
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,100
going on it's actually that the I mean

13
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,210
if you were a piece of paper in the

14
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,620
printer stock there all day you wanted

15
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,830
to have a have a little bit of relaxed

16
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,780
time and do some gaming right so maybe

17
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,290
it's not all that bad so we're looking

18
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,670
at a printer errors i came across this

19
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,200
conservation is working at a library and

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,970
i'm sure i couldn't figure out I didn't

21
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,980
know if it's a woman or a man but I

22
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,540
couldn't figure out the name of the

23
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,330
person but the person found this really

24
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,690
interesting 18th century newspaper with

25
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,640
something I think we've all seen on the

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,320
back of the this page we're seeing here

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,870
this is from a newspaper called purple I

28
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,480
think on the back it's is it's a smooth

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,230
printing everything is fine but on the

30
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,200
front side of the paper we have this

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,140
weird crease and when you when you when

32
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,120
you pull it you you have a printing

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,790
error because the piece of paper was

34
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,260
folded in a way when it went through the

35
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,260
printing press in the 1800 so printing

36
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,850
errors are nothing new this is also i

37
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,180
think one of my favorites it makes

38
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,590
absolutely no sense researching this I i

39
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,350
found that maybe makes more sense to you

40
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,600
guys and destiny because apparently a

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,019
letter is a size of paper that you use

42
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:19,390
in America but in Europe we like these

43
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,630
like nice even things that can divide up

44
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,550
into human smaller parts so we have a

45
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,440
different kind of letter or paper size

46
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,590
system called a4 a5 a6 but still I think

47
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,130
this was one of my

48
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,490
first first time to show this this this

49
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,880
era it was on an HP Latex yet and

50
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,380
actually the pc load that comes from the

51
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:48,170
HP series and the reason why it says pc

52
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,970
is basically this means paper cassettes

53
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,160
a paper cassette load letter just said

54
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,320
you're trying to print something to the

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,630
printer and there is like not a letter

56
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,610
so there's like an a4 piece of paper in

57
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,870
the printer but there's not a letter

58
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,850
piece of paper so please load some

59
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,230
letter because I can't print this thing

60
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,300
you're sending to me and the reason why

61
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,160
it says pc is because if we go back to

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,470
early printers you didn't have a nice

63
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,240
big display as we saw before you had

64
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,070
like two digits on the left that which

65
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,570
basically just a status code like you

66
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,150
have n HTTP status code or whatever I

67
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,760
mean serious zero means everything is ok

68
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,980
I'm ready to to accept print jobs but

69
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,370
you can have pc in there so so that

70
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,690
carried our way through to the large

71
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:35,180
plate when you when we have those so so

72
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,830
what got me into throw this this

73
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,820
printing stuff um to understand that i

74
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,360
will just tell you a little story about

75
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,170
a year ago I was fiddling around with I

76
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,940
have a lot of papal devices and one of

77
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,490
them is an apple TV and you could sense

78
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,110
it up to it and i also have an airport

79
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,550
express you could send music to that

80
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,130
into play music and I was all like fine

81
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,420
but I wanted to like be able to like

82
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,610
tweak the volume a little bit more than

83
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,620
you'd normally would be able to do so I

84
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,650
thinking could you like have a proxy in

85
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,270
between if you do something but then you

86
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,580
needed to like send the audio to that

87
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,080
proxy on that we have to send it to the

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,860
to the actual airport express to play

89
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,080
the music and I found out something

90
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,610
called airfoil they could do this but

91
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,590
you have to pay money otherwise after

92
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,810
like I think it's like 10 minutes it

93
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,580
will start to play static instead of the

94
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,900
music if you haven't paid the bills so I

95
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,000
was like I was looking online and I

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,380
found like a lot of open source project

97
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,300
that was doing this and but all of them

98
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,460
they were literally more like I want to

99
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,410
be a client and I want to talk to an

100
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,540
airport express on Apple TV and I was

101
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,919
like the other way around but I want to

102
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,330
I want to be an able to do I want to be

103
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,160
an airport express its their way to do

104
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,420
that so I

105
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,310
I realized that somebody already did a

106
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,870
little bit of research into the protocol

107
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,430
behind it but nobody actually

108
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,220
implemented a proper server so i went

109
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,640
ahead and thought okay I could do that

110
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,650
which was my talk at JS con tu this year

111
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,770
about how to to be an apple TV but

112
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,950
during this process I figured out that

113
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,260
the way that Apple TV works and the way

114
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,510
that you just pull up your phone and you

115
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,340
on YouTube and you want to just show

116
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,100
what you have on your phone on your TV

117
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,660
it just magically pops up and says apple

118
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,430
TV living room or whatever you did you

119
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,530
name it and it's like how does that work

120
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,730
and they figured out it was something

121
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,920
called puncture and then it I've

122
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,420
research that and I figured out that i'm

123
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,870
sure it's basically just a standard it's

124
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,370
baby the branding understand that

125
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,860
fracture isn't a is a name that that

126
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,630
Apple decided but the standard is called

127
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,530
silicon and silicon is an RFC or it's a

128
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,230
lot of RAC rfcs on the internet so it's

129
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,940
an open standard everybody can can take

130
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,370
a look at it and it's basically behind

131
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,540
the scenes is basically just doing

132
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,090
what's called multicast DNS so when you

133
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,510
have a local network you broadcast

134
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,820
package to the network saying a here i

135
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,510
am and i have these capabilities and my

136
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,730
name is called apple TV living room and

137
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,740
stuff like that let's hold standard for

138
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,380
that and it's called empty and SSD or

139
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,530
the SVS for service discovery and I

140
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,750
found that out and those was like that's

141
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,110
interesting and on NPM there is a module

142
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,480
called emptiness which basically just a

143
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,610
shallow binding and Telep apples

144
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,540
binaries for doing our emptiness stuff

145
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,450
like advertising a service on the under

146
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,000
local network which means that if you

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,740
have to compile it it doesn't compile on

148
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,340
system stuff so I thought okay um maybe

149
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,730
we can do this in native JavaScript in

150
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,210
or a note where I'm a note developer and

151
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,460
a friend of mine Matthias a meth in

152
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,850
church on Twitter and get up y'all will

153
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,600
you broach a very very low level mdns

154
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,660
arm module that basically just allows

155
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,220
you to send them a zpack

156
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,950
but it's nothing more than that where

157
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,170
the emptiness SD standard the service

158
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,090
discovery stand out that that you like

159
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,170
advertise the service on the network

160
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,580
specific specifically says there's like

161
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,310
three Rick NS records that you need to

162
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,480
use to do that you need it you have a

163
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,210
txt record 60 record is kind of like an

164
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,710
holdall record is this like a blob of

165
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,900
data I think it like hold a lot of

166
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,760
information about like the capability so

167
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,960
if you have OCD and stuff like that then

168
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,870
you need a SRV record which is basically

169
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,000
it's a fancy form of a record a record

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,099
the one you have for your domain it says

171
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,370
i have my domain com and it points to

172
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,349
this IP address but that s re work or

173
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:44,060
does the same thing except also specify

174
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,620
support number so it's actually really

175
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,940
really really nice so you don't have to

176
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,800
rely on a default for number like 40 80

177
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,170
for HTTP you can have a service running

178
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,360
on any port and then you had the final

179
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,190
one was a PTR record was basically just

180
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,490
a way to point to to to the ride a sorry

181
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,290
record to to you so you had the PTR

182
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,630
record hold says I have an embassy I

183
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,430
have an apple TV and then the punch to

184
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,800
the to this is a rebate code that has a

185
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,570
name of the Apple TV that you want

186
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,339
bigger be defined that name any time you

187
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:15,290
want how to be called living room or

188
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,780
whatever so I was looking into this and

189
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,240
I made a module called Sarah conf which

190
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,600
basically does this and while I was

191
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,190
doing that I took a look at all the

192
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,839
different kind of services you could

193
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,940
advertise on a network and this is part

194
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,680
of a huge huge huge document of

195
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
different services you can advertise on

196
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,640
the network some of them are proprietary

197
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,589
it's all it's all managed by i am a

198
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,730
internet assigned name and numbers the

199
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,770
same guys who also does um like you I

200
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,990
think they do comment on it and all that

201
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,390
stuff as well and there's one thing in

202
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,950
particular that destruction was like I

203
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,890
PP like what's that incident printing

204
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,820
for the call never heard about that

205
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,290
before um and I was thinking okay this

206
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,150
is this is service discovery this is

207
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,460
cyracom that I whole premise about about

208
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,290
Sara Khan is that you just pluck and

209
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,270
plays like no drivers it just worked you

210
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,100
don't even have to do configuration you

211
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,780
have to enter anything into anything you

212
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,089
just

213
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:17,040
quick and it just works so it's like how

214
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,839
can you have a printer they would you

215
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,480
could and it just works that seemed to

216
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,009
change me but normally I would think you

217
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:28,259
and each have drivers and stuff so I did

218
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,809
a little research into well I basic just

219
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,089
to use my silicon modules and say okay

220
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:36,870
I'm a I'm an IPP service and I'm on unit

221
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,790
I'm on your network and I'm I'm I'm for

222
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,170
3000 on my local and then I went into

223
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,990
system preferences and said okay let's

224
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,790
try to add a printer and lo behold there

225
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,709
was a printer called he gave it a name I

226
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:52,709
think it called it nokia something and

227
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:54,029
it's like printer called no jansen like

228
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,040
this is interesting what happens if i

229
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,449
install it so i click install and it

230
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,470
just went through and everything was

231
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,550
just working like it got installed but

232
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,769
if you if you everybody just said before

233
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,689
that I just basically advertiser

234
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:08,879
services in actually set up a server

235
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,100
listening on port 3000 I just add this

236
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,579
active service I was like okay probably

237
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,759
i can't print trip then so but but just

238
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,279
to check i spun up a tcp server on port

239
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,829
3000 and was listening for a connection

240
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,300
and then I tried to print it and see

241
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,220
what happened and there was a blob

242
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,509
coming in so something happening

243
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:29,220
something was happening but the print

244
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,050
job didn't go through it just said error

245
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,610
your friend Jeff just said error but I

246
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,290
got some data and I was looking at the

247
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,249
data it's like wait a second he likes he

248
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:39,809
was asking i could look in the hex and

249
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:42,569
it was a ski and it was like POS t /

250
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,689
HTTP and it eco did it and it looks

251
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:48,240
something like this it's like that's

252
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,379
just HTTP this is easy but better about

253
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,120
to check out this this whole ITP thing

254
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,879
so when I look there is also an RC so

255
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,110
you can go and look at the standard I've

256
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,179
become pretty good at reading RFC by the

257
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:05,069
way it's a pretty a pretty bad skill to

258
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:11,550
have maybe on um so so finally realized

259
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,980
what this IP hbu was so basically I PP

260
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,350
is actually a binary protocol but it's

261
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,990
using HTTP as a transport layer so the

262
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,370
operation layer is binary but the

263
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,050
transport layer is a tease p sub we all

264
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,839
speak HTTP and it's the only way twerks

265
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,429
is it just using post requests all the

266
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,920
time it's only it's only method you

267
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,040
always post request usually just just /

268
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,779
but you can have like different printers

269
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:34,920
on the same for and they will have a

270
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,470
different name a different path but if

271
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,300
you just have one printer we just have

272
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,399
it on this / and the reason why it uses

273
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,010
the slashes because in my in my when I

274
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,180
broadcasted the the service on the local

275
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,610
network I guess that I didn't say

276
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,620
anything so it just assume / I didn't

277
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,639
give it a path and you can see it's the

278
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,190
user agent in this is from OS 10 and the

279
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,810
user agencies cups which is can remember

280
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,990
what the sea is but a unique sprinting

281
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,100
service so what tournament comment yes

282
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,320
common unix printing service which is a

283
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,620
pretty found out like pretty well

284
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,410
established library on on linux and unix

285
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,510
and OSN so after the after the headers

286
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,470
these are these are the headers there's

287
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,610
nothing more than this after the head of

288
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,260
the body calm the body is a binary this

289
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,279
binary blob of operational protocol and

290
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,320
if you look at the hex of that it always

291
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,660
starts with two punch which is the

292
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,310
version number of a key piece and that

293
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,800
this is versions 1.1 and it has an

294
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,930
operation ID which tells the printer

295
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,660
like what is the client trying to do in

296
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,630
this cage is in this case is operation

297
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,959
11 which means get printer attributes so

298
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,550
the client is asking the printer what

299
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,560
capabilities that's the printer have and

300
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,649
there is a request ID which basically

301
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,560
means that every time I server response

302
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,240
needs to like just have the same request

303
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,459
ID at it is responding to so you can

304
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:09,750
have multiple requests running at the

305
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,560
same time and then comes a lot of what's

306
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,959
called attribute groups and attribute

307
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,920
groups are spaced with a the limit

308
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,790
attack and the limit attack 01 is this

309
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,079
what's called the operation attribute

310
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,880
group and it has like a lot of stuff

311
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,949
which basically is like key value pairs

312
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:30,870
and some can be like a raise and they

313
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,430
think the kind of like invented their

314
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,709
own system for storing data which is

315
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,589
really weird and then finally after you

316
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,510
get like a lot of these like data that

317
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,430
you i a'n't trying to send to them

318
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,200
sent to the server you get an 03 delimit

319
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,910
attack which basically means end of

320
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,680
attributes no more attributes we're done

321
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,260
now actually comes the document you're

322
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,550
trying to print it we're trying to print

323
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,140
in traffic in this case we're trying to

324
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,370
get the printers attribute so there's no

325
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,720
document but if we were trying to print

326
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,670
then the actual document which is

327
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,339
usually post script but can actually

328
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:08,709
can't be anything will come up with so I

329
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,950
wrote this thing IPP encoder which is a

330
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,350
encoder decoder module on NPM that you

331
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,300
can use to include a decode these are

332
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,520
lots of data and around that was pretty

333
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,649
simple to write something called IPP

334
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,080
printer which basically just sets up an

335
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,990
HTTP server optionally broadcast using

336
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,540
zero crowns on the network saying hey

337
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,029
you here I am this is my name I'm under

338
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,529
support and then just basically takes

339
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:43,660
whatever it gets and pipes it into the

340
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,690
encoder and handles the response and

341
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,110
make sure that then response so when it

342
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,740
gets I pee pee when it gets the get

343
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,900
printer attributes it knows how to

344
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,980
respond like it could be stuff like do

345
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,350
you support color or how many trays do

346
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,660
you have or what is the level of your

347
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,529
toner or stuff like that which is and

348
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:10,330
you can send error Coast back actually

349
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:18,089
you could like do pc load letter oh yeah

350
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:23,699
let's do that them okay

351
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:33,019
so boom so let's try to print something

352
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:49,040
maybe i should actually so so if we

353
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,959
basically can do I MPM install I peachy

354
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,850
printer and you can use it

355
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,290
programmatically so you can required

356
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,749
from your own stuff or you can there's

357
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,579
like it just a command line tool that

358
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:05,699
you can get run and now it's listening

359
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,000
on a port and it's broadcasting at the

360
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,659
same time so let's open system

361
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,380
preferences let's go to printers and

362
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,380
scanners let's add an infringer and

363
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,589
there we have it IPP printer that record

364
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,610
anything but let's do this you can see

365
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,639
it it's a generic postscript printer so

366
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:35,850
just no prescrip which is really nice I

367
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,730
click Add Printer and yeah that's fine

368
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:45,210
let's do this boom I have any printed so

369
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:50,610
um so let's I wasn't joking let's try to

370
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,210
print with sliced what do you have them

371
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:01,320
let's type in two slides so you see the

372
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,919
printer is chosen here and it's print

373
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,169
hello this was going on here while

374
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,870
printing

375
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,380
but that was it printed and there was a

376
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,530
PS file appears it's pro script so

377
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:36,860
that's why can't you take and preview is

378
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,220
really we need at an understanding coach

379
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,740
gift so we have my five pretty simple so

380
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,000
now we have a printer it's written a

381
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,260
note um and you can do a lot of cool

382
00:18:51,260 --> 00:19:00,770
stuff of that oh yeah um no actually I

383
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,510
should so there's something called ghost

384
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,340
so i made so I made something else from

385
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,130
print cat there's a lot of opportunity

386
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,230
and gifts for print cat by the way so

387
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,670
what we want to do is you want to pipe

388
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:23,890
print or a pipe red cap to PS yes to PDF

389
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,650
meeting from standard in and riding

390
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,860
through stand up writing through to drop

391
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,559
the PF let's do this just run that and

392
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,540
then let's go bag in his add a new

393
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:41,770
printer now we have to print a printer

394
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:50,120
this let's go let this go in them in

395
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,800
Prince of life again and I think I'd

396
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,200
friend oh yes

397
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,409
and it will exit when it's when it's got

398
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,840
the first print job printhead wit will

399
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,419
exit but there goes it's an art you

400
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,130
basically just converted my my print you

401
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:14,289
up to PDF yep job yeah there we go boom

402
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:17,470
not as full of this all over the hook

403
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:22,820
okay yes cool um so that's a lot of cool

404
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,690
stuff you can do it actually if you just

405
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,460
run this again and then you can specify

406
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:45,039
a debug flag it's just our

407
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:53,059
this woops caps lock okay just want to

408
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,080
show you so if you try to print

409
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:01,360
something again this princess a thing I

410
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,590
think you see the traffic that goes on

411
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,299
there's a lot of calls back and forth to

412
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:13,999
to figure out what to do cool so all

413
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:17,480
this remember the hex the binary stuff

414
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,980
that i showed you before I basically

415
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,070
made a format that is really a little

416
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,759
bit easier to understand so so i decoded

417
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,710
and so what you can do is you can also

418
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,989
encoded using giving it giving it this

419
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,549
so if you want to make a response to a

420
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:34,309
printing client you can give gay son

421
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,669
values like this here basically this

422
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:39,350
seems to be a response to it probably

423
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,539
asking like do you support maaga colors

424
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,230
and i write back no i don't support it

425
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,179
this is a big quiz it's giving so this

426
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:49,279
is actually operation 11 the one you saw

427
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,649
before um it's saying Rick you

428
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:55,850
questioned some attributes for the

429
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,139
printer like Margot I swagga names media

430
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:01,759
supported I guess operation supported

431
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,379
print column of supported stuff like

432
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:05,299
that and I was finding back with this is

433
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,590
the stuff i don't know and then i miss

434
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,379
funding back with this is the stuff I

435
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:12,940
know so I I suppose these operations and

436
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,379
my printer state is currently three

437
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:18,590
which is idle and the reason for being

438
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,570
idle is apparently none that's the stuff

439
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,700
you do and these are all the document

440
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,960
formats I support like PDF pro script

441
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:40,580
plain stuff like that anyways ok so it's

442
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,059
what you do this I made a print to

443
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:46,489
Kindle I you can print something and it

444
00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:48,009
appears on you can that's pretty neat

445
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:49,970
instead of you having to email it to

446
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,859
this like weird email that said that

447
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:53,990
Amazon gives you or you could like print

448
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,869
to your accounting system so so at least

449
00:22:56,869 --> 00:22:58,940
in in the my accounting system

450
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,030
when I need to do my taxes it would be

451
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,930
nice if I have like the PDF of the

452
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:10,580
invoice that I'm or the the receipt so

453
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,070
if you adjust and it most accounting

454
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,390
system have this or many accounting

455
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,490
systems have this feature awake and you

456
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,440
can like import like a scanned version

457
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,570
of your of this stuff you your view of

458
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,460
your doing your book Camilla bookkeeping

459
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,770
on or I don't know you could print to

460
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,730
tweet I don't know how that we work this

461
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,170
stuff I'm working on now is NC fa e CP

462
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,600
which it stands for NASA's Nate NSA CIA

463
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,150
FBI ultra censoring printer basically

464
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,230
what you do is you print something and

465
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,220
it comes out like this I was also

466
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,240
working with the idea that you could

467
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,720
probably are change words inside your

468
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,350
documents to be funny one way or the

469
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:58,250
other or inject ads may be other so I

470
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,260
wrote this thing print bin last night

471
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:12,060
and print bin

472
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,780
this is print bit do you guys know

473
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,100
subtag made something called HTML pin

474
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,620
and there is a similar services out

475
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,690
there this is print win basically it's a

476
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,310
printer on the internet and everybody

477
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:28,930
can print to it and the jobs they

478
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,000
basically show up here and somebody

479
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,250
printed I usually be really careful what

480
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,770
you click here by the way because people

481
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,780
can print any sort of stuff I what I was

482
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,100
check I was looking at this the other

483
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,960
day just to be sure apparently nobody i

484
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,850
just made it yesterday so but this is

485
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,400
actually not me who printed list but

486
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,440
apparently somebody on twitter founded

487
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,930
and Crixus into this i don't know who it

488
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:56,800
was so and you could go here and you can

489
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,980
see details grow so basically all you do

490
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,380
new MPM install print- as a as a global

491
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,930
and primp in is basically just a proxy

492
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,000
it actually it's not a printer it's not

493
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,860
even a proxy that even is wrong size of

494
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,370
proxy all it does is it saying hey I'm a

495
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,560
printer on the network using the

496
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,050
puncture the circumstance out oh and my

497
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,860
IP is and then it just points over there

498
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,990
to to the internet and it basically just

499
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,730
allows you to have a little demon

500
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,290
running that's basically advertising a

501
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,520
printer that's not even on your local

502
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:45,600
network so that so we pay to be start

503
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,880
printing now I besides the printer on

504
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,430
you'd open up for another school so

505
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,620
let's go back here let's add a printer

506
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,320
we have print pin

507
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,610
awesome so now let's try to print this

508
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:11,390
too and you can you have selected pimpin

509
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,820
um let me go to there was a time go back

510
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:22,570
and then reload page and wait a little

511
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:33,310
bit there was postscript is extremely

512
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:36,190
huge by the way it's like a lot of lot

513
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,760
of data max often he tried to print the

514
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,580
Bible to me just as a joke because I was

515
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,440
advertising a printer on my local

516
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,940
network and he was like her kind of

517
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,200
printer Bible it was it was place he

518
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,180
just text a lot of pages though but it

519
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,410
was just text there was no images no

520
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,190
nothing it was stripped down version and

521
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,460
the HTML itself was like a few megabytes

522
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,770
the the PostScript was 630 megabytes

523
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,460
that's like it's just text I don't know

524
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:21,890
postcode is a funny funny funny fomin so
