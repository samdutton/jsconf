hi my name is Jade song Gomez I'm from

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,190
Brazil it's my second time in Buenos

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,580
Aires and I'm i feel i am home because

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,380
when as itÃ­s looks like porto alegre but

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,990
much much bigger and then i'm home

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,660
buenos aires awesome my talk was about

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,140
es6 the next version of java script we

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,840
have a lot of changes in the language we

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,420
have a basic stuff and main features and

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,720
my talk was about that i'm showing how

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,079
to use in it today because the

12
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,180
specification will be releasing just in

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,360
the next year but you can use it now and

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,059
my toughest about this the main features

15
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,790
i think is modules we can now have

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,730
separated modules in javascript and they

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,340
have arrow functions that similar to

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,309
lambda is in another language and fix a

19
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,200
lot of issues that we already have it

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,119
javascript i really believe in

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,880
JavaScript so I think the present and

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,880
the future will be about javascript

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,090
javascript is already running in a lot

24
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,569
of different environments and I think

25
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:25,610
the you can bet on on javascript

26
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,280
javascript is one of the pillars of the

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,229
one of the skeletons of the internet so

28
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,970
javascript is spread is we use it

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,849
everywhere everywhere website is using

30
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,390
javascript and with the new

31
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,119
specification we without now developers

32
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,099
have another way to do what we are doing
