00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,910

oh hang on a moment I got a tweet to get

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,369
one of those for your counts here

3
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:17,609
alright I hope you all have tweeted and

4
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,699
got in your accounts in and start a

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,789
stopwatch there we go so hello there I'm

6
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,410
Rachel neighbors and thank you for the

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,859
lovely introduction I used to be well I

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,570
guess technically I still am an

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,180
award-winning cartoonist I for many

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,450
years made a comic forks website called

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,940
girl calm and it was specifically for

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,579
teenage girls by teenage girls and this

13
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,710
little fellow here that's my alter ego

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,690
with the red hair known as Rachel too

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,280
great and the little fellow she's

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,070
holding that's tuna p cats and i dare

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,379
say he was more popular of the two and

18
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,110
if I'd kept staying in comics probably

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,559
would have had his own spin-off series

20
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,420
so I was making comics up until around

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,789
two thousand seven I want an award for

22
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,680
best new female talent in the industry

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,600
and it was everything was really cool

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,570
but then life struck and I had to get to

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,000
health insurance and you know get a real

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,130
job and all those things and I was sad

27
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,500
because one of my one of my dreams was

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,000
that one day my comics would be so

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,750
popular I would be able to have my own

30
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,840
cartoon based on them and I thought well

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,360
you know now that I'm in web development

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,189
one day maybe I'll learn flash and I'll

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,439
make that happen well they kept putting

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,640
off learning flash and learning flash

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,250
and and then I found out flash was not

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,869
the thing to learn anymore and said all

37
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,189
right I'll learn JavaScript I learn

38
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,670
JavaScript I was crazy about CSS always

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,619
been a big CSS nerd I know when people

40
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,299
think of front-end developers they tend

41
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,979
to think of JavaScript developers and

42
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,540
this makes it really hard to interview

43
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,420
for jobs by the way just really hard but

44
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,630
I was looking at the css3 spec one day

45
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,840
and I I noticed that there was this

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,280
property I could use to actually imitate

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,610
keyframes keyframe animation and that's

48
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,560
when the madness started and eventually

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,239
led to my quitting my job and traveling

50
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,830
around at conferences and just showing

51
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,480
this nifty thing

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,040
eventually I'll have to go get a real

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,640
job again but for now animation so let's

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,170
start with a couple of assumptions today

55
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,640
what you're going to be seeing we're

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,500
using chrome these animations will work

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,980
in all recent browsers including IE 10

58
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,430
ish and 11 IE tens animations can be a

59
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,500
little persnickety will be using

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,750
prefix-free so if you don't see prefixes

61
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,549
its spice lee because i'm using this

62
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,769
handy script by leave ooh what it does

63
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,860
is it goes into your what is it the text

64
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,989
what browser your visitors are using

65
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,750
goes into your stylesheet scans it for

66
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,209
everything that needs a prefix and then

67
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,670
injects new prefix code into the head

68
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,620
it's really nice but I don't recommend

69
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,849
it for production animation or

70
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,500
production development at all because

71
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,049
about once that of every 30 or 40

72
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,780
refreshes the whole thing is borked so

73
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,160
it's much better if you're going to use

74
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,660
prefixes to go ahead and use like

75
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,709
compass with sass and in that I have

76
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,840
actually made an extension called

77
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,420
animation studio which if you like the

78
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,919
techniques you see today this takes a

79
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,329
lot of the math out of them so first off

80
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,010
today I wanted to talk to you a little

81
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,739
bit about this is this talk is super

82
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,389
awesome because it's a compilation of

83
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,090
all of my best of from every other

84
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,280
workshop and talk i have given in the

85
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,739
past year and three months so this is

86
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,599
this is it you guys are going to get it

87
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,329
straight on i'm going to talk to you

88
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,739
about all the different cool things that

89
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,200
come directly from animation that i've

90
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,940
been using and we're going to start with

91
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,430
storyboards now this is a picture I took

92
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,260
and I'm sorry about the glare they had a

93
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,970
lot of LCDs in this room but this is

94
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,209
from the walt disney family museum in

95
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,919
california and this is an example of one

96
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,810
of the world's very first storyboards

97
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,959
storyboards are a recent invention back

98
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,480
in the olden days when disney was just

99
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,859
making little shorts that played before

100
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:06,989
movies they would have a couple of

101
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:08,790
animators that go off into their own

102
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,319
rooms and they work on their things

103
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,060
separately and then they come back

104
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,530
together and it's like I've got a gag

105
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,359
I've got a gag and they'd stitch them

106
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,820
together and then they play that before

107
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,169
a movie and that was all very well and

108
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:21,989
good until they cited to work on Snow

109
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:24,180
White you can have people wandering off

110
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,830
into their separate little coding holes

111
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,280
I'm sorry

112
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,960
animation tables and working on

113
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,520
individual projects and then coming

114
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,380
together because you know this dance

115
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,940
sequence isn't going to flow into that

116
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,210
dwarf sequence at all so they invented

117
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,730
storyboards which were just

118
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,660
illustrations like this pinned to cork

119
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,670
boards that they could lift up and haul

120
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,820
over to another studio plop down and let

121
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,730
new set of animators work on it so

122
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,430
anytime you needed to work with time and

123
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,670
talent it really helped I like to think

124
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,080
of it as prototyping with the fourth

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,830
dimension that is the dimension of time

126
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,350
so now these storyboards are used not

127
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,790
only in animation but they're used in

128
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,440
film they're using an interaction design

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,150
we use them in comics anything that

130
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,950
involves times and teams it's good idea

131
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,110
to bring our storyboard here's an

132
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,660
example of a storyboard I used for a

133
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,310
little music video which I use an

134
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,490
example all the time as you can see I've

135
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,400
got the loading page and exactly what

136
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,710
happens when it's all Illustrated I even

137
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,210
if you click on it have a little

138
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,220
description and image to let people know

139
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,950
exactly what goes where I was the only

140
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,900
person on this team but I still found it

141
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,640
very useful to have all of this

142
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,310
information at my fingertips and I'll

143
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,780
actually show you guys the music video

144
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,630
this is all by the way css3 animations

145
00:05:40,630 --> 00:06:22,080
and html5 audio hang on

146
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,460
and it just loops like that forever I

147
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:33,760
know some people thank you guys so much

148
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,949
so that animation would not be possible

149
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:38,530
without that storyboard I showed you so

150
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,330
they save you time they help you figure

151
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,940
out timing and gives you a great

152
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,530
overview of a project so it's easy to

153
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,840
make changes and helps you break project

154
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,440
down to distribute among steam so you

155
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,479
notice the cat walking out I'm sorry to

156
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,990
say that I did not beat Raavan at being

157
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,550
the first person to show a cat today

158
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,220
which is so sad because it's all about

159
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,400
the cat but anyway let me show you how I

160
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,200
got tuning to walk across the screen

161
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,460
there this is something that in

162
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,040
animation we refer to as the walk cycle

163
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,490
and the walk cycle is oh darn it that's

164
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,710
not the right ah that's not the right

165
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,919
video I had this problem last night and

166
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,020
I thought i fixed it not being my friend

167
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,430
there it is sweet got it and so you see

168
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,110
if you can plane up at the computer long

169
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,410
enough it does what you want so walk

170
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,000
cycles are like the hello world of

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,650
animation when kids go to animation

172
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,210
school they spend like their first year

173
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,680
working on a walk cycle and you're

174
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,330
really proud and excited about it at

175
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,710
first I didn't go to animation school

176
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,620
but i watch the suckers who did and they

177
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,060
get really proud and excited about it

178
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,590
and then a two weeks in there like God

179
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,410
why am I still doing this it's insane is

180
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,800
like 24 frames just to get this to

181
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,680
happen this is a walk cycle and a stupid

182
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,440
escape button you ruin in it so this is

183
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,990
a walk cycle of the rather famous

184
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,970
character rogue from the x-men who

185
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,320
watches the x-men woo and or reads the

186
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,470
x-men yeah whatever alright so this is

187
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,210
from the series x-men evolution which is

188
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,130
a cartoon based on a comic see bleed

189
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,349
over comics tourney and cartoons dreams

190
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:21,610
crushed and she's a character rogue my

191
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,770
favorite character and she's designed by

192
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,050
this that walk cycle was done by master

193
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,610
animator and character designer Steven

194
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,680
Kate Gordon whose work you have seen

195
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,330
many many many times if you've ever

196
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,089
watched cartoons he's big fan of

197
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,769
rotoscoping oddly enough but

198
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:42,459
that is some of his work after you've

199
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:45,819
done one of these you you actually never

200
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:47,559
want to do one again and understand why

201
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,920
so much animation work is out sourced

202
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,480
it's simply not worth the amount of time

203
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,829
it takes a person in a first world

204
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:57,489
country to draw this so here is how I

205
00:08:57,489 --> 00:08:59,679
made that happen that's tuna he's

206
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,389
walking it is strutting it yeah so what

207
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:06,519
is going on under the hood here as you

208
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,259
can see I just have a tuna dip up here

209
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:11,230
oh there's nothing nothing major special

210
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,660
going on there it's all down to the

211
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,119
animations and see if I can make this

212
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:19,179
just a bit prettier is that right that's

213
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:22,089
legible alright so we've got a key

214
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:24,459
frames block down here now how many of

215
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:25,839
you have at least used a key frames

216
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,929
block at least once raise your hands

217
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:30,670
okay I'm getting some depths for the

218
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,759
rest of you guys alright so CSS

219
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,009
animations work like this you define a

220
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,309
key frames block in this case we're

221
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:42,509
using uh we're calling it walk cycle and

222
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:45,639
inside that you define which properties

223
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,410
you want it to start with and which

224
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,699
properties who want it to end within

225
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,639
your zero percent in one hundred percent

226
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,799
locations could also label them start

227
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,569
and finish or start and end something

228
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:58,029
like that i use zero percent one hundred

229
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:58,959
percent because i like working with

230
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,559
numbers so in this case we're just using

231
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,170
a huge background sprite i showed you

232
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,089
yeah well we're only using this side of

233
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:11,499
the backgrounds right you can see that

234
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:13,299
he's got the sitting animation you saw

235
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,639
me using earlier you can stack these

236
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,709
animations so that you can have him go

237
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,869
from walking to sitting here I've got

238
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,689
one that goes between him running and an

239
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,879
actual running sprite over there which I

240
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,199
use in a different one which will

241
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:29,579
probably look at in a few so let's see

242
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:33,299
where'd I go here we go no that's not it

243
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,970
I'll show you that later guys so anyway

244
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,829
you define these basically what we're

245
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:40,119
doing is we're repositioning the

246
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,129
background sprite we're starting with it

247
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,869
at zero zero and then we're jumping all

248
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:47,589
the way down its length now the magic is

249
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:48,880
right here in this little time

250
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,670
function called steps usually when you

251
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,600
define a wat an animation it uses ease

252
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,900
in it's a and you get something like

253
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,030
that which is how very early animations

254
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,720
were done so so a little bit of

255
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,850
animation history there but when we use

256
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,680
steps what's happening is that the

257
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,780
timing function instead of just you know

258
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,280
starting point a and moving everything

259
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,620
to point B it chops up those properties

260
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,500
into in this case 12 different stops and

261
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,660
then it hops between them so you get

262
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,780
this lovely smooth interaction well it

263
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,100
looks smooth because I've designed it to

264
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,050
look smooth you could make it look

265
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,300
choppy I was just talking with Anna and

266
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,400
she turns out that if you look at some

267
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,580
of her examples she uses steps to help

268
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,690
add change sizes and add elements to her

269
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,390
cylinders at the same time if you use

270
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,130
something like linear it would look very

271
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,830
weird while she was doing that so check

272
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:52,090
out those and look for the steps and in

273
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,070
case you want to see how that works it's

274
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,140
basically a name oh I should have

275
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,170
probably shown you guys the duration too

276
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,480
yep so here's the name this is the

277
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,890
duration we want it to run for one

278
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,350
second and how many times we want it to

279
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,100
loop we could just say happened once and

280
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,110
it would do that that I like him to keep

281
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:22,090
walking forever get to you all right so

282
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,460
cutouts this is the best example of

283
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,380
cutouts I could find this is actually

284
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,300
from a demonstration of how flash

285
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,850
animation works but these are different

286
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,680
symbols or sprites that are being

287
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,990
layered to create a face that has eyes

288
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,880
and a nose and a mouth and you can

289
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,650
change the mouth to give the illusion of

290
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,390
speech and there's some blinking eyes

291
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,950
and such and you composite them and you

292
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,660
get this this face that changes so

293
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,070
instead of having to draw that same face

294
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,930
a bajillion different times like we had

295
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,730
to back in the olden days of Steamboat

296
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,100
Willie where Mickey Mouse was moving in

297
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,930
every panel that's because every panel

298
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,180
was a new drawing they weren't doing

299
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,950
anything very economically back in those

300
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,110
days it wasn't until the 1960s that

301
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,240
people started making things using a

302
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,150
technique called

303
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,450
doubts it was a pioneered by a company

304
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,670
called hanna-barbera and it was

305
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,560
originally developed I think in Japan

306
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,040
probably by osamu tezuka a grandfather

307
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,250
or God of all Japanese animation and i'm

308
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,750
going to show you an example of it I

309
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,000
want you to keep an eye on what parts of

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,530
these animations are moving and what

311
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,290
parts aren't we're going to skip ahead a

312
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:32,840
little bit this is Ben all right that's

313
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,100
a bit I think like and here's our chance

314
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,810
still nice transportation sounding

315
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,610
events with the invention of the four

316
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:49,380
engine jet hire one all right here comes

317
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,070
there's not much moving in a look at how

318
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,710
terrible and jolting others the only

319
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,330
part of that animation that's it smooth

320
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,800
is the movement of the mouth when they

321
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,060
had them actually turning and looking

322
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,710
you just see it the animators was like

323
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,340
oh it's just like drawing a walk cycle

324
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,360
why am i working here so anyway by just

325
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,670
moving the mouth you're seeing a lot of

326
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,280
other you're saving a lot of time there

327
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,770
and you'll notice that most characters

328
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,560
from that era have like a collar or

329
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,720
something that chops off their head and

330
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,100
separates it from the rest of their body

331
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,990
so you can have a person standing there

332
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,850
and only their head is moving but it

333
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,790
doesn't look weird it's you want to

334
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,900
learn more about that there's this

335
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,670
really cool video out from the escapist

336
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,800
called the importance of Yogi's collar

337
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,080
which goes into great depth and once you

338
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,610
see it you will never watch cartoons

339
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,010
from your childhood again quite the same

340
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,120
eyes so doing cutouts with CSS I'm going

341
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,670
to show you a sprite I blow it up so as

342
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,500
you can see this is the tuna from the

343
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,330
end of that music video these guys

344
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,910
little head sit on you cute face you

345
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,010
keep mouth right and down here you can

346
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,300
see he's got two slightly different

347
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,880
expressions where he's going to get

348
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,910
lower lids kind of go from this happy

349
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,710
open expression to kind of a grinning

350
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,390
yeah you know what I'm talking about

351
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,390
kind of expression

352
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,630
and these basically what I did was I put

353
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,170
a div over his face and then i use the

354
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,960
steps technique to flick over those

355
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,960
different states come on you there we go

356
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,450
I can show you exactly the code I used

357
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,240
to do that yeah you got the wiggly

358
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,770
eyebrows good kitty so it's just an

359
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,720
expression nested in here and I couldn't

360
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,770
help but this morning when we were

361
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,480
talking about shadow Dom elements I was

362
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,070
like yes I can finally clean up those

363
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,620
horrible horrible stringy divs inside my

364
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,560
animations just put a tuna on the page

365
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,510
and I can keep all that hidden and nice

366
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,640
and tidy I like that nobody will care

367
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,840
but I like that so anyway down here as

368
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,510
you can see it's the keyframe smirk and

369
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,490
the numbers for this one or just a

370
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,230
little bit less pretty than the ones you

371
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,150
saw before because it isn't your

372
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,280
regularly shaped sprite and I have to do

373
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,570
a little bit of finagling to jump

374
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,250
between it without getting strange

375
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:22,060
loopiness woot so scene transitions it's

376
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,440
got to be somebody who watches my little

377
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,310
ponies in here yeah there we go pinky

378
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,460
five all right so she is obviously

379
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,200
fighting what we refer to as an IRA

380
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,970
swipe in animations ah again you're

381
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,060
giving me the wrong video guy yeah it

382
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,110
will come back so anyway scene

383
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,750
transitions there you'll notice like we

384
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,130
you're watching a cartoon especially

385
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,990
they're used a lot in cartoons or in

386
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,150
feature length films especially poorly

387
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,160
directed ones scene transitions are

388
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,930
there to help patch over when you're

389
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,430
trying to move someone from one frame of

390
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,410
rye minor point of reference into a

391
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,550
different point of reference for

392
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,910
instance scene scene transitions usually

393
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,610
signify change and thought narrative

394
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,350
mood time or location and I just wanted

395
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,770
to show you a cute little example of one

396
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,880
hello

397
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,870
an original seat transition interesting

398
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:24,280
they can be really inventive that was

399
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,319
from edit and any which is I never

400
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,510
watched but it's no longer on TV still

401
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,510
pretty good though so I like to think of

402
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,390
them is like a full stop between spends

403
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,250
sentences or like the space between

404
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,960
paragraphs it's a way of saying i have

405
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,180
finished with this idea and i'm starting

406
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,010
a new one please disregard what came

407
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,559
before but keep it in mind let's just go

408
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,050
on to another thing now this is actually

409
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,059
something i would like to see taken into

410
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:51,520
account with more in UI development i

411
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,320
know we use a lot of fade in and fade

412
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,140
outs for user interfaces but if we

413
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,880
thought about it more like a director

414
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,770
thinks about using these transitions i

415
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,150
think we could come up with some more

416
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,610
powerful ways of dragging users out of

417
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,140
their current frame of rhyme which might

418
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,960
be like i'm editing a paper and into a

419
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,460
second frame of mind which is i'm

420
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,040
reading the paper to see if I got all my

421
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,050
edits incorrectly so instead of just

422
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,480
having like a I am typing in the word

423
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,520
processor save and then the page

424
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,080
completely blinks out to a new page

425
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
maybe it would be nice to fade out and

426
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,100
then fade in the new page like you're in

427
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,170
a different frame of mind now that's how

428
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,400
I would think about it so here's exam of

429
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,960
them I want you to spot how many you can

430
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,970
see oh oh no it's not big enough hang on

431
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,750
I've got to make it bigger oh yeah what

432
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,510
is oh no it won't let me login you're

433
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,870
supposed to be in the gigantic version

434
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:56,440
fine come here

435
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,730
so there were a couple of fade outs and

436
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,640
fade ins there we saw that there was the

437
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,100
iris wipe that zoomed in on her and then

438
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,680
we ended up switching over to somebody

439
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,450
else's point of view and then we faded

440
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,190
out so that we could come back to our

441
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,780
original character this is a project

442
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,790
called the black brick road which the

443
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,710
artist and inventor of is over here her

444
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,660
name is Sam egg she's Russian and she's

445
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,790
like she hasn't even graduated from high

446
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,460
school yet it's amazing I am still not

447
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,410
convinced that she's just not some 42

448
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,570
year-old animation troll out there

449
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,850
trying to pull everyone's leg but this

450
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,580
is number 11 of her installment and i

451
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,020
drew this to kind of look like her

452
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,670
because i thought she was super cute and

453
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,320
i wanted to match I made this part down

454
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,500
here but the the rest of her cartoons

455
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,540
are really cool she basically draws

456
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,700
comics and has little interactive bits

457
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,320
and she'd been doing the interactive

458
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,610
bits and flash and putting them on

459
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,040
deviantart com and I'd been following

460
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,390
her work and I was like hey would you

461
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,680
like to collaborate on something because

462
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,090
I see you're using a lot of flash and I

463
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,170
could make something that you know it

464
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,820
could actually read on an iPad this does

465
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,530
look pretty good on an iPad by the way

466
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,610
it's pretty fun and she came back to me

467
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,290
and she said yeah I would love to do

468
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,420
that um here I've got this gigantic

469
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,230
project you take care of it and I did

470
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,650
and I'm really excited that web apps are

471
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,560
becoming more and more widely adopted

472
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,440
kindle fire now accepts web apps on

473
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,330
their store which means you can look

474
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,400
forward to maybe being able to buy the

475
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,580
full version of this isn't as a kindle

476
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,320
fire app one day in the near future I

477
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,180
would like that get her some money for

478
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,150
her efforts so anyway enough showing off

479
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,460
other people's work it's my code it's

480
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,320
her art let's move on oh and basically

481
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,210
for that wormhole you might be wondering

482
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,490
how did I get that iris wipe I banged my

483
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,020
head against that one for a long time I

484
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,930
got really sick of it so basically what

485
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,110
it is is I made this huge image and I

486
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,300
started start with it scaled up so large

487
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,490
that the entire scene fits right in here

488
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,310
and then I just animate the background

489
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,650
scale on it to make it shrink to fit the

490
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,540
entire thing and this is all very

491
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,820
carefully done so that as it scales in

492
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,020
this positions exactly over her it's

493
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,460
fairly simple but not the

494
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,960
sort of thing you'd think about doing

495
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,260
unless you had this particular use case

496
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,320
so let's talk parallax parallax it's so

497
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,940
popular right now but I think it's kind

498
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,450
of overdone but that doesn't matter even

499
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,190
though i think it's overdone everyone

500
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,630
else is excited about it so i'm going to

501
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,120
tell you how it is this machine here is

502
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,880
called a what is it hang on him it a

503
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,230
multi-plane camera and it was invented

504
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,450
by uh it works who actually was the

505
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,240
original animator of Mickey Mouse vault

506
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,340
Disney actually did the studio's did a

507
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,550
lot of innovation for their time in fact

508
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,440
i would even say that the spirit of

509
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,420
animation back during the disney golden

510
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,890
years is not unlike the spirit we are

511
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,270
experiencing in front end development

512
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,880
today a lot of cool new things were made

513
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,020
one of the things they complained about

514
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,320
was when they were doing scenes of like

515
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,840
a sweeping landscape and they wanted to

516
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,520
zoom in on a house or something if there

517
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,500
was a sun or moon or a point of

518
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,690
reference in the distance as a zoomed-in

519
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,690
it got larger too in reality when we

520
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,100
look into the distance the sun doesn't

521
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,530
get bigger it stays the same so they

522
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,510
needed a way to imitate this they needed

523
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,890
a way for things in the foreground to

524
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,120
get bigger without things in the

525
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,190
background getting bigger too so they

526
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,600
could make those wonderful opening

527
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,750
scenes that you saw in in Bambi with and

528
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,890
when you're moving through the forest

529
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,420
and it actually looks like the forest is

530
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,060
moving around you or the the scene where

531
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,560
Peter Pan and Wendy are flying over

532
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,720
London it costs a small fortune to use

533
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,090
this basically what would happen is they

534
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,190
put the very very back background down

535
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,990
here and then they will put different

536
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,790
pains on top of it and each one of these

537
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,320
is a different sheet of glass that had

538
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,970
something painted on it and then they

539
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,950
would meticulously move each of these

540
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,780
there's a camera mounted up top and they

541
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,910
take a photo and they do this over and

542
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,590
over again of course you can do this in

543
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,330
flash no but no trouble at all these

544
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,630
days but back then this was pretty heavy

545
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,270
stuff and they did a great job of it and

546
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,150
then during a hard times they scraped

547
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,920
off all the paint from those glasses and

548
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,050
well very few of the backgrounds from

549
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,590
bambi exists to this day but the

550
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,150
interesting thing is that glass

551
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,490
discolors the paint so they had to use

552
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,110
very special paints that were

553
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,170
particularly keyed to be just bright

554
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,670
enough to offset that discoloration

555
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,640
pending on what what level of a glass

556
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,980
was on was very mathy work so anyway

557
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,690
let's have a look at this in action

558
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,130
because I've been talking about it but i

559
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,720
want to show you it's like I even got

560
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,840
this in German just for you guys it's

561
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,530
the last unicorn this is all parallax

562
00:23:43,530 --> 00:24:33,130
you can feel the majesty

563
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,460
okay we'll put this on your website

564
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,590
don't you and now for some really

565
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,480
obvious examples you can tell them they

566
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,040
weren't quite ready to let go of the

567
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,870
parallax yeah

568
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,720
a few upsets a min disinvited so much

569
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,180
chillin item I know I've let me get site

570
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,570
brothers upstairs I lambast especially

571
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,070
believed I know if dr. D get dis new

572
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,520
Emir he does his dad actually I totally

573
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,320
lied I originally had used the German

574
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,310
version so people will pay more

575
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,810
attention to the parallax and they would

576
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,020
to the dialogue but anyway you could

577
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,430
tell that in the foreground things were

578
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,380
moving slower in the background they're

579
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,500
moving a lot faster that is to give the

580
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,560
illusion of depth and I don't know how

581
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,330
many of you have been to the mountains

582
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,980
or you've scenes like sweeping

583
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,820
mountainous vistas in your life ok it's

584
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,170
something you probably noticed from

585
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,390
taking a drive you'll notice like I was

586
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,650
raised in the Blue Ridge Mountains of

587
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,500
Virginia so I'm used to this scene where

588
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,670
you're driving in a car and the

589
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,990
mountains in the background are hardly

590
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,850
moving at all everything is racing past

591
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,790
around you and I did the same thing for

592
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,530
this particular animation I'll show you

593
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,900
the full the full version if I've got

594
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,530
the time oh I might not so anyway as you

595
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,870
can see cats walking up front and in the

596
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,850
background everything is moving at a

597
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,370
different rate this is simply you've got

598
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,620
a foreground here that's tuna I mean we

599
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,060
got the foreground of the grass running

600
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,500
in front of tuna we got the mid-ground

601
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,300
that contains tuna that's him in the

602
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,280
grass right behind him and then there's

603
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,320
the background and the background is all

604
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,470
those mountains and as you can see let's

605
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,100
see background the background is just a

606
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,710
pile of different mountains layered on

607
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,540
top of each other and they're different

608
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,970
lengths and their background positions

609
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,390
all move over the same period of time I

610
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,970
run this parallax PG keyframe over 40

611
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,540
seconds ad infinitum let me show you a

612
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,030
little diagram of how this works there

613
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,710
we go so as you can see the things in

614
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,150
the background they're shorter so they

615
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,670
take look they have less distance to go

616
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,110
they waddle along and the ones in the

617
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,520
front have to go faster to catch up

618
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,280
reminds you of a planet circling sons in

619
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,080
that regard some physics involved so

620
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,210
let's see you can also do this with 3d

621
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,310
transforms I'm not going to bother to

622
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,300
show you guys that article just yet

623
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,610
there's a really cool example of this

624
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,190
which I may show at the end but I

625
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,510
promised someone I was going to show my

626
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,180
version of Alice in Wonderland so let's

627
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,710
talk cushioning easing timing functions

628
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,540
you will hear these words thrown a lot

629
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,120
they are all exactly the same thing in

630
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,830
animation timing functions when we talk

631
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,260
about css3 animations and transitions we

632
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,310
often talk about timing functions or

633
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,350
easing well in animation and that's

634
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,000
always been called cushioning or I think

635
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,220
one time slowing as in slow in slow out

636
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,130
ease in ease out and here's an example

637
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,290
of well you can think of it this way

638
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,200
when you drop a ball it goes from slow

639
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,270
to fast as it increases its velocities

640
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,590
it falls towards the center of the earth

641
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,240
or whatever the center of gravity on

642
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,350
wherever you're running the experiment

643
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,330
is happening when you think about

644
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,280
rolling a ball across the surface it

645
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,850
slows down because of friction taking

646
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:59,200
away its momentum that is if you try to

647
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,470
do any of these animations using a I'll

648
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,590
show you here's an example of a bouncing

649
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,960
ball animation or where it doesn't start

650
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:16,570
right at all that's linear then you're

651
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:30,490
easing oh my god a little better

652
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,300
are you there that's that's some extreme

653
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:56,030
characterization there I'm going to

654
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,000
leave it on that cuz that's funny

655
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,220
alright so there's a really cool article

656
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,560
about applying that kind of science to

657
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,540
UI design and how you can come up with a

658
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,820
much more natural feeling interface by

659
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,250
keeping in mind that things move in a

660
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,600
certain way we're used to them moving in

661
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,310
a certain way and that kind of subtle

662
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,590
skeuomorphism it really does make a

663
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,240
difference and how well people relate to

664
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,090
a product and I'm going to give you a

665
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,400
little example of this this is just

666
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,970
using transitions to roll a ball as you

667
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,830
can see it's slowing down it's kind of

668
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,350
natural right but I want you to see how

669
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,690
much more unnatural this looks when I

670
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,460
change let's see ball ball ball come on

671
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,090
ball or did I put my transitions and

672
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,840
feel like an old man alright so that was

673
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,820
a nice timing function but if I change

674
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,130
it to linear which just starts the same

675
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,960
rate and ends at the same rate looks

676
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:58,700
very unnatural

677
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,289
and you can even roll your own using

678
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:04,149
this a there are many different kinds of

679
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:05,500
transitions but if you need a very

680
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,570
special kind you can roll your own using

681
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,100
cubic Bezier calm I have actually had to

682
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,730
use this from time to time alright so

683
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,200
before I show you show you my last still

684
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,299
set here so Wyatt kicks ass I've been

685
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:23,590
talking to you a lot about these things

686
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,049
well number one is familiar you already

687
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:27,340
have these tools you already know how to

688
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,899
animate things your front end developers

689
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:31,029
work with CSS all the time is nothing

690
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,769
stopping you from making things move and

691
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:34,210
shake into browser you don't need to

692
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,559
learn actionscript or anything like that

693
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:37,840
CSS is perfectly capable of most of the

694
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,480
things you're going to want to do and

695
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,710
what I've just shown you has helped

696
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,850
these techniques stick in your head

697
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,590
better than if I just showed you a bunch

698
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:49,210
of w3c specs which I'll be honest if I

699
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,230
hadn't been reading them it wouldn't

700
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,659
occurred to me to do that but I wouldn't

701
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:53,980
want everyone to have to read the full

702
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,210
spec to realize what steps exactly does

703
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,539
it's a lot of fun and and lastly I'd

704
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:05,019
like to think that content is so much

705
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:07,899
more than copy the browser is not just a

706
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,269
document reader right now we're doing

707
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,799
all sorts of things with web apps that

708
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,659
really stretch what browsers are capable

709
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,750
of and what they can be expected to do

710
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,159
this is why you really need to be paying

711
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,570
attention to the sorts of things that

712
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,070
you can animate and make move on the

713
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,450
screen it's not enough just to know

714
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,919
typography anymore you have to

715
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,690
understand motion design and interaction

716
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,700
you really do so with these kinds of

717
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,820
skills you can build all kinds of nifty

718
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,610
little things including I promised I was

719
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,320
going to show my version of Alison video

720
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,810
land I mean alison wonderland here it is

721
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,200
it's still in progress so you know

722
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,210
pardon if it looks weird it's just a

723
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:53,990
little something I'm working on

724
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,340
so you can see I I didn't bother to eat

725
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,920
