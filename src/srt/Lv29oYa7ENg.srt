1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,550

reject thank you so much and thank you

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,320
for your patience you know everyone

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,400
loves computers right uh so again my

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,470
name is Jenna zeigen and i'll be talking

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,439
to you about what would happen if your

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,220
brain or literally javascript i'm going

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,500
to keep the suspense a little bit while

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,689
i introduce myself a little bit more so

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,450
i'm an engineering manager at digital

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,309
ocean and the manager of the front-end

11
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,030
team and you might know me as

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,610
eigenvector on twitter the Zygon puns

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,700
don't really go as far here but that's

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,449
cool and if you want to follow along on

15
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,309
your own computers or send these slice

16
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,750
to someone else you can find them at

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,359
jenna is / reject jay s alright so admit

18
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,030
the title of my talk is a little click

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,409
baby baby so our adventure today is

20
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,450
really going to be comparing bits of

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,400
human cognition to bits of JavaScript

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,409
the thing is humans know a lot more

23
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,240
about JavaScript than we know about

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,080
human cognition that's because humans

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,540
made JavaScript but really listen all

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,280
the stuff we know about human cognition

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,829
about how the mind works we really know

28
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,470
from just poking at the human mind with

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,630
experiments therefore we only really

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,150
have theories about how the human mind

31
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,250
works we know really nothing for

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,240
absolute certain there's also a lot of

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,610
different subcategories within cognitive

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,100
science and trying to cover all of these

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,930
things and compare them also javascript

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,939
in 30 minutes would be a little bonkers

37
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,149
uh but also a lot of this is irrelevant

38
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,790
right javascript doesn't perceive it

39
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,439
doesn't make judgments on its own and

40
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,630
it's not conscious and let's hope

41
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,729
javascript never becomes conscious right

42
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,680
but there were a few of these ven I saw

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,569
that had potential to compare to

44
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,760
JavaScript so I chose three of them and

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,560
those are what we'll be covering

46
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,340
day so first and perhaps most obviously

47
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,230
we'll talk about human language as it

48
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,940
compares to programming languages

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,520
secondly we'll talk about human concepts

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,340
and categories of versus javascripts

51
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,170
prototypes and primitives and thirdly

52
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,540
human attention versus the JavaScript

53
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,470
event loop so the most obvious

54
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,470
comparison is comparing javascript to

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,620
human language so there's a pretty

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,269
obvious difference in here right which

57
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:44,400
is that javascript is a programming

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,650
language it's synthetic and human

59
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,170
languages are mostly natural languages

60
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,870
so being that javascript is a

61
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,459
programming language and that is it is

62
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,640
since synthetic it has a lot more

63
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,410
regulation than natural languages so for

64
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,959
JavaScript we have tc39 this standards

65
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,470
body who passed specs hold discussions

66
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,209
on certain things I don't really know

67
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,849
what else they do to be honest but they

68
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,349
help JavaScript stay in line and keep

69
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:16,500
evolving so because of that JavaScript

70
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,109
also evolves a lot faster than human

71
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,420
languages human languages evolve but

72
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,340
it's it's pretty slowly it happens over

73
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,620
hundreds of years and the evolution is

74
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,870
mainly you know we bring in words from

75
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,150
other languages and slaying gets like

76
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,980
kind of more officially in language you

77
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,350
know that moment when on fleek is going

78
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,400
to be in the dictionary um so yeah so

79
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,000
this happens of like slower then how

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,040
JavaScript of JavaScript evolves like

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,450
you might have felt like a taker took a

82
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,630
really long time to past es6 / 2015 spec

83
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,970
but that was pretty short as compared to

84
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,209
natural languages despite all of this

85
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,880
change though human languages are a lot

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,190
harder to learn than programming

87
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,340
languages so you know to become

88
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,500
proficient at a human language takes

89
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,260
years and years and years and it gets

90
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,690
harder and harder as you age after a

91
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,400
certain point when you're really little

92
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,930
called the critical period when you're

93
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,090
kind of like meant to be learning new

94
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,760
languages well with programming

95
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,289
languages i'm willing to bet that the

96
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:21,450
vast majority of us learned her to

97
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,890
program or are learning how to program

98
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,300
as adults

99
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,930
so another big difference that I see

100
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,490
between programming languages and

101
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,139
natural languages that I think is really

102
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,270
cool is that programming languages

103
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,340
create and manipulate the programming

104
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,289
environment rather than just describe it

105
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:40,810
so its language itself that is making

106
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,539
these changes to the environment it's

107
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:45,870
mutating state it's making new objects

108
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,249
but we don't really can't really do this

109
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:51,879
with natural languages I can't say we're

110
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,710
not like wizard Harry Potter I can't say

111
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,870
Akio chocolate bar when we'll fly up to

112
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,129
me on stage and then I could eat it

113
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:00,580
right here in front of you but I have

114
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,289
heard a lot of people talk about how

115
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:04,360
they feel like when their programming

116
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,340
feels like they're doing magic that is

117
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,779
because of the ability for language to

118
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,490
manipulate change and have an effect on

119
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,719
the environment but it's not all pile of

120
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:18,370
differences there are some similarities

121
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,990
between programming languages and

122
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,610
natural languages because they are both

123
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,310
languages so both classes of language

124
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,610
have both syntax and semantics so syntax

125
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,520
is you know what is like what's the

126
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,870
right way to put words together it's

127
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,189
kind of what you're studying when you're

128
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,969
studying grammar so they both have that

129
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:39,099
semantics is the study of meaning so

130
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:40,779
either on a word level or a sentence

131
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:44,050
level so you know lines of code have

132
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,439
meaning you could say that but there are

133
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,289
even still more differences so natural

134
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,419
languages have their own morphology and

135
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,879
phonology while programming languages

136
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,949
don't because these are related to the

137
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,310
natural evolution of languages so these

138
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,139
languages again are evolving naturally

139
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,639
versus the evolution of programming

140
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,349
languages which is more regulated and

141
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:08,169
synthetic Tom or follow G is the study

142
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,419
of the building blocks of words those

143
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,879
prefixes and suffixes the Lego like

144
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,699
kernels of word meaning that may or may

145
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,250
not come from other languages such as

146
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,399
Latin or Greek and phonology is the

147
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,169
study of the way that we pronounce words

148
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:26,649
and the way that they sound and because

149
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,539
a lot of the words that are that are

150
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,399
used in programming languages come from

151
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,050
English if you're going to pronounce a

152
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,789
word if you're gonna pronounce the line

153
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,110
of code out loud it's going to sound

154
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,139
like you're speaking English so

155
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,620
programming languages especially

156
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,910
JavaScript don't have

157
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,810
their own phonology another similarity

158
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,660
is that both programming languages and

159
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,570
natural languages have pragmatics which

160
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,640
is you know what is socially acceptable

161
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,760
or idiomatic within the language these

162
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,530
violations aren't necessarily

163
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,390
ungrammatical per se but they're just

164
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,760
not quite right in programming languages

165
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,700
you you see this in style guides so you

166
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,360
know got your yes Linton JS hint and

167
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,770
stuff so things that come up that aren't

168
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,170
necessarily syntax errors but you might

169
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:16,060
get warned of by these tools so

170
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,670
something that really affects semantics

171
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,270
and pragmatics is context so human

172
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,320
language is highly context-sensitive

173
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,030
while programming languages are less so

174
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,000
so while the equus crypt spec defines a

175
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,160
context-free grammar for its parser it

176
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,690
immediately goes on to say that this

177
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,180
grammar is not sufficiently powerful to

178
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,010
explain if something is valid equi

179
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,720
script however human language really

180
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,020
depends on context and is cannot at all

181
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,940
be described by a context-free grammar

182
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,450
and human language relies on context so

183
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,610
much because human language is filled

184
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,340
with ambiguity either semantics or

185
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,290
syntactic but we don't really ever

186
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,510
notice this and that's because our

187
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,419
brains are so good at using context to

188
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,940
what's called resolve the ambiguities to

189
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,530
find the right meaning the intended

190
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,660
meaning for the words or the syntax

191
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,840
which was used so in an example of a

192
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,990
syntactically ambiguous sentence is I

193
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,780
saw the unicorn with the binoculars so

194
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,210
this can have two interpretations can

195
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,030
either be that I was using a pair of

196
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,080
binoculars to see a unicorn or that I

197
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,270
see a unicorn who owns her own pair of

198
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,780
binoculars so well I mean I think this

199
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,880
is pretty cool that human language can

200
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,099
do this it would be really dangerous for

201
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,099
JavaScript to have syntactic or any type

202
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,960
of ambiguity because you're really

203
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,240
counting on on the consistency and the

204
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,339
repeatability the deterministic of a

205
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:50,410
line of code especially if you're going

206
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,000
to like call different functions in

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,500
certain areas you kind of wanted to

208
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,150
have the same effect whenever you call

209
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:01,090
it right so yeah not so great so its

210
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,610
context that allows human language to be

211
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,850
rich it allows us to do cool things with

212
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,670
language it allows us to make puns which

213
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,650
i think is the favorite type of wordplay

214
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,950
in the JavaScript community you also get

215
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,050
meta meaning from context so the way

216
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,370
that you say something affects its

217
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,070
meaning for example sarcasm we know that

218
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:29,070
everybody loves sarcasm right so uh

219
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,290
human language is messy and it's great

220
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,690
most of the time and javascript is not

221
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,690
that messy and it's also a great most of

222
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,260
the time so one thing that we really

223
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,020
depend on context for is what's called

224
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,570
reference so in human languages these

225
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,690
this comes up as pronouns it's like okay

226
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,640
well yeah it seems like variables could

227
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,500
kind of be a pronoun analog in

228
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,080
programming languages because variables

229
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,589
you define a thing and then you say what

230
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,450
it refers to and then you keep using

231
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,430
that thing that you defined well with

232
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,430
pronouns they refer to something like

233
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,480
otherwise mentioned within a context and

234
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,560
in human languages there's two types of

235
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,660
reference one is called an afro and the

236
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,839
other is called Khafre so in a nephron

237
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,610
seeeeee the thing that you're referring

238
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,860
to comes up before the pronouns so you

239
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,510
see Jenna and talk before she and it in

240
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,040
Katara the pronouns occur before the

241
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,260
things that they're referring to so you

242
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,720
have she and there before Jenna and

243
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,300
Berlin well this is fine for humans

244
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,040
javascript is not super cool with this

245
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,190
right so much so that there's valuable

246
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,960
hoisting that will theoretically fix the

247
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,750
Katara should it occur so it's not in me

248
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,130
and the final parse product or whatever

249
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,089
I saw another form of reference in in

250
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:01,360
JavaScript that was not really just like

251
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,910
distinguished in human language which

252
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,900
was JavaScript's this

253
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,810
so for JavaScript the reference is kind

254
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,520
of implicit you never really officially

255
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,080
define what this is it's just part of

256
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,760
the way the JavaScript works and it's

257
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,310
based on the context and JavaScript

258
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,320
always has this down even if us as

259
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,150
humans reading a program might not have

260
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,650
it completely down you might not know

261
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,820
what this is all the time if you're

262
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,840
reading code um and then if all else

263
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,700
fails JavaScript we'll just all else

264
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,890
fails JavaScript will just say it's in

265
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,050
the it's refers to the global scope

266
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,020
imagine if someone used to pronoun and

267
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,220
you didn't know what it was and you just

268
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,570
figured it referred to the whole world

269
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,860
that would be kind of weird um um

270
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,030
because we don't need this default

271
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,610
because we are capable of following up

272
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,240
and asking what things mean so um we're

273
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,820
much better at error handling so that's

274
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,190
I humans don't make syntax errors like

275
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,000
there's dangling pronouns everywhere but

276
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,920
um it's you know we can say oh like who

277
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,540
did you mean by she and then they'll be

278
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,070
like oh i meant Janice or you didn't

279
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,100
catch that while if this happens

280
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,460
JavaScript would just throw a syntax

281
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,150
error and it wouldn't be that great so

282
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,290
moving on um because we as humans use

283
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,360
language to represent things and

284
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,340
javascript is a language it makes sense

285
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,890
that both human language and JavaScript

286
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,750
deal in this field of concepts and

287
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,970
categories this is also known as

288
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,890
knowledge representation and it is

289
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,550
essential for humans abilities to parse

290
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,530
but then deal with the world and

291
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,380
interact with things if we were to have

292
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,750
a unique way of dealing with every

293
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,730
single object in the world we would fall

294
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,580
over kind of like JavaScript does

295
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,480
encounters a syntax error so we put

296
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,040
things into buckets so we know how to

297
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,280
deal with things generally and this is

298
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,960
how we effectively and efficiently deal

299
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,090
with the world so this is this is called

300
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,890
cognitive economy so an example of what

301
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,720
we might use concepts and categories for

302
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,210
is identifying that this yorkie puppy is

303
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:16,460
a dog and not a cat uh you know this it

304
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,140
could possibly be a cat right it has

305
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,940
some cat-like

306
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,820
features pointy ears it's very kind of

307
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,520
the size of cat four legs and if it

308
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,080
never makes a sound you don't know that

309
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,000
it works but we know it's dog

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,830
automatically there's no problem with

311
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,400
that so for humans a lot of this

312
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,020
concepts and categories stuff is about

313
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,750
object recognition so how do we

314
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,480
recognize and then deal with objects but

315
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,270
again javascript doesn't perceive

316
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,300
because it's a programming language so

317
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,160
like I was like there's got to be

318
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,580
something in here like let me just keep

319
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,140
looking for him right notes so as I was

320
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,700
looking through my cognitive science

321
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,630
notes some words kind of stood out at me

322
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,730
so I was looking at the categorization

323
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,860
theories and there's classical and

324
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,110
prototype theory and then like that

325
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,580
looks familiar as compared to

326
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,720
inheritance architectures um it might

327
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,880
actually be a coincidence these the

328
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,040
words themselves but what is not a

329
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,410
coincidence is that the overall theories

330
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,620
are actually similar this the classical

331
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,080
theory of categorization is very similar

332
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,040
to object inheritance in JavaScript and

333
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,590
some other programming languages this is

334
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,110
because one of the authors one of the

335
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,080
the theorists for this first

336
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,410
categorization theory uh was before he

337
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,030
was working on this cognitive science

338
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,130
stuff he was thinking about how to

339
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,300
organize information within computer

340
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,070
programs he realized that it was most

341
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,780
economical for computers to use

342
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,510
well-ordered hierarchies and then he was

343
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,830
like huh yeah I wonder if this applies

344
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,160
to humans too let's run some experiments

345
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,570
so he and his partner in science came up

346
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,930
with this semantic Network bat which two

347
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,839
test subjects so in this you see

348
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,430
categories are organized in a

349
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,930
hierarchical structure and there's

350
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,990
feature inheritance so to test this they

351
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,640
presented subjects with yes or no

352
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,620
questions and then measured their

353
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,600
reaction time to try and model this

354
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,200
chart in time so they asked those

355
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,960
questions about the pure hierarchy such

356
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,200
as is a canary-bird and is a canary and

357
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,910
animal they also asked questions

358
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,880
about future inheritance so is a canary

359
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,750
yellow and does a canary breathe they

360
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,330
found that true to the chart it took

361
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,610
longer to answer questions that involve

362
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,280
traversing this hierarchy more so it

363
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,830
took longer to answer does a canary

364
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,200
breathe versus is a canary yellow

365
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,830
because yellow is a property on canary

366
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,880
for breathing is a property on animal so

367
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,940
for the most part the subjects had

368
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,740
reaction times that pretty much modeled

369
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,320
this chart and I'm pretty sure that if

370
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,870
we ran JavaScript through the experiment

371
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,820
it would perform like a human because

372
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,750
method dispatch kind of looks like this

373
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,430
but there's starts to break down a

374
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,940
little bit in humans so there's things

375
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,270
called typicality effects so for example

376
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,150
sharks aren't really typical fish so you

377
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,260
know sometimes this gets a little fishy

378
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:35,240
pun call back so it might take longer

379
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,110
for you to verify that a shark is a fish

380
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,490
then it would be to verify that a shark

381
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,830
is an animal this doesn't really follow

382
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,600
that hierarchy right so theorists are

383
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,590
like all right well we got to reevaluate

384
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,480
this and they came up with some new

385
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,370
theories these are more about similarity

386
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,460
than about hierarchy but it's okay

387
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,960
because we're talking about humans and

388
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,810
not about programming languages and so

389
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,900
this I couldn't really find many

390
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,160
similarities in here between this end

391
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,430
and JavaScript except that it seems like

392
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,860
prototype theories kind of more like

393
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,720
classical inheritance an exempt our

394
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,910
theories kind of for like prototype will

395
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,520
inheritance but that's cool whatever I

396
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,830
did learn and I did get out of this that

397
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,140
maybe object orientation is in fact a

398
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,110
good way to structure your programs but

399
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,030
I'm gonna move on before I get rotten

400
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:33,250
tomatoes sworn at me okay so another

401
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,570
subset of study within basic within

402
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,610
concepts and categories is this idea of

403
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,490
basic level categories so this is a

404
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,710
natural level of categorization it's

405
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,760
what we tend to use in

406
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,890
versation to this just right level of

407
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,450
specificity that is usually the

408
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,780
pragmatic choice so if we go back to our

409
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,320
trusty hierarchy chart a bird and fish

410
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,900
would be the basic level categories in

411
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,120
here while animal is the superordinate

412
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,270
category and canary and ostrich would be

413
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,180
these subordinates Atta Gauri's so i was

414
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,610
like huh yeah I kind of see this coming

415
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,300
up in JavaScript to my human brain kind

416
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,710
of thinks that like function and number

417
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,630
these are kind of basic level categories

418
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,610
in in JavaScript so I went back to the

419
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,860
trustee ECMO script spec and lo and

420
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,630
behold I found a list of things that I

421
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,000
saw ha yeah this could be javascripts

422
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,830
basic level categories and I ran them

423
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,080
through and like ok so if they're gonna

424
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,750
be basic level categories well first

425
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,270
object is totally the superordinate

426
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,730
category it's the the top of the chart

427
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,980
so if they're going to be basically at

428
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,580
agura's they're going to have object

429
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,360
like clothes as their prototypes so did

430
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,570
this and then I did that and felt really

431
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,860
silly because of course this is what

432
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,040
happened um but I was like there's

433
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,480
something missing here right like I

434
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,880
thought function like my human brain was

435
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,980
thinking that functions were a basic

436
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,600
level and what about arrays and even

437
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,820
date and promise um so I read the spec a

438
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,890
little more and found them in a list

439
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,270
that also included all the

440
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,180
aforementioned things the previous list

441
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,340
and this list was well known intrinsic

442
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,080
objects so these are things that are

443
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,750
explicitly referenced by algorithms of

444
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,920
this specification and I did more

445
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,420
science on these and some of these make

446
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,800
sense uh I wouldn't argue like but other

447
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,820
ones so like array is in here but also

448
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,250
float32 array and my human brain is like

449
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,990
well for raised in there float32 array

450
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,640
is not a basic level but um javascript

451
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,960
is a programming language doesn't have

452
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,510
to think like a human so if it wants to

453
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,470
have a

454
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,350
level category system than a human would

455
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:06,870
that's cool uh so thus far we've been

456
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,750
focusing on language and representation

457
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,299
but what happens if we think of the

458
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:15,600
JavaScript runtime as a mind and compare

459
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,860
from that angle so there are a bunch of

460
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,210
metaphors that cognitive scientists will

461
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,780
use to explain attention so one of them

462
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,440
is attention as a filter so you know

463
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,990
your attentional system is going to put

464
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,059
everything through like a sieve and only

465
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,169
the important stuff is going to fall out

466
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,520
and that's what you're going to pay

467
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,830
attention to another metaphor is

468
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,530
attention as a spotlight so the

469
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,450
important stuff is highlighted and

470
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,730
everything else falls to the wayside so

471
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,799
you only pay attention to the stuff that

472
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:53,280
is under a spotlight there's another

473
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,020
metaphor which is attention is glue

474
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,700
which is a little into the weeds of

475
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,780
cognitive science so there's some

476
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,340
theorists that think that when we

477
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,210
perceive we perceive these like object

478
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,030
features and then its attention that

479
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,080
binds them together into a discrete

480
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,909
object and then lastly there is another

481
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,970
metaphor of attention as control so this

482
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,559
control is blocking out unwanted

483
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,799
distractions and automatic processes so

484
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,049
an example of how attention works as

485
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:30,000
executive control is this thing called

486
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,890
the Stroop task which you might have

487
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,890
seen in those email chains of your I

488
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,200
serve with this you're supposed to say

489
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,820
the color that the word is written in

490
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,309
and not read the word itself but this is

491
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:43,350
really hard because reading has become

492
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,559
an automatic process for us as we get

493
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,480
older so it's really hard to not read

494
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,289
the word and to say the color instead so

495
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:54,780
um none of these really applied to

496
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,720
JavaScript because they're about a 10

497
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,080
about perception and JavaScript again

498
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,309
doesn't perceive because it's a

499
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:04,830
programming language and JavaScript also

500
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,630
doesn't have automatic processes like we

501
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,750
have like for example reading I was like

502
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,460
well there's gotta be something here and

503
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:11,970
then

504
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,190
I remember this kind of back-channel

505
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,280
metaphor which is attention as threads

506
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,840
all right so we kind of think about

507
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,710
threads at least I do as multitasking

508
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,360
but yeah so we can extrapolate and use

509
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,070
this metaphor of attention as threads

510
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,020
but humans are really bad at

511
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:36,150
multitasking um there's a bunch of

512
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,130
studies that have shown this one of them

513
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,860
is an inattentional blindness study so

514
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,780
I'm just remembering this particular

515
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,190
video that they showed me in my

516
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,890
cognitive science class I'm not going to

517
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,450
spoil it in case you want to go and

518
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,420
watch it on YouTube but the premise is

519
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,170
that they tell you to you know count the

520
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,850
number there's two teams passing the

521
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,930
ball back and forth and you're supposed

522
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,870
to count the number of times that only

523
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,970
one team catches the ball I think it's

524
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,970
the White team and if you actually focus

525
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,960
on the task I guess watch the video if

526
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,330
you want but the thing is it proves that

527
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,520
you're really bad at paying attention to

528
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,110
things or noticing things you're not

529
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,370
actually paying attention to so you

530
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,870
can't really multitask there's another

531
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,390
study which is called the dichotic

532
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,240
listening task in which your subjects

533
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,220
were presented with two speech streams

534
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,350
one in one year and one in the other and

535
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,150
they're supposed to only pay attention

536
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,580
to one and maybe do a task such as

537
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,920
saying take back the words that were

538
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,050
spoken in one year so to make sure that

539
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,340
you're actually paying attention to only

540
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,460
that but and then they were asked

541
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,990
questions about the other speech dream

542
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,310
and the other ear and they they're

543
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:51,150
remembered very very little whether it

544
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,700
was like gibberish they didn't even

545
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,620
notice that there's no semantic

546
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,480
information that goes through my

547
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,010
favorite was one of the studies

548
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:04,350
presented they spoke check in an

549
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,660
American accent to American subjects and

550
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,040
they didn't even realize that it wasn't

551
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,480
English there's like oh yeah everything

552
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,160
was good I just don't remember what what

553
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,030
the actual content was so you could be

554
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:20,370
really only can focus on one thing but

555
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,530
there's some light from some experiments

556
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,240
about exactly what's going on with our

557
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,650
inability to multitask

558
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,710
so they found that if you're presented

559
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,460
with two simultaneous activities but in

560
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,730
different modalities so for example

561
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,230
linguistic versus visual so words and

562
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,810
pictures you've more of a chance of

563
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,230
remembering both things are being able

564
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,960
to attend to both things so if you're

565
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,780
supposed to shadow or repeat back words

566
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,270
subjects are able to recall information

567
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,510
presented in pictures better than they

568
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,950
were able to remember information

569
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,440
presented in printed words and then they

570
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,000
were still really bad at remembering any

571
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,020
information spoken to them while doing a

572
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,500
shadowing task so this brings to brings

573
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,720
up this idea of task specific resources

574
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,300
or multiple capacity theory that it's

575
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,980
really enough that we can't multi tasks

576
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,930
that we can't do too many we have us

577
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,820
we've came to too many tasks with Jin

578
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,670
within one like modality silo so you

579
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,140
can't do too many things at once that

580
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,000
involve words you can't do too many

581
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,410
things that involve visual tasks so it's

582
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,480
just all about balancing all that if you

583
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,300
really want a multi task JavaScript just

584
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,280
can't it's just good can't multitask at

585
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,690
all right because it's it's single

586
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,740
threaded so if we're actually talking

587
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,510
about the JavaScript runtime and

588
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,490
thinking about the event loop as

589
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,460
attention javascript will only do one

590
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,210
thing for you at once but javascript is

591
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,130
asynchronous it's really just calling

592
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,920
out to other api's and if we're just

593
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,960
talking about javascript those dumb

594
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,510
browser Steve API is even web workers

595
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:01,800
don't really count so JavaScript only

596
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,820
has one capacity being JavaScript all

597
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,300
right so I had a relief uh I really

598
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,040
enjoyed going through and comparing

599
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,940
JavaScript to human cognition I've never

600
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,710
ever thought I would read the akwa

601
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,080
scripts back but I did or at least parts

602
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,530
of it and um I learned some new things

603
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,600
about human cognition too even though it

604
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,500
was my major in University uh so um I

605
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,480
hope that you are in some things too and

606
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,090
that you can use it to better your

607
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,660
JavaScript skills um thanks for

608
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,970
listening I will tweet the slides feel

609
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,389
free to

610
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,549
tweet questions at me too or sing my

611
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:44,549
praises or whatever alright thanks again
