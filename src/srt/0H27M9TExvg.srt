[Applause]

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,570
okay thank you thanks to that yes well

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,210
thanks everybody for being here well

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,650
this morning or this afternoon it's 12

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,310
so I don't know how but so this title is

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,230
this talk is about textile based

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,720
interactions in JavaScript so this talk

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,699
is not really about what you should do

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,130
or what you will do there's more about

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,800
what you can a lot of the times when

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,900
we're are conferences we talk about the

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,719
future of interfaces like with react or

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,059
web components or the new web api's or

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,829
things like that but this talk is more

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,110
about the other side of the interface

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,790
the actual thing that you can use to

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,180
interact with it so I already got

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,920
introduced but my name is Charlie Gerard

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,570
I'm a front-end developer I live in

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,079
Sydney in Australia and outside what I'm

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,280
going to talk about today has nothing to

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,620
do with what I do for work but outside

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,039
of that I'm also part of Google

24
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,030
DevExpress delight tech speakers I know

25
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,239
that there's a few around at this event

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,559
so if you have any question about how to

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,880
get into these programs or what they are

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,360
feel free to come talk to me afterwards

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,950
yes so what we're going to talk about

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,540
today is not about me but it's about

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,150
textile interfaces so what does it

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,130
actually mean just a quick definition

33
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,560
it's using textile as an input to

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,280
interact with interfaces and or devices

35
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,930
so the main inspiration for this talk is

36
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,280
actually something that I came across

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,950
about three or four years ago

38
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,619
that's called a project jacquard so for

39
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:32,970
those of you who don't know what this is

40
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,100
this is a collaboration between Google

41
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,700
and Levi's so the brand of jeans to

42
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,979
create a connected jacket so instead of

43
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,360
just spending some time explaining tick

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,520
to you I'm just gonna play the I'm just

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:53,490
gonna play video okay why so there is no

46
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,990
video great so there was a video five

47
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,130
minutes ago and now there's no video

48
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,460
anymore

49
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,869
so I'm just going to talk about what the

50
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,409
video shows so Google partnered with

51
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,869
Levi's to embed a jacket with

52
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,759
electronics so that you could interact

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,190
with your phone while you're riding a

54
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,020
bike so if your phone rings and you're

55
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,060
supposed to you don't want to take the

56
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,590
call you could just

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,540
touch the fabric and it would it would

58
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,010
send a signal to your phone and you

59
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,390
would have you be able to interact with

60
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,340
a few different interfaces with that you

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,620
could switch the music or get the next

62
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,150
direction from google map just by

63
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,200
interacting with the jacket and after I

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,930
saw things like that I was like to me it

65
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,160
was brand-new at the time like three

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,209
four years ago I didn't really know how

67
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,239
to make this and I go be like I got

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,800
really interested into understanding and

69
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,330
this talk is about how you can actually

70
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,940
build something similar while just being

71
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,310
a JavaScript dev so why am I actually

72
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,080
talking about this there's a few reasons

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,049
so the first one is the evolution of

74
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,510
interactions we still most of the time

75
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,610
interact with technology using a laptop

76
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,880
or our mobile phone but there's more

77
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,560
like we can see some people start using

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,959
voice interaction people have tried VR

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,269
or AR and I do believe that there is

80
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,130
some potential in textile interactions

81
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,049
as well and as technologists I think

82
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:08,549
it's our role to we don't have to build

83
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:09,989
these things but at least keep in touch

84
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,480
with what's going on I know the reason

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,250
is that it's a lot of exciting

86
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,530
possibilities hopefully you'll feel the

87
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,180
same way at the end of that talk as well

88
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,790
but I know that in technology well in

89
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,160
our job we build things that people will

90
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,750
use for money and things like that but

91
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,269
to me technology has a lot more exciting

92
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:29,310
opportunities and that's why I love this

93
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,170
industry and I'll show you a little bit

94
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,150
what you can do with textile and then

95
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,410
finally and that's a personal challenge

96
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,530
is to identify what you can come across

97
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,620
online when you look at innovative

98
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,120
innovations so every time that I come

99
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,440
across something that I don't really

100
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,720
quite understand I don't want to just

101
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,910
look at it and not figure out how to

102
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,720
build it myself

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,700
I don't want to think that you have to

104
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,380
have a PhD to build certain things or

105
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,540
you have to be backed by Google or

106
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,060
Facebook I believe that everything that

107
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,530
we see we might not understand at first

108
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,260
there is a kind of cheap hockey version

109
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,019
that we can do at home without having to

110
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,549
think that you have to work for Google

111
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,519
for to do stuff like that so now we

112
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:09,989
let's talk quickly about the potential

113
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:12,690
of textile so first of all it's flexible

114
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,519
when we think about our laptop or our

115
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,560
phone is quite rigid if you try to bend

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,060
it well it's going to break but with

117
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,130
textile when you embed electronics in it

118
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,930
you actually can well it's quite

119
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,880
flexible so you won't you have less

120
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,940
chances of breaking it easily

121
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,290
very lightweight most of the time we

122
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,550
don't even realize that we're wearing

123
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,110
clothes by the way it textile doesn't

124
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,640
have to be clothes it could be this

125
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,740
textile on the table here you have

126
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,570
curtains at home or towels or blankets

127
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,480
or pillows or whatever it's in the end

128
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,340
we don't really look at it that way we

129
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,840
kind of just take it as well it's

130
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,520
textile it just covers our body but it's

131
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,470
actually a lot of potential there as

132
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,360
well and it for it being lightweight it

133
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
means that we would maybe be able to

134
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,710
kind of walk around without having to

135
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,080
carry a heavy phone or a heavy laptop I

136
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,120
started speaking at conferences last

137
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
year and even if I try to travel light

138
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,620
at the end my luggage is or my backpack

139
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,180
is actually quite heavy because of the

140
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,130
laptop and the phone and stuff like that

141
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,200
so being able to embed that kind of

142
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,270
interactions into textile means that we

143
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,030
could actually travel even a lot lighter

144
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,520
it is quite modular so if you want to

145
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,140
build your own things you can add

146
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,340
different components you could add

147
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,830
lights or flex sensors or all that stuff

148
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,020
and you get to build it yourself so you

149
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,150
rather you get to decide where you want

150
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,800
it to be if even if it was on a t-shirt

151
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
it could be the shoulders or the back or

152
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,490
whatever so you don't have to actually

153
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,830
buy something as it is like the phone

154
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,360
you know I mean well Google I think was

155
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,770
working on a modular phone but in

156
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,140
general when you buy a piece of tech

157
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,970
it's kind of like you know you just buy

158
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,990
it and that's the way it is and you

159
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,430
don't get to decide what parts you want

160
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,560
but by building your own textile

161
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,240
interfaces you get to decide the

162
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,680
interaction and the sensors that you

163
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,800
want to embed in it it's responsive to

164
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,260
adaptive touch so this is in this talk I

165
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,730
kind of had to made up make up some

166
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,730
words because so adaptive touch is well

167
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,900
that I made up because I didn't really

168
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,310
know how to explain what I wanted to say

169
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,040
so adaptive touch what I mean Dada is

170
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,310
that so when you for example for the

171
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,390
jacket by Google you interact with it

172
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,400
and it sends a signal but adaptive touch

173
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,750
means that you don't have to press it

174
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,520
very hard to then send a signal you can

175
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,230
even just slightly touch it and you

176
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,430
could have different interactions based

177
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,980
on how you decide to touch the jacket so

178
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,470
this is what I mean by adaptive touch it

179
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,690
is very low-power if you've been playing

180
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,220
a bit with Arduino or Raspberry Pi

181
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,050
depending on the amount of components

182
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,940
that you have in your circuit it's not

183
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,169
something that you'll have to recharge

184
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:32,490
every day like you do with your phone

185
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,250
and then finally it's pretty cheap so

186
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,050
I'll cover that a bit later as well but

187
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,800
if you compare the price of

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,080
a Macbook - something that you can do

189
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,490
well obviously you will do a lot less

190
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,960
with interactive test I'll let you do

191
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,539
with your laptop but it's to get started

192
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,330
in that space you don't have to spend a

193
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,240
lot of money okay so how does it

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,330
actually work at the core of it is

195
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,460
conductive thread so this is normal

196
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,110
thread that it makes that is mixed with

197
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,120
stainless steel so it means that it

198
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,860
carries the current through a circuit

199
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,000
the same way that Y is do so again well

200
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,900
I don't know if you've been playing with

201
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,270
Arduino but usually you connect your

202
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,009
microcontroller and your sensors with

203
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,349
wires in between and you can do exactly

204
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,440
the same with conductive thread the main

205
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,150
difference though is that usually wires

206
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,460
are coated like they're wrapped into

207
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,599
some kind of plastic so you don't really

208
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:23,889
interact with them whereas the

209
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,199
conductive thread it's bare and as your

210
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,150
body conducts electricity as well it

211
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,550
means that when you use conductive

212
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,159
thread in your circuit you can know the

213
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,020
kind of like electric charge that goes

214
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,370
in a circuit and as soon as we interact

215
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,840
with it so as soon as you touch the

216
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,759
thread you have a change in this

217
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,289
electric charge in a circuit that you

218
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:43,870
can track and then use that as as an

219
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,830
input for your interfaces and devices so

220
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,229
this is like the latest version of the

221
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,630
one of the things that I built so I'm

222
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,740
just going to go through a little bit

223
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,090
about how it works and the modules that

224
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,729
you have to use to do that so I built it

225
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,199
three different times that's just the

226
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,630
latest last one you don't have to build

227
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,860
it that way if you're interested there's

228
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,539
a few different microcontrollers that

229
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,819
you can use or things like that but at

230
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,460
the core of it is a flora board the

231
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,500
reason I used that one is because it's

232
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,210
good for wearables if you look at all

233
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,340
the holes around the board they are big

234
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,889
enough to have to be able to put a

235
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,930
needle through them so at first I didn't

236
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,270
know and I worked with another board

237
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,529
that wasn't made for wearables and I

238
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:24,699
realized a bit too late that I couldn't

239
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,080
even put the thread through the hole so

240
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,300
they was trying to use this so if you

241
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,740
want to do wearables I think the flora

242
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,010
is a good one then I I did a Bluetooth

243
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,990
module because I didn't want to have to

244
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,729
be tethered to my computer obviously I

245
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,740
want to be able to walk around and be in

246
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,209
the street or whatever and communicate

247
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:43,320
to my phone or my laptop via bluetooth

248
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,350
then you have high level resistors I'm

249
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,970
not going too much into that but to be

250
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,640
able to filter through and get data from

251
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,900
the amount of touch the capacitive

252
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,780
sensing you have to use resistors then I

253
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,870
have two pieces of thread and finally a

254
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,210
battery to make it totally portable okay

255
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,020
it's 48 dollars so when you want to buy

256
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,450
all these components online it would

257
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,810
only be about 48 dollars so when I was

258
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,280
preparing this talk I realized that

259
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,990
Google actually partnered with another

260
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,120
brand called Santo ha to make a backpack

261
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,280
so now they also have an interactive

262
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,020
backpack but the thing that looked at it

263
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,440
after and I was like 685 pounds are you

264
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,630
for real and I'm like normally you do

265
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,860
that for 80 48 dollars

266
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,890
so it is the instead of instead of

267
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,960
having to buy something that is super

268
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,490
expensive you could actually start

269
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,620
playing with that technology and put

270
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,050
like interactive stuff in your backpacks

271
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,820
or accessories or whatever for a lot

272
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,110
cheaper ok so in terms of code now we

273
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,420
assembled the whole auto Hardware

274
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,430
together so it can't you can't do

275
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,170
everything in JavaScript so that's a bit

276
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,840
of Arduino but I'm gonna go through it

277
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,100
line by line I mean red block by block

278
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,500
so it is a that's pretty much all the

279
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,580
code that you need to upload to the

280
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,280
Arduino what's going on here is that we

281
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,860
accentuate the Bluetooth communication

282
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,750
we use there is a capacitive sensor

283
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,640
library for Arduino so you don't have to

284
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,130
write it yourself you just create two

285
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,690
capacitive sensors for the two pieces of

286
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,880
threads that I used and we use a

287
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,690
threshold so as I said in in circuit

288
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,760
there is always an electric charge but

289
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,320
you want to be able to track when you're

290
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,610
touching it so you put a certain

291
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,290
threshold so that when it's over this

292
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,810
one is a thousand but you could decide

293
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,860
whatever you want really based on the

294
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,990
attraction that you want the as soon as

295
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,370
the value coming back from the Arduino

296
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,870
will be over a thousand it means I'm

297
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,640
touching a piece of thread so do

298
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,430
something in the browser the main the

299
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,050
setup function that runs once when you

300
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,180
upload your code to the Arduino you just

301
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,380
kind of reset the value of your

302
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,570
capacitive sensor you set the Bluetooth

303
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,960
mode to data that you know it's with the

304
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,030
library so that you don't yeah it's fine

305
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,580
and then the loop function is going to

306
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,920
run continuously and what you do you

307
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,080
just read the value from the two pieces

308
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,880
of thread and then as soon as they're

309
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
above a threshold you send that via

310
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,899
bluetooth so in just a few

311
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,430
of course you have the capacitive

312
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,740
sensing running on the Arduino and now

313
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,959
what we have to do is deal with it in

314
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,540
the front end so as i said i'm using

315
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,699
bluetooth so i decided to be able to

316
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:17,230
connect to the browser using web

317
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,410
Bluetooth so what we're gonna do here is

318
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,050
we have the name of our of our device

319
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,230
that's called the Adafruit bluefruit le

320
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,429
you can reset that name if you don't

321
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:28,480
want to call it that way but that will

322
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,379
be on the arduino side you so for web

323
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,209
Bluetooth it works all the Bluetooth

324
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:35,980
protocol works with services and

325
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,959
characteristics so they have certain new

326
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:40,149
ideas that you have to use to be able to

327
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:42,699
connect to and for web Bluetooth knew

328
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,350
you for security reasons you have to

329
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,569
start the connection to a device with

330
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:48,339
user input so you can't just run your

331
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:49,329
browser and it will connect straight

332
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,429
away so let's say on webpage we have a

333
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:53,290
button and as soon as we click we're

334
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,449
going to request nearby devices and we

335
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,189
add a few options to filter down the

336
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,420
device that we want to connect to so

337
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,119
that would be our Adafruit module and

338
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:03,939
the services that we want and then

339
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:06,220
finally we connect to it we get the

340
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,269
primary service we get the

341
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,160
characteristic and at that time here

342
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,199
we'll start to get the data from the

343
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,550
arduino so we call the start

344
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,629
notification method on on the

345
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:18,850
characteristic to start getting the data

346
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,529
every time it changes from the arduino

347
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,019
so every time that the data that yes

348
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:25,029
that the data from my touch is changing

349
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:27,759
i actually have an event listener and i

350
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,470
get that and i have to decode it so at

351
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,329
that moment here we're just getting a

352
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:33,730
certain value in the browser and then we

353
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,199
decide to do with it at the moment it

354
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,139
will just be an integer and this is

355
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,759
where we could to decide the type of

356
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,129
interaction that we want to have so

357
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,139
let's talk about the interactions if we

358
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,910
consider again that have a piece of

359
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,769
fabric and i have two conductive threads

360
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,410
on it we could create an interaction of

361
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,779
swiping down i know if i get the value

362
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,730
of thread one at thread two in the order

363
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,399
obviously I'm swapping down and then you

364
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,389
could have reversed you could have

365
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,399
swiping up so if I touch the bottom

366
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,230
thread first and the top one later it

367
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,660
means I'm going up then you could have a

368
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,999
tap or a touch times two because we have

369
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,319
two different threads so if I'm only

370
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:09,910
touching the first one maybe do

371
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,110
something if I'm only touching the

372
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,240
second one do something else then you

373
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,189
could have a double tap so if over time

374
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:18,100
I touched if for example in half

375
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,079
second I get value from the bottom

376
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,149
thread twice it means I'm doing a double

377
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,649
tap and things like that

378
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,380
and finally we could have pressing the

379
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,319
both threads at once so with only two

380
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:30,880
pieces of conductive thread we could

381
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,829
already have seven possible interactions

382
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:35,079
of ways of things that we could do in

383
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,089
the browser or with a device so I'm

384
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:41,199
going to try and show you how it works

385
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,490
so now all the demos are going to be

386
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,740
live because I think I couldn't really

387
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,779
bring everything but so the first thing

388
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,899
that I built was just I tried to augment

389
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,000
my couch with conductive right so I

390
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,670
wanted to be able to switch songs on

391
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,759
Spotify by just touching the thread so I

392
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,410
don't know it looks like videos and not

393
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,079
okay so I don't really know okay so well

394
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,160
that's not the slider you can watch

395
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,509
later so what was supposed to happen

396
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:08,680
here is that I when I'm touching threads

397
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,019
one by one I would switch the song to

398
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,730
like the previous one or the next one

399
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,190
and if I'm touching them if I'm touching

400
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,690
a piece of thread long enough the volume

401
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,870
goes up or goes down so yeah if you're

402
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,220
interested in watching it's like a

403
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,680
10-second video anyway but you can do

404
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,089
that later I have no idea whether video

405
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,579
work but so the second one I'm gonna

406
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:30,420
dive a bit more into is this example

407
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,759
that was when Google was working on

408
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,689
project jacquard they also showcased

409
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:39,220
that at a conference so people could try

410
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,380
the fabric and have that visualization

411
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,189
and at the time I only knew that I was

412
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:46,810
only thinking about simple interactions

413
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,670
so like oh if I touch one piece of

414
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,170
thread do something or the other one but

415
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,399
this one I was quite interested because

416
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,110
I was thinking how do they get the

417
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,850
location of where I'm touching and

418
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,139
things like that so I built a very like

419
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,110
it's not as good right but the it kind

420
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,939
of works so I'm gonna try to demo it

421
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:05,199
live and then I'll explain a little bit

422
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,029
how it works because I feel like in

423
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:08,470
terms of reverse engineering that was

424
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,470
very interesting to work on so now is

425
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,449
the time where hopefully I tested it

426
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,199
like many times so okay yes okay so I'm

427
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,689
just gonna run my server so for this

428
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,480
particular for this particular example

429
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,550
I'm not doing Bluetooth because I had a

430
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,569
lot of issues with Bluetooth at

431
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:31,630
conferences so this one is tethered to

432
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:31,810
the

433
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,890
that's my first prototype so if I touch

434
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,740
yay okay so if I saw well its reverse

435
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,779
for you the where I'm touching baby

436
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,820
Seacliff I'm touching on the bottom left

437
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,520
I should do yeah bottom left if I go to

438
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,380
the top right yeah well that was a bit

439
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,040
of a bug here but if I go in the middle

440
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,480
you can actually well that's just a

441
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,589
visualization it doesn't really do

442
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:55,450
anything but it means that it's just a

443
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,010
piece of thread like I could just like

444
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,970
flick it around what this wires

445
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,620
everywhere so I'm not gonna do that but

446
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,750
it's very like I can fold it like I it

447
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,550
was in a really tiny bag in my luggage

448
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,240
and well I I only did a visualization

449
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,440
because I wanted to reproduce what

450
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,760
Google did but you could really do

451
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,100
anything with it you could turn it into

452
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,460
a MIDI controller for life Cheers

453
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,160
but yeah I know I've been trying to join

454
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,390
last year's for a while but they don't

455
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,089
think I'm cool enough so maybe if I make

456
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:24,910
them a textile media controller maybe

457
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,110
that will work

458
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,080
yes so now let's go just a little bit

459
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,390
quickly into how how many it happen so

460
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,120
instead of just sewing threads just like

461
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,520
horizontally just like separately I

462
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,120
turned them into a matrix so agreed and

463
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,320
one thing that is really important is

464
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,050
that the thread should not touch so when

465
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,820
a piece of thread goes over the fabric

466
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,520
the one that is on the y-axis should

467
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,980
actually go under the reason for that is

468
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,080
because if you're touching one piece of

469
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,820
thread and that piece of thread touches

470
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,320
another piece of piece of thread then

471
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,440
your reading is going to be wrong so I

472
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,660
do edit it in terms of a matrix because

473
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,040
all of a sudden your threads can be

474
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,589
changed into coordinates obviously you

475
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,480
want to be mapping where you're touching

476
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,100
the thread to a location on the screen

477
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,010
so your vertical threads could be X 0 X

478
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,250
1 X 2 and then y 0 y 1 y 2 for this

479
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,439
particular example I only used six

480
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,449
pieces of threads but you could see that

481
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,370
because I did it manually and there

482
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,780
already took me a while so if I had a

483
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,939
swing machine I could actually do a lot

484
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:30,670
bigger and better stuff but what is

485
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,110
going on after that is that when you're

486
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,950
touching for example the top left corner

487
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,660
you get data so you could be like okay I

488
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,900
get a value from my first thread my

489
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,310
first vertical thread I get a value from

490
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,830
my first horizontal thread so I could be

491
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,720
that the

492
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,690
is then x0 and y0 and then with

493
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,520
coordinates you could you could add that

494
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,260
to canvas in the browser and stuff like

495
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,870
that so for example that as I showed

496
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,330
here as I'm touching the middle thread

497
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,390
and the bottom thread like vertically

498
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,270
presently I apply that to then my

499
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,520
visualization in the browser yes and

500
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,230
then you could actually also have that's

501
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,940
the second made-up turn temporal

502
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,500
gestures it's not lip smart I was I

503
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,120
don't know how to call it so but if it

504
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,950
sounds madam I'll take it

505
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,580
so here when I showed you the demo I was

506
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,440
just touching one at a time and it was

507
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,870
impacting the visualization but you

508
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,270
could assert you could program swipes

509
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,610
like I said before and the way you would

510
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,190
do that is you would track data that you

511
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,830
get over time for example over half a

512
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,080
second or over a second you would push

513
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,000
everything into an array and then every

514
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,919
second or every half a second you would

515
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,780
check okay if the first value in my

516
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,740
array was X 0 Y 2 and then the last

517
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,809
would be X 2 y 2 then it means I'm

518
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:51,000
swiping right and you know the opposite

519
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,530
for swiping left you could do up and

520
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,299
down and things like that so then you

521
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,820
could create a lot of different gestures

522
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,020
that would mean different things so even

523
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,299
with only six pieces of threads you

524
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:01,559
could actually have quite a lot of

525
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,000
different ways to interact with an

526
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,270
interface and okay this is not me but I

527
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,940
wish it was me and that uses the same

528
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,710
principle so but it's a lot it's not

529
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,600
done by hand you can see that it uses a

530
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,330
machine and the reading is really really

531
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,669
good so it is a great agreed as well and

532
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:20,880
the where you're touching on an X and Y

533
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,669
axis is then showed by lighting up

534
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:26,340
certain squares on the screen so I put

535
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,100
the link to the blog where there's like

536
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,809
a lot of different other interactions

537
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:32,130
that you can do a six style so you can

538
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,840
check that afterwards but ultimately

539
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,700
that's kind of what I would like to be

540
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,490
building because it's also like a super

541
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,620
lightweight and it's like on your skin

542
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,270
so you could really just interact with

543
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,740
interfaces with that so that's really

544
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,530
cool different a few different

545
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,059
applications this is where I wish the

546
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,059
videos were working but okay so

547
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,710
accessories so as I one of my prototype

548
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,080
that I built was to augment a couch but

549
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,000
you or you have some brands that are

550
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,809
already working on accessories

551
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:01,480
wanted with interactive textile this

552
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,399
brand has a pair of speakers and instead

553
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:04,299
of having buttons

554
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:06,429
it's a textile that you can press a

555
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:09,159
certain way to trigger our next song put

556
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,360
the volume up or down and things like

557
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:18,080
that you can make musical instruments so

558
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,440
so I don't know if you heard of the meme

559
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,450
gloves I think it's a project that

560
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,820
started about seven or eight years ago

561
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,730
by an artist called Imogen Heap and she

562
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,559
also has a team of engineers that have

563
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,860
been building these musical globes so on

564
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,480
top of having conductive thread it's

565
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,919
also gloves that are embedded with

566
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,470
flexed senses and position senses so if

567
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,149
you are interested I really I really

568
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:41,740
advise me to actually watch that video

569
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,929
after it's really really cool so by just

570
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:45,730
being on stage and moving hands a

571
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,320
certain way you can change the frequency

572
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,470
or the beat or the instrument and and

573
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,809
that's a good total new way of having of

574
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:56,009
playing music of having keys

575
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:59,049
accessibility so this project is it has

576
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,379
the same concept where a pair of clothes

577
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:05,259
is embedded with Flex senses and it's

578
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:07,360
just a team of students who have been

579
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,610
working on training machine learning

580
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,159
model to recognize to be able to map

581
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,190
sign language to actual spoken words so

582
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,570
this is a prototype but it's something

583
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,610
that you could do as well as JavaScript

584
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,220
developers and hopefully you feel like

585
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,139
you know that hopefully it makes a bit

586
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:24,220
more sense now that I explained to you

587
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,460
how it works and finally and I realized

588
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,809
that if you just a couple of days ago

589
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:33,129
you can store data into textile like so

590
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:35,289
the way this one works and I wish I

591
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:37,119
really wanted to get it to work for

592
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,610
today but I didn't have the time it's

593
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,799
like if you magnetized conductive thread

594
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,429
you could actually encode bits into it

595
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,200
and you can just like send messages so

596
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,929
this particular demo is actually around

597
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:52,509
gesture recognition with just magnetized

598
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:54,100
thread so it's not in the camera it's

599
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,929
reading the magnetometer in your phone

600
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:58,929
and when it senses the change in

601
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:00,759
magnetic field you could actually have

602
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,350
encode like build different types of

603
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,330
gestures just by having a little piece

604
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,549
of magnetized conductive thread on your

605
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:08,919
finger and that works through your

606
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:10,389
clothes so it means that you could

607
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:12,279
actually have your phone in your pocket

608
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:12,880
and you

609
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,770
by doing it putting your hand a bit

610
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,450
closer just trigger things and if you

611
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,730
have a piece of thread on all of your

612
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,620
fingers you could really map so and just

613
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,980
use quite quite nicely and and it's

614
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,750
really cool that you don't have you

615
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,130
don't have to have a PhD to do things

616
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,740
like this like I was I'm quite convinced

617
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,030
that I could figure out how to do this

618
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,560
it's gonna take me probably a bit more

619
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,060
time but I was googling yesterday like

620
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,680
how to calculate the magnitude of

621
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,300
magnetic fields and I was like oh my god

622
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,070
you know it's so cool I didn't figure it

623
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,930
out yet I need to find the formula but

624
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,170
you have a web you have the sensor API

625
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,580
in the browser that allows you to have

626
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,560
access to stuff from the magnetometer

627
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,750
and your phone it just doesn't it just

628
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,220
doesn't give you the magnitude so you

629
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,680
have to calculate yourself so maybe I

630
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,820
will come back one day and I would have

631
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,270
figured it out then of course you know

632
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,920
I've been talking about the

633
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,480
possibilities and how excited I am about

634
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,730
this but there are limits so I have to

635
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,980
mention that as well it is partially

636
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,510
waterproof we're talking about textile

637
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,220
so obviously you know if you wear

638
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,990
something on a jacket and it rains you

639
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,690
have to be a bit careful but you you can

640
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,070
add a certain coating so there's a spray

641
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,140
that you can add on conductive thread to

642
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,810
make it waterproof a connective thread

643
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,510
works for two years maximum so I think

644
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,910
it works like well for two years and

645
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,170
then like that it doesn't work anymore

646
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,580
all of a sudden but it means that the

647
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,360
reading might change over time and

648
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,260
finally quite interesting the

649
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,730
capacitance changes with external

650
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,890
factors and that will impact the way

651
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,970
that you're going to code that will

652
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,100
impact the threshold but what it means

653
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,720
is that depending on the weather if it's

654
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,700
humid or dry the reading that you're

655
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,380
gonna get the capacitance is going to be

656
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,720
different so your threshold you know

657
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,400
mine was a thousand but if it was like a

658
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,540
dry winter day it might have been

659
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,580
different so depending on what you

660
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,990
actually want to build if it's a jacket

661
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,250
that goes outside you'll have to take

662
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,530
that into consideration if you have like

663
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,450
a couch at home while you will be less

664
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,860
affected by external factors so it

665
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,140
should be all right but yeah so that's

666
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,120
to me that's the main limits that I

667
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,460
found also if you want to do this I

668
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,540
would not advise to do it by hand

669
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,070
because sometimes it takes hours to just

670
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,480
put stuff together and that was very

671
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,940
frustrating for me and a few extras so I

672
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,990
made most of my experiments with

673
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,490
conductive thread but it's not the only

674
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,890
material that you can use so there's

675
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,270
actually quite a lot you can use

676
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,370
conductive rubber stretches sensors so

677
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,570
you can

678
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,430
detect how the rice conducted but also

679
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,930
how much you stretchy so that's pretty

680
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,160
cool I don't know what I would do with

681
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,800
it but that's nice the second one is a

682
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,900
piece of conductive fabric so instead of

683
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,660
just having the thread you could

684
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,460
actually cover a bigger area of textile

685
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,440
by cutting fabric into different shapes

686
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,470
or or just cover or have an entire shirt

687
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,210
that's conductive instead of just a you

688
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,560
know piece of it

689
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,480
you have pressure-sensitive conductive

690
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,330
sheet where instead of just having the

691
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,650
connectivity you could have the pressure

692
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,810
how much you're pressing on the sheet as

693
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,300
well and then finally you have stretch

694
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,330
resistive fabric where you can read the

695
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,780
amount of stretch by by stretching it

696
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,790
and the what that would allow you to do

697
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,500
as well is to play with something that I

698
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,190
really want to do

699
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,170
that's called electrical to typography

700
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,780
where instead of just so it's about

701
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,030
finding coordinates as well but for me

702
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,680
to find coordinates and map them to a

703
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,050
screen I made a grid of thread and I

704
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,910
converted that into coordinates but if

705
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,390
you have a sheet of fabric there is

706
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,520
actually a way to try and find

707
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,830
ultimately where you're touching it by

708
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,660
doing electrical topography so you're

709
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,120
adding sensors all around the sheet and

710
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,230
they're going to give you a certain

711
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,570
value of capacitance and as your body

712
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,820
touches the conductive sheet it's gonna

713
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,950
it's gonna change the electric charge

714
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,410
and by reading the data coming in all

715
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,570
sensors you can approximately know how

716
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,670
close you are to certain senses rather

717
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,310
than others and what I really like about

718
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,260
that is that it's not something that I

719
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,390
thought JavaScript devs would be able to

720
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,160
do like usually just build websites but

721
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,320
now I know that by just going with a bit

722
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,780
of hardware you can actually come up you

723
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,490
this probably there's probably a formula

724
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,290
to actually calculate this I just need

725
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,870
to buy the sensors and then figure stuff

726
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,850
out and and just play with stuff like

727
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,010
this which i think is really cool and

728
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,890
then finally before I finish some final

729
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,900
words of wisdom that are not by me by

730
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,330
never entertain imagination is more

731
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,040
important than knowledge for knowledge

732
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,870
is limited to all we now know and

733
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,180
understand while imagination embraces

734
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,370
the entire world and or there ever will

735
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,890
be to know and understand and I read

736
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,810
this quote while I was reading a really

737
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,970
short essay called the usefulness of

738
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,780
useless knowledge and what I really like

739
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,340
you don't have to believe me

740
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,540
you when I say that this is really

741
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,160
interesting and important to look into

742
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,460
this

743
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,530
but if Einstein says that it's important

744
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,670
then you know you kind of have to

745
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,920
believe it but the reason why I'm saying

746
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,750
that is because I feel like sometimes as

747
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,450
developers we're not really using our

748
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,720
full potential in what we can build I

749
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,610
think we might we might forget that a

750
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,380
lot of people who are not devs have to

751
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,270
just take the world as it is and just

752
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,770
buy the stuff that other people have

753
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,000
built without really having the chance

754
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,310
to make it more personal or you can

755
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,020
imagine but you can't build where as

756
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,910
developers even just JavaScript

757
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,740
developers it doesn't you don't need to

758
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,050
to like have like a master's degree or

759
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,060
know all the languages in the world it's

760
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,190
just about being curious and wants you

761
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,960
not only imagine what you could do with

762
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,090
tech but you also get to build it and I

763
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,620
feel like that's that's extremely

764
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,970
powerful we don't know what kind of

765
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,020
interactions are going to be in the

766
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,940
future but we can actually get to tinker

767
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,400
and maybe even you know get to influence

768
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,800
how it's gonna be and that's like one of

769
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,480
my favorite part of take if tech was

770
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,610
only about building react components at

771
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,680
work I might not want to be there I mean

772
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,660
it's cool too but I the fact that you

773
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,760
can use technology to build a lot more

774
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,270
and whatever comes to mind is really

775
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,610
really cool to me so that's all I had

776
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,350
today thank you very much thanks a lot

777
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,390
the organizers for helping me set up

778
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,520
that was a bit that was a bit of a

779
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,290
hassle but thank you everybody for

780
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,300
staying with me for half an hour and if

781
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,400
you have any questions about that or if

782
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,840
you have any ideas of stuff that you

783
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,890
want to build if you just want to talk

784
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,110
about that I will be around for the next

785
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,420
two days and otherwise I will be sharing

786
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,760
the slides on Twitter there's a lot more

787
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,120
resources and the videos will work

788
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,110
better than they did here because they

789
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,390
didn't but anyway thank you thank you so

790
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,670
much that was it
