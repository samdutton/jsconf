1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,000

yeah I'm Jessica Lord I'm an engineer

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,670
I'm based in New York I'm really excited

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,339
to be here I've never been here before

4
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:16,410
and I'm really excited to have the

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,270
opportunity to give this talk I'm not

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,220
going to talk about how electron works

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,220
or how to use it I'm gonna talk about

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,849
how it even came to be I guess and so

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,010
first I want to say what electron is

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,750
some of you may already know you've

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,759
either decided you love it or you hate

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,860
it and so for those of you who have not

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,219
decided if you love it or you hate it

14
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:39,690
electron is an open source library built

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,540
at github that combines node and chrome

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,910
into a single environment so that you

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,180
can use web technology like HTML CSS to

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,039
build desktop apps that will run on Mac

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,350
or Windows or Linux okay so when we

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,969
start this story we go all the way back

21
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,229
to 2015 so long ago but actually

22
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,759
electron which at this point was called

23
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:08,430
atom shell was about two years old at

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,619
this point so electron is like six years

25
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,380
old now an atom was even older atom

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,130
github github text editor was even older

27
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,160
so it's 2015 and I was working at github

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,190
and I had just moved on to the atom team

29
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,080
and I moved on to the atom team because

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,250
I wanted to write more JavaScript and I

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,720
moved on to that team to do more

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,759
JavaScript not because I had any idea

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,520
about desktop applications or what the

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,170
woes were of someone who had tried to

35
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,030
build a desktop application before I'd

36
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,090
never ever considered what's the desktop

37
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,920
application how are people making them

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,610
how do they usually make them and the

39
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,800
reality was that native desktop

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,130
applications typically meant if you

41
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,720
wanted them to work on every operating

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,069
system you might have to have three

43
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:58,619
separate teams building three separate

44
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,860
apps to work for all of your users and

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,629
that's a lot of resources so you

46
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:05,310
actually may not be supporting all of

47
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,170
the platforms you may be only supporting

48
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,170
one or two and that had been the reality

49
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:17,980
of building desktop applications Oh No

50
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:27,580
okay not great okay there we are all

51
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,160
right so I was on the atom team and I

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,450
was there cuz I was pumped because I was

53
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,390
going to write JavaScript more and the

54
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,230
more I on boarded to the team and

55
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,150
learned about how Adam worked I learned

56
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,830
about Adams shell and that it was

57
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,230
actually pretty special that Adam was a

58
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,330
desktop app that worked on three

59
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,950
operating systems and that it was

60
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,319
because of Adams shell that I could do

61
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,110
all of this and I thought that was

62
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,180
pretty special I think Adams great I

63
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,450
still use Adam but as a text editor and

64
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,120
there's other text editors and Adam

65
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,620
shell was doing something that nothing

66
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,360
else really did and I felt like it was

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,910
doing something that was potentially

68
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,769
really empowering and so I learned more

69
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:14,950
about how the team arrived there earlier

70
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,079
on in Adams days they had sort of done

71
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,060
some shopping for libraries because

72
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,560
there had been this vision for building

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,709
the desktop app Adam it's when there was

74
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,410
chromium embedded framework but this is

75
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,700
this is my Goldilocks illustration

76
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,959
chromium embedded framework wasn't too

77
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,410
heavy it was all of Chrome in wjs didn't

78
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,319
embed node in a way that was as seamless

79
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,370
as it could be and the developers on the

80
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,290
atom team at that time we're talking to

81
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,380
people on nwj s and they met Chang zc

82
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,380
Ben's on github and they really shared

83
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,959
this vision of this other more perfect

84
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,660
bowl of porridge which could be Adams

85
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,690
shell and so github contracted Chang and

86
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,019
he started building Adams show and get

87
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,180
in Chang eventually joined github

88
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,910
full-time and that was kind of the state

89
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,450
of things

90
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,760
Adams shell was a dependency of Adam

91
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,730
maintained by one person meaning it had

92
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,359
a bus factor of one so if anything

93
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,280
happened to Chang it would be really bad

94
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,150
and and it was just kind of hidden there

95
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,700
as a dependency of Adam there was no

96
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,970
plan for it and just one person taking

97
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,180
care of it and so there were already

98
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,880
people

99
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,490
in this space wanting to build desktop

100
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,220
apps with web technology and so slack

101
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,820
and Microsoft were looking at this and

102
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,410
so if you already were in the headspace

103
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,820
you were already searching for a

104
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,650
solution you and maybe already tried n

105
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,010
wjs to you at least knew enough to

106
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,200
question like oh how is Adam doing this

107
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,060
and then you could go into that Adam org

108
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,740
on github and ruffle through all of the

109
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,310
repositories and then you would find

110
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,470
Adam shell and you'd be like oh this is

111
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,450
how Adam is doing it but that was kind

112
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,090
of the only way to know what was

113
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,290
happening until Microsoft did that and

114
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,090
Microsoft built an editor called vs code

115
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,490
which is like an editor just like Adam

116
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,500
but so they were going to launch vs code

117
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,620
and we knew about that on the adam team

118
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,870
and we thought it would be pretty silly

119
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,120
for them to launch a new text editor and

120
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,700
say that it was built on adam's shell

121
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,910
there was no reason for it to reference

122
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,370
another text editor and because you

123
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,800
could build anything with adam shell it

124
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,620
just then at that point seemed really

125
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,950
silly for whatever people built with it

126
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:48,140
to be tied in name to Adam so vs code

127
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,170
was the impetus to name adam shell

128
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:59,690
electron which is a part of it wasn't a

129
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,740
lot of thinking behind it but but i

130
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,050
honestly was pumped I'm like see people

131
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,600
are using this like let's do some stuff

132
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,240
like electrons awesome and I thought

133
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,980
this was going to be the kicking off

134
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,870
point and so in our team meetings and

135
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,040
our mini summits

136
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,600
I was the person when they were like

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,070
okay what's on our roadmap and I was

138
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,440
like electron stuff electron stuff let's

139
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,060
do something electron like let's put

140
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,190
resources into electron we really need

141
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,990
to not ignore this and I was probably

142
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,700
annoying but I was told electrons not

143
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,310
important which is wrong that no one

144
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,380
will work on electron

145
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,960
so wrong and if I want to work on

146
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,320
electron I should use my weekends rude

147
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,610
[Applause]

148
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:06,020
very busy so the thing is I persisted hi

149
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,560
I researched the space the usage the

150
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,810
people that were working on electron and

151
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,210
using electron what was missing what we

152
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,120
really needed and so I started building

153
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,340
roadmaps and I just kept pushing and

154
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,010
eventually I got my 40 hours to spend on

155
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,190
electron

156
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,690
still on the atom team as a person on

157
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,600
the atom team but who could just work on

158
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,950
electron and so inside of the github org

159
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,430
what was to my benefit was that really

160
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,170
you only care about github com

161
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,120
everything else is kind of outside the

162
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
scope a little bit like there's the

163
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,450
world of desktop apps there's the github

164
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,410
desktop app and there's atom and then

165
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,690
down trailing atom would be electron so

166
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,580
I got to be in this kind of special

167
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,500
position that I was a little bit out of

168
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,280
the way out of sight not too many people

169
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,750
bothered me so that's why I got to say

170
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,450
first things first documentation which

171
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:18,590
never happens and let's see if I can get

172
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,690
this to work without no I can't I'll

173
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,510
just keep going this way so I started

174
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,060
with documentation and I also started

175
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,190
with a static site because static sites

176
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,950
are great and maybe you only need a

177
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,599
static site and use your google jam

178
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,849
stack and learn more about how you

179
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,250
probably just need a static site I use

180
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,590
Jekyll because it was github and github

181
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,550
pages supports Jekyll out of the box and

182
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,790
so luckily Chang had written a bunch of

183
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,590
documentation already and I went through

184
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,730
all of that edited it made it consistent

185
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,730
language and then I made a standard for

186
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,250
the markdown semantics for it

187
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,620
and it was really important to me to

188
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,540
have a single source of truth the

189
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,579
electron Doc's lived in the electron

190
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,610
repo and everyone gets a copy if you

191
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,040
fork or clone or download electron you

192
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,310
get a copy of the docs it's really great

193
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,550
when the docs live in the source try and

194
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,699
do that and their markdown they're not

195
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:23,069
in some other language that requires an

196
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:26,850
ePub book thing software they're in

197
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,370
markdown they render on github people

198
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,660
have heard of markdown and so I made a

199
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,899
style guide that literally tells you

200
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,589
like how many how many h1 headers there

201
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:43,920
should be one on a page of documentation

202
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,610
and it goes on to say exactly how we

203
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,500
would describe what a method would be

204
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,980
and what an event would be and how to

205
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,230
represent these things and markdown and

206
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,089
it was important to have this be

207
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,750
consistent not only for the end users

208
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,410
but so that we could target it with CSS

209
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,689
later so we have a Jekyll site and we

210
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:12,120
have a folder of markdown Doc's on in

211
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,360
the repo so I never managed to learn

212
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,059
Ruby at github so I wrote a bunch of

213
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,610
note scripts inside of my Jekyll file to

214
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,079
stream out that Doc's folder oh yeah

215
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,540
sorry backing up every electron release

216
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,439
is a tarball

217
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:30,480
and because the code or the

218
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,029
documentation is inside the repo every

219
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:34,980
electron release contains that versions

220
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,059
Docs

221
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,329
so I wrote the note scripts to stream

222
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:41,550
out that doc folder and then basically

223
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,879
pops out the version number and things

224
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,120
like bread crumb information file name

225
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,559
information and all of this stuff so

226
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,629
that I could then generate the front

227
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:53,490
matter that Jekyll wants on the top of

228
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,509
its pages so that we would end up with a

229
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,990
site that would have really nice-looking

230
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,430
Doc's with information like the

231
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,730
breadcrumbs and the version and then

232
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,329
another part of making the standard for

233
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,939
how we were going to do documentation

234
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,020
was also saying

235
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,060
that all of the API Doc's are gonna have

236
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,220
a single line at the top that just tell

237
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,370
you in one sentence what this is so that

238
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,080
you don't land on a page with a sea of

239
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,330
text and you can just figure out our am

240
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,190
I even in the right place to begin with

241
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,160
and then part of working with electron

242
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,590
is that there are two processes main and

243
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,930
renderer and that's important and it's

244
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,780
different than other libraries and so

245
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,850
it's also at the top of the

246
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,770
documentation here so that you can know

247
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,490
that you're in the right place alright

248
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,450
so again making being really concerned

249
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,070
about how we were using markdown to

250
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,990
document the code was also knowing that

251
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,730
it was going to end up on this website

252
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,200
so that we could do things like target

253
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,300
elements like that some API is an

254
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,190
electron work only on Mac or they work

255
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,040
only on Windows and so knowing that it

256
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,630
was going to be on the site we can use

257
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,400
the CSS to make it a little bit better

258
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,930
and make these things look like tags but

259
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,700
it's also important when you're thinking

260
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,100
about that to not forsake the original

261
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,130
markdown don't do something so wild that

262
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,230
it then becomes unreadable and markdown

263
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,420
I wanted it to still be readable and

264
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,430
markdown but also something I could

265
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,700
target and improve with styles on the

266
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,240
website so that was the first thing and

267
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,450
then the next thing was how to get

268
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,060
people started on their very first

269
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,440
electron app I wanted people to get

270
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,140
started quickly I wanted people to be

271
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,570
able to understand and also I didn't

272
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,010
want to have a lot of extra work because

273
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,620
I was maintaining him doing all this

274
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,410
stuff on my own and then I had my next

275
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,540
kind of battle because I was still in

276
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,760
the atom team and still getting input

277
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,210
from people and Adam used to be in Ruby

278
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,610
actually before it was open sourced and

279
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,110
written in node and so a lot of people

280
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,030
on the team had come from that world and

281
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,740
they were like there needs to be an

282
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,720
electron in it like a rails in it and I

283
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,780
typed rails in it before and you get a

284
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,330
lot of folders and I didn't want that

285
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,920
experience for people coming into

286
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,620
electron I didn't want you

287
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,890
to run a command that generated a bunch

288
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,360
of folders that you didn't understand

289
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,790
and you maybe didn't need half of them

290
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,790
and the thing is there's nothing wrong

291
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,460
with an it scripts and scaffolding but

292
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,400
it was wrong for electron-electron apps

293
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,470
you could build a single app that it

294
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,930
runs in your menu bar and tells you the

295
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,750
weather and is this big and you can also

296
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,060
build slack so we could either build a

297
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,940
scaffolding system that prescribed one

298
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,890
way to write electron apps which there

299
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,590
isn't or we could build a scaffolding

300
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,350
system that supported every single

301
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,300
flavor and recipe of electron app

302
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,630
possible which is a lot of work so I

303
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,660
felt like we would just no we weren't

304
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,680
gonna do that

305
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,410
these are flags in an imaginary command

306
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:22,040
line scripts that just say no um luckily

307
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,190
I got my way and I got to do this

308
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,380
version instead which is the electron

309
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,740
Quick Start which is a bare-bones

310
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,890
electron app that you clone and then you

311
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,880
npm install and npm run and it launches

312
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,700
a very bare-bones electron app and so

313
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,350
for me i wanted it to be really simple i

314
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,450
want it to be a jumping-off point and

315
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,440
not do too much but also let people know

316
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,140
where they were so in this the dev tools

317
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,680
opens up so as a web developer you're

318
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,570
you can already orient to yourself it

319
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,190
looks like Chrome it looks like things

320
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,170
you're familiar with and then there's

321
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,040
only a couple of electron API calls just

322
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,930
to demonstrate what that is but other

323
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,840
than that it is super simple and when

324
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,520
you open it in your text editor you see

325
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,100
an index.html file and you know what to

326
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,430
do with that and you can start you can

327
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,260
start editing it and see the changes

328
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,640
right away so developers developers

329
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,970
developers

330
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,730
I prioritize the developers who did not

331
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,160
realize what electron was and what they

332
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,830
could build with electron I did not care

333
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,780
so much about the ones that were already

334
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,760
building vias code and slack because

335
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,500
they got it they were already in that

336
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,810
headspace they were already looking for

337
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,990
something like electron and I wanted the

338
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,490
people who didn't yet know that they

339
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,500
could do things with electron to know

340
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,040
and so the next thing I worked on was an

341
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,940
electron app that demos the electron API

342
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,790
so especially in the early days it was

343
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,810
still kind of confusing at what electron

344
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,760
was to begin with it was Chrome and it

345
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,100
was node and desktop apps and what do

346
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,650
people mean with native operating system

347
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,270
and it was I felt like one of the big

348
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,070
hurdles was still explaining to people

349
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,470
why you would use electron what you

350
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,680
would do with it and so the API demo app

351
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,910
is an electron app that opens up you

352
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,800
download it you already get the sense of

353
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,570
like Oh an electron app is something my

354
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,430
users would install like a normal app

355
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,160
with icons and it's a very familiar flow

356
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,140
and then you open it up and you have a

357
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,450
left sidebar of common electron things

358
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,300
like opening a new window printing a PDF

359
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,270
and some of these common native things

360
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,790
that you would use an electron and you

361
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,010
get to demo them and actually interact

362
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,930
with it and see like oh this is what

363
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,060
they mean when they say system dialog

364
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,060
and start to get ideas and see what you

365
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,640
can do with electron and a cool thing

366
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,920
about this app is that it's an electron

367
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,280
app and the sample code is the actual

368
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,990
code so we can use the node API to fs

369
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,650
read a file and then use the web api to

370
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,839
say the text content of this element is

371
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,150
what we just read from this file and so

372
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,760
in terms of maintaining the app when you

373
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,950
update the app the sample code is also

374
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,230
updated it's not two things you have to

375
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,610
take care of so reoccurring theme is not

376
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,180
giving yourself more work another thing

377
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,750
is that this was a few years

378
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,200
and es6 was still really new and I'm

379
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,810
targeting developed like web developers

380
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,580
who aren't using es6 everywhere and I

381
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,260
didn't want to write just because I

382
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,730
could I didn't want to write a bunch of

383
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,380
JavaScript that looks different to

384
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,530
people and but at the same time wanted

385
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,450
to highlight that a feature of electron

386
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,420
is that you get es6 out of the box and

387
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,140
so the API demos app explains that there

388
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,300
are three bits of es6 that we're using

389
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,700
and here's what they are it was constant

390
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,160
let each string templates that way

391
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,190
people are made aware educating them and

392
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,290
also just not writing a bunch of

393
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,450
different looking code because we can or

394
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,780
it's the new cool thing cuz it's not

395
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,610
about you also this app was built to

396
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,560
open up I wanted people to be able to

397
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,530
split it open look at the insides and

398
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,820
see how an electron app works and so all

399
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,870
of the files and folders are thought

400
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,670
about so that they all relate so that

401
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,280
you can open it up and you can find the

402
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,540
HTML view and the corresponding main and

403
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,790
process main and renderer process files

404
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,390
that go along with it and then there's

405
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,040
documentation about that folder

406
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,410
structure and diagramming of how this

407
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,690
app actually runs from start to

408
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,770
beginning which is something I would

409
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,830
love to see more often I want to know

410
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,930
like what happens when you run this what

411
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:22,190
happens first okay so I said that I was

412
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,190
prioritizing new developers that didn't

413
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,200
already know what electron was but

414
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,000
doesn't mean I didn't care at all about

415
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,960
the people who are already contributing

416
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,110
electron really needed those people and

417
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,540
needed the electron community and create

418
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,310
a space for this userland

419
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:47,340
ecosystem to evolve because electron had

420
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,230
been built for atom it had the features

421
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,880
that atom needed it didn't have the

422
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,120
features that a slack or a chat app

423
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,960
needed and so it took it took those team

424
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,779
to contribute those features back to

425
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:03,700
electron and that was really essential

426
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,029
for making electron better and making it

427
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:09,820
have tons of features and api's that

428
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,279
atom would never come to on its own

429
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,899
because they were never things that Adam

430
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:17,620
was going to do and so there is a place

431
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,110
on the site where it's huge now you can

432
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,360
contribute your electron app and the

433
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,330
goal was to help people find each other

434
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,159
so people writing electron apps could

435
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,809
find other people writing electron apps

436
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:34,480
and hopefully some of them were open

437
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,039
source and people could learn from each

438
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:39,580
other and then there's userland which

439
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,940
has all the stuff that the users have

440
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,890
built which makes sense for people to do

441
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,730
like building a react specific Wow five

442
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,770
minutes okay

443
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,720
a react specific tool for starting

444
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,020
electron apps with react so then

445
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,929
eventually one more atom person came

446
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,029
over to electron we got head count to

447
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,549
hire one more person there were four of

448
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:11,679
us we got to God electron to its 1.0 we

449
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,110
moved it all out of the atom org

450
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,120
it got its own org we had our own

451
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:23,590
meetings and it was really real and then

452
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,370
like Mary Poppins I went on my way for

453
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,600
greener pastures I wanted to work with

454
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,360
more women if I'm real so the electron

455
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,830
team is great now it's a lot different

456
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,120
but anyways that was my own thing so

457
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,090
final thoughts and why I thought any of

458
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,490
this was maybe worth talking about is

459
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,380
that community engineering is something

460
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,020
I when I look back at what I was working

461
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,370
on then and kind of what it would be

462
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,350
called now or what I was doing at all I

463
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,320
think of it as community engineering and

464
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,700
actually now I've seen ipfs do a job

465
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,430
posting for community engineer

466
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,620
ghin shiver at glitch is a community

467
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,150
engineer and and community engineering

468
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,290
is a thing and I think it's great and my

469
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,820
background in the urban design and

470
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,430
architecture I think is not so different

471
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,410
to why I found all of this work really

472
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,290
satisfying because it's about helping or

473
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,070
it's about how people understand and

474
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,710
experience a system and building tools

475
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,060
that put new developers first electrons

476
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,890
situation was also really different and

477
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,720
I think that worked to its advantage it

478
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,840
wasn't like Adam it wasn't Adam was

479
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,780
github vision and an internal vision

480
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,060
that had been shaped and cared about for

481
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,600
a really really long time and so

482
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,650
electron didn't have that electron

483
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,260
wasn't planned it was off kind of to the

484
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,360
side and all of that worked out really

485
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,210
great for electron and electron got to

486
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,680
be in this really unique position where

487
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,570
it was an open source project that

488
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,210
really responded to the community the

489
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,340
community is who had cared about because

490
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,860
there wasn't there wasn't this internal

491
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,320
github vision like there was for Adam

492
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,290
one day though electron will be gone and

493
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,810
it should be because it should be the

494
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,840
stepping stone to the next thing and if

495
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,640
you hate electron and CPU usage you

496
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,560
should hate more if nothing ever

497
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,040
replaces it because that's the problem

498
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,480
but it should be replaced and something

499
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,520
better should come along and I also hope

500
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,690
that our current ideas about

501
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,510
documentation and talking about code

502
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,020
will be gone too another thing I did

503
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,800
outside of like my official electron

504
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,470
capacity was challenging myself to try

505
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,660
to explain electron in the simplest

506
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,020
terms as I could and so I created the

507
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,230
site essential electron with the

508
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,930
limitations of each section has to be

509
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,180
two to three sentences it can't use

510
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,700
jargon if there's industry terms I can't

511
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,060
avoid they're defined below and there's

512
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,640
links on the bottom of each section for

513
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,570
more information and I just want to

514
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,730
- I love that people are doing more

515
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,429
illustrations and diagrams and I just

516
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:30,960
hope that keeps growing and we change

517
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,630
the way we talk about code and and who

518
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,789
we assume is reading our documentation

519
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:43,110
and so in general I hope that you see

520
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,230
ways to scale down and actually give

521
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,000
yourself less work so that you can focus

522
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,030
on people and yeah I guess that's it
