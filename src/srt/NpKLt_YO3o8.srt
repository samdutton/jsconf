Boris Martin yeah you might have seen us

32
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,370
this morning or one-and-a-half years ago

33
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,970
at this very place and we want to tell

34
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,820
you how this entire thing was made and

35
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,220
there's a story to it and I won't tell

36
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,020
the story so the year was 2014 and I

37
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,030
gave a talk at chess cons about Web

38
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,640
Audio for music production and live

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,430
performances and there was this part in

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,340
this talk where was actually performing

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,710
music and this is all look like

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:57,230
[Music]

43
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:05,080


44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,090
[Music]

45
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,640
I don't remember that load okay so what

46
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
he saw was just me dabbling on an iPad

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,170
and I had no idea how to make music I

48
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,690
bootlegs jay-z Linkin Park they didn't

49
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,110
sue me what's great and but at that time

50
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,560
I had a much bigger dream and I was the

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,550
free guy

52
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,010
their drums and they taught me to use

53
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,640
software so the problem is neither do I

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,230
have three people capable of doing that

55
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,080
including me nor do I have the MIDI

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,350
instruments nor do I have the software

57
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,510
so that was kind of a foreshadowing of

58
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,350
what happened and so after that I had a

59
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,640
plan the plan was find band members by

60
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,570
MIDI instrument and write the software

61
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,530
so just as I was just browsing Twitter a

62
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,150
couple of weeks later and then I saw

63
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,300
this one tweet by Khalil he's like Oh

64
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,920
before I was the developer I was

65
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,220
requisitioned check it out this is me so

66
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,860
let's check it out

67
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:35,810
[Music]

68
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,780
whoa yeah now it's like I have to have

69
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,390
to collaborate with this guy he knows

70
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,070
how to make music and he has a voice

71
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,620
that sounds good so meet the ill

72
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,470
inspector okay so this is just a little

73
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,500
story time so I was doing music before I

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,450
was working at the developer so I was

75
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,850
like like four years or so it's just

76
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,830
like touring in Europe and doing like

77
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,440
dancehall but living in Leipzig there

78
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,660
was a label there and actually so this

79
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,520
video was actually shot in Japan because

80
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,770
there was at some point there was this

81
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,260
Japanese guy he wrote as an email saying

82
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,020
hey we would like to release an album or

83
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,420
something into it okay great so we

84
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,730
recorded an album for him and this track

85
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,680
actually made for him as a request

86
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,330
because he said in Japan they loved

87
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,450
poopa son who was like hmm he's like a

88
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,150
foundation dancehall reggae artist and

89
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,090
so I made a song about him and we shot

90
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,370
this video over they were in Japan for a

91
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,990
week to do like promotions and stuff

92
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,900
like that and that's how it kind of was

93
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,060
traded and actually was my greatest hit

94
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,810
I would say what so the cool thing was

95
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,850
when I was talking to Khalil he actually

96
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,180
told me well I have this brother Shiva

97
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,580
in the background he's actually a music

98
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,060
producer I was like that is great so let

99
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,090
me count I need three people me Khalil

100
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,890
and the guy who actually knows how to

101
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,040
make music it's like yeah got the bad

102
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,440
memories then I just had to buy media

103
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,120
instruments and we just bought I just

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,160
bought like one of these very sturdy

105
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
very great has a lot of buttons that

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,310
means you can do a lot of things I

107
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,800
thought I had no idea like really so

108
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,660
they call got the MIDI instrument just

109
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,360
have to write the software writing

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,010
software is easy right I mean we all

111
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,210
know that it takes a week but should we

112
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,190
really look like a huge music production

113
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,290
app for this just to perform a task on

114
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,380
knowing that it's like a couple of weeks

115
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,980
before Jays Khan's probably not also

116
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,720
what kind of music do we actually want

117
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,460
to make so we reach out to

118
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,770
the date comes organizers like hey what

119
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,570
kind of performance were you thinking of

120
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,750
and Martha was like be creative we trust

121
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,610
you

122
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,070
our excellent hands great so yeah we

123
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,840
because I'm from Berlin they're from

124
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,090
Stuttgart so we met up at Kelly's house

125
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:15,539
and it's this is you okay yeah so that's

126
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,180
where like we had our first meeting and

127
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,940
we're basic city we're trying to figure

128
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,760
out what we're going to do so we told

129
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,250
Boris words we need music boards like

130
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,000
okay I got music and was like cool so

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,710
like because Boris has been doing music

132
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,949
since forever and so he had like a bunch

133
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:37,680
of beats lying around and we didn't have

134
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,930
a lot of time so we had to there was not

135
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,060
really time to do a whole new beat and

136
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,280
so I guess so we chose one of his that

137
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,729
was unreleased and we liked it so we we

138
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,169
decided on the music first and then we

139
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,849
were like okay what are we going to do

140
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,080
like we have to do something in the

141
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,039
browser like just music not enough so so

142
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,320
we so the thought basically came up I

143
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,000
don't know who had it or whatever but

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,470
like we're thinking okay we're going to

145
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,570
take talks I mean I think what you know

146
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,729
like take some interesting snippets and

147
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,849
then trigger them on the music in the

148
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:10,740
browser like the video has to play in

149
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,330
the browser the music has to be played

150
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,250
in the browser and everything needs to

151
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,560
be triggered by as the the pads

152
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,470
basically right so so basically sorry so

153
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,880
this was basically how it worked we had

154
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,550
sorry we had the music running and we

155
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,459
were triggering just like random

156
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,690
snippets that we just cut out of the

157
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,580
YouTube videos and we're just trying

158
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,149
around stuff like this

159
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:47,230
the music in the background triggering

160
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,410
sniffing and so this was going on that

161
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,060
weekend and we were just triangle for

162
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,339
two days we're trying out stuff back and

163
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:56,899
forth and and that weekend we kind of

164
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,880
laid the groundwork for all of it and

165
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,600
then I would track see just me

166
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,089
performing over the beat so had some

167
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:11,769
lyrics

168
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:20,959
ready yeah okay what and this is

169
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,889
basically I'm just going to go to this

170
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:30,529
one okay so and then this video the last

171
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,290
one was us just before the conference we

172
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,389
had everything kind of ready the video

173
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:38,930
the videos were cut to a certain so that

174
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,940
you can see the speaker's really big and

175
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,069
then we had Boris also put a filter over

176
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:46,220
the video and so that was the first

177
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,470
iteration and and then and actually this

178
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,480
took like weeks and weeks of meeting up

179
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,139
with each other

180
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:53,000
arranging the snippet so that it kind of

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,319
makes sense that it's funny

182
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:57,050
and so like Dorothy and me were meeting

183
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,720
once a week or so for a while and Boris

184
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,389
was kind of yeah we were just trying to

185
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,370
make sense out of the snippets we had

186
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,060
and huh and we were trying to make sense

187
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,050
we're trying to make it look good and

188
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,930
actually Jana was programming the

189
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,430
software the whole time like there was

190
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,690
lots of little things that need to be

191
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,420
figure out like how can we because

192
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,240
because the videos needed to be instant

193
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,649
like when you press the button it just

194
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,750
needs to book happen right away it needs

195
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,130
to be synced on the music and everything

196
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,190
so there was a lot of crazy stuff that

197
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,720
when I'm sure you're going to talk about

198
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,980
this in a minute and so this is actually

199
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,399
practicing the day before the conference

200
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,660
2015 in our hotel room you can see the

201
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,180
venue right there just going through the

202
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,970
whole thing

203
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,820
okay that was us doing sound check the

204
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,779
day before and yeah and now young with

205
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,970
the software so yeah the software is

206
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,320
really easy right

207
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,589
so it just has to read MIDI data that

208
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:02,389
this thing sends a thing to your browser

209
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:05,149
and you like are cool these are events

210
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:08,209
but this is what the data looks like

211
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,500
that this thing is trying to communicate

212
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,600
with you felt like the movie the arrival

213
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,670
like you have to kind understand what

214
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,320
does computer is talking to you it's

215
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,519
like all of these numbers you have to

216
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,199
make sense like what is the position

217
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:20,570
what is like did it get pressed or not

218
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,940
and is to figure out all of these you

219
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,160
have to read the midi document for this

220
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,690
thing and I was like oh I didn't know

221
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,529
that why why did I god well that just

222
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:35,149
takes like two weeks and then what you

223
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,769
have like you come up with like an idea

224
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,709
okay so for the first row I want to have

225
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,440
this video played this and then that

226
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,910
video played you come up with like an

227
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,600
idea it's kind of happy but the thing is

228
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,970
so you have a video and videos usually

229
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,160
have like a video feed and an audio feed

230
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,930
and you kind of want to have like the

231
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,940
audio desync with everything so you have

232
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,399
to kind of like split them up again to

233
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,019
make put like your text on it and

234
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:00,440
everything

235
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,899
and then you have to kind of make like

236
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,310
the video still be snappy because how do

237
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,370
you play a video without a delay in the

238
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,760
browser like using the video tag to you

239
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,360
a just to video element dot play do you

240
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,350
see preload and then play or do you see

241
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,589
use an obscure heck and then call play

242
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:32,240
on the thing a what be yet see so it

243
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,510
kind of hacky so you have to load the

244
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,959
video in an era buffer make a blog out

245
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,579
of it with the correct mind type

246
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:42,110
otherwise it doesn't know it's a video

247
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,560
and then it's the greatest thing ever

248
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,130
create an object URL out of this massive

249
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,100
video which is really bad for RAM usage

250
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,329
but we didn't care

251
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:55,640
this is the only thing that makes like

252
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,390
pushing a button and then being it

253
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,400
isn't there possible all the other ones

254
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,230
have like a lot of delay which I'm

255
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,000
probably sure we would have never heard

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,980
but the person actually pushing the

257
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,060
button really tells it so we needed this

258
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,230
and yes so the cool thing is you do the

259
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,940
same for all the elements you have

260
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,550
someone who's good at pushing buttons

261
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,400
that guy and yeah yeah JJ's called

262
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,030
opening performance software this war

263
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,610
it's always more as we know the videos

264
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,740
were pre-rendered so we just had videos

265
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,230
with the effects on it out of like

266
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,480
render it the beat was in life performed

267
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,860
actually we just pushed the button and

268
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,390
then the music was playing nobody

269
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:40,780
noticed that was great but if we only

270
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,880
had more time we would have done it all

271
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,660
life so that was 2015 so we had a nice

272
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,270
tune right so we had a pretty

273
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,400
overwhelming performance like it's kind

274
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,590
of like our little secret with multi for

275
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,030
like a couple of weeks you couldn't talk

276
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,180
about this like all giddy giddy nobody

277
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,430
know we can know about this so the the

278
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,740
response was great like we got so so

279
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,180
much great feedback and I can tell you

280
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,680
like before the talk or before the

281
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,250
performance

282
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,590
listen Foster syndrome thing that also

283
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,410
applies for music performances

284
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,430
especially if you don't know anything

285
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,920
about music it's a very bad so yeah we

286
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,670
donated in T story yeah so made the

287
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,220
nested loop t-shirts so do you have the

288
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,450
thing loaded up yeah and many people

289
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,310
wanted the t-shirt we produce the Trisha

290
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,020
for the yeah that's right and so we made

291
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,400
the story fine thing I wanted to have

292
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,260
selfies from everybody so anybody who

293
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,910
has a teacher please you didn't send a

294
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,620
selfie our way I want to have the selfie

295
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,970
so I can put it into the story flower

296
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,460
okay so there's a lots of lots of people

297
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,830
who it's Allah

298
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:59,529
and this yeah lots of cool people with

299
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:02,950
the t-shirt and yeah so we so we saw

300
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,089
those peace t-shirts on t spring and we

301
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,709
we made a little bit of money so the

302
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,990
margin on the t-shirt was very low the

303
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,390
little money thing was like 300 dollars

304
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,040
or something like that we all gave away

305
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,370
for good causes and so they're like a

306
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,709
hundred dollars for caught her cause or

307
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:21,760
something like that so we didn't make

308
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,180
any money from it but so yeah so we all

309
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,000
felt really good and it's nice to see a

310
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,860
lot of people with the t-shirt out here

311
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:42,790
today it was really cool yeah they're

312
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,920
all know that was a break a J's cones

313
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,740
break and then we got up again to step

314
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,589
it up a notch they didn't react to that

315
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:54,850
but we felt we had to do that and this

316
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,620
time I really wanted to build a real

317
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,950
piece of software not this like six

318
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,440
weeks heck that lived on this obscure

319
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,420
video hack that is still in the

320
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,870
production software now so this time we

321
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,360
actually started a six months ago

322
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,550
already like as you can see in October

323
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,160
the first two commits and then we worked

324
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,640
along the way on that and so 2015 what

325
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,709
the thing did was push a button it it

326
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:24,610
did a thing and in 2017 you push a

327
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,589
button and it does 10x things so we kind

328
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,470
of thought who who does know like which

329
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,720
one is which there by the way this is

330
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,360
this is our Tech's take an order to

331
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,810
guess which one is redox react and

332
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,600
electron so we thought like the one and

333
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,930
a half year that has like everybody was

334
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,779
talking about react Redux an extra ones

335
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,540
we don't we have to make a software to

336
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,430
make music with all of these tools so

337
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,589
that we can dog feed or industry

338
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:59,769
gullible so the app actually looks

339
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,890
amazing

340
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,660
you will see later on so you have like

341
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,060
this is like a representation of the

342
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,520
physical pad and then on the side you

343
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,890
can see like what kind of clip you want

344
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,780
to play and all these things whatever

345
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,650
you want to attach to it and so what was

346
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,690
really cool about this is you can import

347
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,910
export project set up so the thing

348
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,010
before was whenever Boris wanted to have

349
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,540
like a button on a different thing there

350
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,120
he is he was calling me and I was like

351
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,440
okay I'm going to do this

352
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,540
push that to github so that he can work

353
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,350
on it an hour later this was horrible so

354
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,510
now we can like exported zip and import

355
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,270
and all these things it has perfect

356
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,360
timing in there before that we had like

357
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,920
a lot of human errors mainly mine and

358
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,780
now there's a computer taking care of

359
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,660
the timing as in if you push the button

360
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,800
too early before the beat it can make

361
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,600
this wait a bit and I click like it will

362
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,660
be perfect to the beat so the problem is

363
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,730
if you're too late we cannot take that

364
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,200
because JavaScript doesn't have time

365
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,480
travel yet let's see see see 39 was

366
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,530
what's up this time we actually do have

367
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,440
live music I mean you didn't notice

368
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,810
before there was no like music but and

369
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,240
also the we had a life video shoulders

370
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,530
as you saw this morning but yeah this is

371
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,540
like technical stuff let's let's hear

372
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:35,190
how like a beat it's made so high so we

373
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,020
this time we wanted to make an original

374
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,430
beat or I want to do that and first up

375
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,310
the guys listen to all the talks and

376
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,790
they gathered snippets for me and then

377
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,350
I'd about 150 snippets about stuff that

378
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,340
I don't really understand and so the

379
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,840
first thing we have to do we when we

380
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,490
start from scratch we have to find

381
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,340
something that we can build on so

382
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,790
basically I was just trying out stuff

383
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,980
like so it means that some of the code

384
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,140
that's running now in angular 2 it and

385
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,670
so it means that some of the code that's

386
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,040
running now in angular 2

387
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,920
more food and so it means that the flow

388
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,610
of doodle and played around with that I

389
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,740
had to pitch function with this

390
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,290
controller which is the Ableton push and

391
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,880
I just played around and then at some

392
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,500
point we had a chorus which is as you I

393
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,780
think all know by now

394
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,960
people got JavaScript this one the

395
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,110
people got mad JavaScript and then I

396
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,420
started to build a beat around it

397
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,670
basically to have yeah pretty pretty

398
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,830
simple

399
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,930
yeah built built bent around it with the

400
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,920
bassline drums first things pretty loud

401
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:07,250
everything yes kick 8-bit kick as well

402
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:13,580
and then just build on top of it make a

403
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:33,290
bass line and some melody and then we

404
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:40,700
just need some people talking JavaScript

405
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:47,650
people got that people got bad you got

406
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,220
JavaScript people got bad yeah that's

407
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:59,800
basically what I did thank you

408
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:04,430
ah yeah so 2017 brought a lot of changes

409
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:10,010
and an event member yeah you might have

410
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,930
noticed I mean we kind of said it as

411
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,690
well Martin joined the band and was

412
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,350
doing live lights and the tech behind

413
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,990
that is pretty amazing and please tell

414
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,000
us how he did it

415
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,790
yeah technically and more roadie than

416
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:30,650
proper band member but so can we can we

417
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,340
switch to develop to see you know all

418
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,740
right of course

419
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,380
[Music]

420
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,810
all right so um who was here last year's

421
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,920
last time Jess cogs oh that's quite just

422
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,180
few people but I gave a talk at just of

423
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:04,010
you 2015 and there I kind of like left

424
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,670
through how to control professional

425
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,360
light equipment using javascript won't

426
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,540
go until that much detail here but yeah

427
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,660
that's basically what I did is a light

428
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,150
show Jas but if you will there you

429
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,030
already know that it was actually light

430
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,800
shall see is there because everything

431
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,900
you saw this morning considering the

432
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,880
light show was entirely written in CSS

433
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,200
with proper CSS killed was interpreted

434
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,410
by my browser in real-time and

435
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,440
everything I did was just toggling um

436
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,580
classes on parent element using the same

437
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:52,430
here so each of these buttons has a

438
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,260
class name attached to it and if I

439
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,720
prefer the class gets added if I release

440
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,120
it the class gets removed and there are

441
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,760
some buttons that act as switches where

442
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,910
I can just press class gets edit press

443
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,570
again class gets removed so um this was

444
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,790
basically how the lecture was controlled

445
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,260
so in order to do that we'll see us as

446
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,290
we need some HTML to operate on and lose

447
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,510
basically how that looks I have devices

448
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,970
and I give them class names I have some

449
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,280
special attributes like type and channel

450
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,360
which is the technical stuff and it

451
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,850
turns out browsers just don't care as I

452
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,650
don't know the tag name they simply

453
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,440
treat them just like HTML so all fine

454
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,450
here I know I can use proper custom

455
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,040
element if you sure but - neato so um

456
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,280
the CSS I have a color property I have a

457
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,770
brightest property and I define an

458
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,170
animation over brightness on color the

459
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,970
color is pretty simple there's something

460
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,730
that CSS a way to provide the brightness

461
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,620
is yeah something that I just made up

462
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,810
and considering more complex devices

463
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,350
like those here they can move around and

464
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,780
stuff like that there's lots and lots of

465
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,090
functions and they simply made up CSS

466
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,920
property names for each of their

467
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,370
features and all of them can be animated

468
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,690
so I add some JavaScript errors in this

469
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,480
case I would just pull the get computed

470
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,410
style of all the devices notes and I get

471
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,970
the computed style returns

472
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,100
conveniently of the current animation

473
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,950
state - including any animation and

474
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,020
finish those can really running so I'm

475
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,560
back there I had good Calavera I get the

476
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,590
brightness value and I sent them over

477
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,520
the DMX protocol side note and DMX is

478
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,740
the serial protocol that is used by each

479
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,960
and any piece of professional lighting

480
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,770
hardware there is so I can be pretty

481
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,020
sure if I come to any venue they will

482
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,020
have a DMX system and my DMX interface

483
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:07,890
will completely work with that in theory

484
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,420
so I'm the only thing I will mention

485
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,850
about DMX now is that each and every

486
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,840
device has a unique and yeah very

487
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,390
specific pre-configured address which is

488
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,780
what you saw on the HTML earlier so the

489
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,000
back to the spheres have code there's

490
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,600
obviously two problems with us first of

491
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,510
all we can't just make up CSS property

492
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,370
names because they will simply get

493
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,320
ignored by the browser get computed

494
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,930
style won't return them so that's a

495
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,490
no-go

496
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,830
only now we have custom properties so if

497
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,200
I add two dashes everything works fine

498
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,490
right yeah except that custom properties

499
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,190
together the transitions and animations

500
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,260
currently do not work as intended in any

501
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,800
browser so I have to find some way

502
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,360
around this and this is this nice little

503
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,440
hack instead of just using my properties

504
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,860
like brightness can - whatever else I

505
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,630
simply choose one of the properties that

506
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,020
can be animated like left right top

507
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,630
bottom margin padding whatever anything

508
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,460
that can be animated I can use as a

509
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,560
replacement so in this case I chose like

510
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,780
left for brightness as a replacement and

511
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,400
it can animate the left property and

512
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,960
yeah everything worked like intended so

513
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,910
the only thing I need to do in order to

514
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,390
get that done a little hack which is I

515
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:38,560
pass the CSS now using the rework path

516
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,970
or then I do some ASC transforms

517
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,290
introduce the custom properties

518
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,320
introduced for animated properties that

519
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,780
introduces fall backs and then serialize

520
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,060
the CSS again injected into the page it

521
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,860
gets applied to my device node then in

522
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,570
order to read all that out I have to

523
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,380
reverse all that so I have to use get

524
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,300
computed I could get in both cases left

525
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,890
property value and apply it to the DMX

526
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:12,460
devices as brightness in this case this

527
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,749
works pretty well only

528
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:19,389
all those doesn't really help to prepare

529
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,940
a light show simply because there's

530
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,460
never enough time to prepare if I only

531
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,509
have more time right so the last

532
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:32,409
comfortable I do that as I have like at

533
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:35,950
best two hours preparation time at the

534
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,659
band you're being connected to the DMX

535
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:41,080
devices and as it is I'm rarely

536
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,869
connected to such huge setups of DMX

537
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:46,359
divisor so most of the two hours are

538
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,789
spent fixing bugs and then I have maybe

539
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:53,679
like half an hour to program the light

540
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,859
and this is not something I want to live

541
00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:00,999
with and especially for this conference

542
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,159
I needed to come with samples come up

543
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:03,820
with something else

544
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,049
so I had from the awesome people that

545
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:10,539
were planning a layout of this

546
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:13,059
conference I guess it was like a month

547
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,519
ago or something like that these 3d

548
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,519
images of how the stage is supposed to

549
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,039
look and it's pretty much like that now

550
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:26,409
right so I started to think about what I

551
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:29,340
could do if I threw together basically

552
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:34,629
any software that I could find and the

553
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:39,099
end result is this so I have to build a

554
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:41,979
Mexican which is basically just coq10

555
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:51,639
for lecture and the nice thing about DMX

556
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:53,830
channels that I have those runner which

557
00:28:53,830 --> 00:29:01,060
usual 3GS and a frame will provide me

558
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,220
for the proper preview of what it might

559
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,350
look like on stage turns out it doesn't

560
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,260
really look like that because obviously

561
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,780
my colors are much brighter than the

562
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:17,210
real ones but yeah um to the left top um

563
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,290
you see the HTML or devices panel those

564
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,350
of the list of all the devices are found

565
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,850
over in the main hall so we have like

566
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,400
can a lot of these these spotlights here

567
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,180
and this LP the short for light panels

568
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,840
will be 2 by 2 meters panel there's 35

569
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,330
of them yeah I simply just got all the

570
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,910
channel numbers and so on from the

571
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,610
people at the venue when I arrived here

572
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:56,390
two days ago and yes that and this here

573
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,360
you'll see a CSS code that was actually

574
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,400
able I'd show so am a lot of mixer and

575
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,860
configuration basic settings things like

576
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,460
that and then there are the a1 is simply

577
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,250
on the top left bottom button and of

578
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,970
oppressive it will just run the color

579
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:22,220
animation that I defined there yeah and

580
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,300
finally they also got there was this

581
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,010
moving have spotlights which we can also

582
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:34,270
toggle and trigger and yeah

583
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,670
so nice to think about them just you

584
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,590
didn't see that because in order to see

585
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,179
this moving have spotlights you need a

586
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:42,640
lot of haze on or smoke in the room and

587
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,080
it's not good at the beginning of a

588
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,610
conference so that's at it looks much

589
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,950
better here reality bite if I only have

590
00:30:53,950 --> 00:31:02,230
enough time so um all of this and don't

591
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,600
judge me about this twelve megabytes of

592
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,910
JavaScript and it really uses everything

593
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,520
barriers basically so I have the code

594
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,070
Moreau editors Thanks for writing them I

595
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,470
know he's here somewhere

596
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,130
I used that Jes was actually actually an

597
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:26,290
ASM compiled version of look at CSS or

598
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,450
look that for something like that so I'm

599
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,000
using a fmjs as well I'm using a frame

600
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,250
from Mozilla what makes it really easy

601
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,300
to build these virtual reality

602
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,380
applications using three.js left here

603
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,160
and all of the other Souls III think

604
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,429
none of you also saw these libraries

605
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:50,440
ever thought it would be used that way

606
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,290
but thank you very much

607
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:59,510
[Applause]

608
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:03,780
and finally I left out all of the

609
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,660
details so if you want to know more I

610
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,810
will probably be giving slightly more

611
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,970
technical introduction and the community

612
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,580
area at large is due tomorrow

613
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:22,460
so thank you very much oh and one thing

614
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,770
we're going to do both now right we're

615
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,950
going to do this now oh there's more

616
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:37,350

I don't have the snippet all I'll get

648
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,610

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,530
show you that it's an actual software

655
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,210
that runs on electron because we didn't

656
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,800
change the logo there we also kind of

657
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,450
use a hack where that's like an express

658
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,850
DEP inside this electron app just to get

659
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,429
MIDI support or something I know it was

660
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,200

one file

682
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:56,460
why'd you write modular code well people

683
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,180
got mad when I put it all in one file

684
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:09,310
[Music]

gonna say things which are going to be

690
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,350
shocking and hurtful

691
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,670
which are not directed at you at all

692
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,650
javascript is a hot mess all they can do

693
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:47,099
is add forth and they're busy doing

694
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:49,690
that's the worst API ever developed in

695
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,539
history that's why the gold standard is

696
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:57,430
on now the problem with now the problem

697
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,819
with is everybody knows right with JSON

698
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,039
that when you get a huge payload from

699
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,619
the server what is in there

700
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:09,769
what what what what is in there I don't

701
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,599
know we gained something that not

702
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,719
because free shaking what huh I didn't

703
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:17,660
really get that reshapes free free shake

704
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,299
because we need small turn but no one

705
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:23,180
understand it's tradition it's just some

706
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,339
generic information you know not scary

707
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:26,690
at all

708
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,910
higher-order question you know the smell

709
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,829
scary at all which ends with a function

710
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:33,380
in function etc you know scary at all

711
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,680
flow of data employed when helpless is a

712
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,229
program kind of like the concepts of

713
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:45,130
time or return to the scoreboard

714
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,119
JavaScript because of that will be the

715
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,869
goodness has unexpectedly become the

716
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,609
world's most popular functional

717
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:57,979
programming you want to do everything

718
00:37:57,979 --> 00:38:52,339
with there's more there's totally more

719
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:53,760
