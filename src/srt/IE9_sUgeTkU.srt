00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,650

[Applause]

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,870
yeah hello everyone my name is Kasper I

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,120
come from Poland so not that far away

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,550
I've been loved in this city for it for

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,290
a quite long time and it's always a

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,089
pleasure to come back to Budapest I love

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,220
the city really and I'm here today to

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,050
talk about a little bit about security

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,090
and to talk about security in the

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,410
context of JavaScript applications so

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,810
every once in a while the big news break

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,910
out that some of the some of the leading

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,059
companies got hacked right millions of

14
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:34,860
credit card details personal data got

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,930
leaked people get anxious before being

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,180
angry the the reputation of the

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,090
company's got undermined and if you look

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,940
closely it it seems that there are some

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,700
technology giants that get those kind of

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,370
problems and for me it can only mean one

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:50,850
thing

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,500
that security is really really hard and

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,329
I don't know if you've heard about this

24
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,280
product

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,379
they got hacked like in 2011 and they

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,780
probably they lost some credit card

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,930
details so the hackers could use them to

28
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,189
you know to use your credit card to buy

29
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,920
different different things and it's

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,759
estimated that Sony lost 171 million

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,700
dollars in as a consequence right

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,320
because they had to they had to first

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
fix the issue the PlayStation Network

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,430
was down for some time and then they

35
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,909
have to you know pay the insurances like

36
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,360
make refunds and stuff like that so it's

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,900
really really important to know that you

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,909
can load your company can lose a lot of

39
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,610
money not to mention reputation right

40
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,270
but but but you can lose a lot of money

41
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,420
if you get security wrong but the the

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,549
things I'm talking about are mostly

43
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,030
 related we probably most of us

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,219
related we probably most of us
here are front-end developers there are

45
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,719
probably some back-end developers but

46
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,240
I'm gonna focus on front right now and

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,540
we usually don't deal with with

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,899
databases with with user data because we

49
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,679
do front ends right and we are safe so

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,030
we shouldn't be talking about security

51
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,780
and

52
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,080
it turns out that nope we are in safe we

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,390
are insecure and does anyone of you know

54
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,440
this guy no so so cool because it's a

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,260
very very cool story his name is Sammy

56
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,959
come car and he wrote a fastest

57
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,170
spreading virus ever using javascript

58
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,300
yeah really

59
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,850
that's the VPD uh page of this and he a

60
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,140
huge huge javascript to write a virus

61
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,030
that spread on myspace myspace was a

62
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,880
like Facebook back then sorry for the

63
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,769
images I couldn't find any better but

64
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,140
the virus wasn't really that harmful it

65
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,320
just sent the friend invitation to many

66
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,100
different people so it just sent coming

67
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,660
a semi invitation from many different

68
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,970
people and just posted some random posts

69
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,319
like Sammy's or some person like this

70
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,380
and he ended up having this many pages

71
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,550
of friend requests so so that was that

72
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,180
was pretty you know that the virus went

73
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,750
went crazy went really viral and as a

74
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,519
consequence he went to jail he they they

75
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,610
made him they made him pay some some

76
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,620
money as a compensation and they also he

77
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,170
also had some had to do some public

78
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,650
service so yeah that was really that was

79
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,440
really that was treated really seriously

80
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,890
and by the way if you don't know Sammy

81
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,570
you should definitely check out his

82
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,630
github page because he's done security

83
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,190
research I don't approve the thing he

84
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,140
done with he has done with with MySpace

85
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,519
but still he is now a security

86
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,459
researcher and he does a really cool

87
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,180
stuff and one might ask how how was

88
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,120
Sammy able to to get this virus running

89
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,620
and he used a technique called

90
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,660
cross-site scripting and probably most

91
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,950
of you are familiar with cross-site

92
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,040
scripting but I will quickly recap so

93
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,250
cross-site scripting is a vulnerability

94
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,609
that lets the attacker execute any kind

95
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:17,820
of code any kind of any kind of code in

96
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,940
the context of our our webpage right and

97
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,460
what does it really mean it does mean

98
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,430
that attacker is able to still cook

99
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,250
still local storage data basically the

100
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,530
attackers are able to do anything we

101
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,690
would do as a programmers in a context

102
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,910
of our webpage and if you want to learn

103
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,560
more about cross-site scripting there is

104
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,900
this great resource called Ava's because

105
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,190
there are some kind of there are many

106
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,720
kinds of cross-site scripting attacks

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,750
there are many techniques to to defend

108
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,610
ourselves against the cross description

109
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,289
attacks so we should go to or spend and

110
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,600
learn about them and I've prepared a

111
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,130
demo so I will show you how to how to do

112
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:06,989
a cross-site scripting attack

113
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:13,230
all right so

114
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,760
so imagine we are an attacker we are a

115
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,050
hacker and you want to hack into this

116
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,500
blog right this is a blog like you know

117
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,780
we have a blog post here you can go and

118
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,020
read it and what would I do as a hacker

119
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,090
to try to hack this i crack this blog I

120
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:37,490
would probably go and see like this in

121
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,820
WordPress right try to hack it as it was

122
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,200
WordPress it turns out it's not in

123
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,920
WordPress and then I would look for more

124
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,890
interesting parts and I would go to some

125
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,220
like this admin oh well there's an admin

126
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,830
login for example and probably admin has

127
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,670
some yes there is probably an admin

128
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,830
panel that would be interesting from an

129
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,710
attacker standpoint and our goal right

130
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,450
now is to hack into this panel it

131
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,980
happens that I know the login password I

132
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:16,130
will just show you what's in panel yeah

133
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,890
sound like this and our intention would

134
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,110
be to hack into this panel without

135
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,560
knowing any kind of password or login

136
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,710
any kind of credentials so what could I

137
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:35,850
do

138
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,870
it's not occur I would go to the to my

139
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,850
to the to the website I would like to

140
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,760
hack and I would look for possible input

141
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,620
points like for example let's go to the

142
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,540
post because posts usually have a

143
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,750
comment section and it turns out that

144
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,730
there is this comment section and you

145
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,120
can what we can do is we can try to put

146
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:05,130
some HTML here

147
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:14,330
whoa something broke sorry on handle

148
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,410
there yeah yeah demo that's right

149
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:34,160
yeah let's just start it again sorry we

150
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:47,860
would just have to

151
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,060
it just worked it worked like five

152
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,770
minutes ago so demo gods right yeah

153
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,290
let's do this one more time

154
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:05,780
first yeah yeah the restart is always a

155
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,200
good thing

156
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,690
yeah and it works and as you can see

157
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,200
I've typed it Iife there a bold tag

158
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,600
right and as you can see the browser

159
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,020
read it as HTML and executed so what I

160
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,550
can do is I can try to put a script

161
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:36,730
doctor and see what happens right

162
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,180
and as you can see the script got

163
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,090
executed that's right so that's my

164
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,430
that's my that's my security

165
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,920
vulnerability like I can abuse and right

166
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,860
now I would assume that the session is

167
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,470
stored in cookies I would use this hall

168
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,600
to steal the cookies and my code for

169
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,590
stealing cookies would look something

170
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,900
like this here's my code

171
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,440
it's called hack yeah yeah is it

172
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,050
readable from from the back yeah so

173
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,170
basically what I'm what I want to do is

174
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,890
I want to get my cookies and send them

175
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,930
to my server so then I can you know

176
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,560
somehow get them and login into the into

177
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,070
the admin panel assuring that the admin

178
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,450
of the webpage would eventually go to

179
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,700
the poll go to the post and try to read

180
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,520
it right so that's my script and I'm I

181
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,310
would just add an image tag to my web

182
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,050
page and add like special guide

183
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,050
parameters the image wouldn't load but I

184
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,080
still get a request in the and in this

185
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,580
cookie parameter I would get encoded

186
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,110
cookies right and that's great so if we

187
00:09:51,110 --> 00:10:01,070
post it

188
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:15,190
my server is down but no worries

189
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,810
Yeah right so right now as you can see

190
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,720
it says only great article thanks but it

191
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,670
tries to send some cookie to my server

192
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,320
which it didn't because the server

193
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
wasn't running but when i refresh it

194
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
probably will yeah and it did because

195
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,170
I'm already logged in as an admin you

196
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,780
see I got the request here and this

197
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:42,080
encoded thing is my cookie so now when I

198
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:53,990
copy this an open new separate window as

199
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,090
you can see I'm not logged in but when I

200
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,700
try to set my cookie here I prepare a

201
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:13,520
little snippet here and if I add my

202
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:22,430
cookies yeah it just set the cookies in

203
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,440
my in my current current browser window

204
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,180
and if I go to admin panel I've logged

205
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,250
in right and I didn't know any passwords

206
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,600
because it's like completely separate

207
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,320
page so the attack went like this I just

208
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,850
found the security cross-site scripting

209
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,650
hole then I planted the script that

210
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,600
stole every cookie from the website and

211
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,670
then I used those cookies to get into

212
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,980
the admin panel so that's pretty scary

213
00:11:45,980 --> 00:12:00,790
and let's go back to the slides

214
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,000
so yeah and I know that this demo was a

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,980
little bit exaggerated because normally

216
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,529
you would use something which is called

217
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,850
HTTP only cookies that I wouldn't be

218
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,560
able to read them if you want to keep

219
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,270
the session in cookies you should you

220
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,940
should use HTTP only cookies but I I

221
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,800
disable this feature for a purpose

222
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,390
because I wanted to show that it's

223
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,190
really easy to steal some malicious data

224
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,339
from the user some personal data from

225
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,700
the user and then abuse it somehow and

226
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,470
how do we say so one might say that I

227
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,050
should always filter the input from my

228
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,260
users and use sanitizer so just and

229
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,440
strip every HTML tag that is posted to

230
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,020
the comment section and that's true but

231
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,660
it turns out that those parsers could

232
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,100
have bugs and there are really really

233
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,260
sophisticated bugs but still that there

234
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,060
are bugs and on the other hand there is

235
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,709
a better way of protecting ourselves

236
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,010
against those kinds of attacks and this

237
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,149
method is called content security policy

238
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,510
and content security policy is nothing

239
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,930
more than a whitelist which let us

240
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,149
define from which lets us define the

241
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,370
URLs from which our browser is allowed

242
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,230
to download some resources so for

243
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,540
example I can take tell hey browser you

244
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,240
are allowed to download download stuff

245
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,279
from bootstrap from Facebook but you're

246
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,640
forbidden to download anything from from

247
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,860
different resources right and not only

248
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,579
content security policy lets us define

249
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,740
what we can download it also it also

250
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,770
lets us define how do we want to how do

251
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,480
we want our scripts to be executed so

252
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,060
for example we can say that we can

253
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,860
execute the script using like we can we

254
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,709
can we can allow the browser to run the

255
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,990
scripts addit using source attribute

256
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,260
like this and we can say we don't like

257
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,690
inline scripts so we want to disband

258
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,329
them and browser what would wouldn't

259
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:03,120
wouldn't even wouldn't even execute this

260
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,870
code and contrast security policy is

261
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,050
turned on using HTTP headers we just

262
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,670
specify on

263
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,880
our server we specify we specify the

264
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,890
content security policy header which

265
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,170
looked like this it's here we have

266
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,500
header coverage policy then we have

267
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,990
something called directive in this case

268
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,630
it's script if it defines from which

269
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,950
resources we can you can download

270
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,280
download script and there is a URL list

271
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,590
which says we can execute scripts from

272
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,690
and download scripts from self which is

273
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,780
our domain and from Google as simple as

274
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,140
that so having this knowledge that we

275
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,120
can try to fix our demo so the attack I

276
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,040
presented you wouldn't be wouldn't be

277
00:14:47,040 --> 00:15:01,800
even possible alright so here's my

278
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,300
server code and it's like basically

279
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,620
really basic really basic really basic

280
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,110
Express app which uses this this really

281
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,460
neat package called content security

282
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,100
policy and here are my content security

283
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,780
policy rules there are a couple of them

284
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,640
I'm specifying the the resources that my

285
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,470
page uses so I can use only scripts from

286
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,760
source self and there is a couple of

287
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,160
things I've added here because my web

288
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,800
page requires bootstrap and some google

289
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,540
fonts right so when I use this

290
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:44,019
middleware

291
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:57,710
and restart my server

292
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,870
and go back to my webpage I would have

293
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,589
to oh and as you can see my browser

294
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,920
refused to apply in line in line of its

295
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:16,300
inline script actually yeah so it's here

296
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,579
all right so as you can see my script

297
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,740
didn't get executed because it refused

298
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,149
my content security policy which says

299
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,339
that I can only download scripts which

300
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:27,040
are from my from my own domain and not

301
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,170
only did it block my inline script which

302
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,790
is not explicitly defined in my content

303
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,360
security policy rows it also it also

304
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,459
gave me this this nice report here that

305
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,250
says that somebody tried to try to hack

306
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,100
into my web page and we can specify the

307
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,620
content security policy rule to send

308
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,050
this report to to our to our back-end

309
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,240
and then we can filter those reports and

310
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,220
see that somebody tried to hack us and

311
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,199
that's really neat and as far as I know

312
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,399
the sensoring the tool for getting blogs

313
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,139
is also supporting content security

314
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,089
policy right now so you can definitely

315
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:03,190
check it out and see whether somebody

316
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,600
tries to hack your site hack your

317
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,030
webpage so right now my attack would be

318
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,360
completely my attack will be completely

319
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,370
impossible because the script we we

320
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,319
planted before it's not exactly and

321
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:24,490
that's great

322
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,060
I'm sorry all right

323
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,240
so as I said before content security

324
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,520
policy lets you define many different

325
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,220
rules for for resources and we can

326
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,780
control almost everything like we can

327
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,910
control the WebSockets we can specify to

328
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,470
which servers web sockets are allowed to

329
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,970
connect we can specify the image

330
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,520
resources as you can see the Astra photo

331
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,930
didn't load because I didn't explicitly

332
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,360
tell the browser to allow it load it

333
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,390
right and security policy content

334
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,860
security policy is really really great

335
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,880
but it also has its downsides just look

336
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,510
at this it's the content security policy

337
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,000
header from Gmail right and there is

338
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,400
there is a lot of stuff here and it's

339
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,830
really really hard to make to maintain

340
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,170
those tools because imagine you are

341
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,940
using third-party scripts like analytic

342
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,250
scripts or Google tag manager or

343
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,640
something that that we have we have a

344
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,200
tag manager that downloads many

345
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,180
different resources from many different

346
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,160
domains and we didn't even we don't even

347
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,620
know from which domains we have from

348
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,300
which domains we load content to our web

349
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,790
page and to make them work we have to

350
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,680
explicitly define them in those rules

351
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,960
right because otherwise they won't be

352
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,470
working and as you can see this gets

353
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,150
pretty large and it hits both

354
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,710
performance because we had to load this

355
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,080
header and it's you know if we have that

356
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,540
many rules probably we are not safe

357
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,450
anyway because if some of the different

358
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,530
you know different different services

359
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,860
that we listed here get hacked we would

360
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,960
be affected as well so that's really

361
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,680
hard and if you try to use content

362
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,460
security policy right away your webpage

363
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,320
would probably break because it's really

364
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,570
really it's it's really really hard to

365
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,660
know the exact resources that your

366
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,450
webpage uses and there will be if you

367
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,680
turn on the content security policy

368
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,570
today you will be surprised how many of

369
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,510
things your webpage downloads right but

370
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,760
so there is one rule if you start a

371
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,560
project start using content security

372
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,960
policy as soon as possible because it

373
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,310
will give you the full control over your

374
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,120
resources another downside is that you

375
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,750
know I am building single page

376
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,789
applications

377
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:40,789
and we use webpack for building our own

378
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:43,460
for building the application itself and

379
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,109
we end up with a package that is

380
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:47,269
completely serverless we don't need any

381
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,460
servers we just want to deploy we just

382
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,470
want to deploy those three files and we

383
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,049
decided to use Amazon s3 right because

384
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,879
it's like come on come on use case we

385
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:56,960
just put those files from this tree

386
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,119
turned on static web site hosting

387
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,489
and we are done basically and it turns

388
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:07,039
out that Amazon s3 lets us define our

389
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,259
own headers so that's great because we

390
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,149
can use it to you know control cache and

391
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:13,609
we thought that it would be it would be

392
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:17,210
nice that we would be able to add

393
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,220
content security policy here so we would

394
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,229
actually we would get an architecture

395
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:23,029
that is completely that has no moving

396
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,950
parts we wouldn't have to maintain any

397
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:30,049
servers anything and it turned out when

398
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,960
we turned the CDN before ahead of the

399
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,190
head of the stream it turned out that s3

400
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,929
doesn't support content security policy

401
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:40,549
headers for some reason we don't know

402
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:42,619
why so we had to add an engineer's

403
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:46,669
before our Amazon s3 just to add those

404
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:49,070
headers and that's the another downside

405
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,440
of the content security policy is that

406
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,659
only a few hosting providers and city

407
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:55,009
and support those fellers I don't know

408
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,229
really why if you ask them nicely they

409
00:20:57,229 --> 00:20:58,700
would probably turn them on for you

410
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,609
but it's not by default and it's you

411
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,710
know it's really really hard and you

412
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,159
know to sum up what have we learned

413
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:07,429
today

414
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:10,759
yeah we recap to what continent what

415
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:13,369
cross-site scripting was we learned what

416
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,769
content security policy is and the most

417
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:18,289
important thing that I would like to I

418
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:21,169
would like to you to learn from my talk

419
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:24,049
is that security is really really hard

420
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,909
and we should always pay attention to it

421
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,659
because it's it's really important and

422
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:32,509
it can cost us a lot a lot of money and

423
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:34,970
a lot of and it can cause a lot of

424
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,190
trouble if we don't have security done

425
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,029
right and here are a couple of links you

426
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:43,099
can read afterwards and my name is
