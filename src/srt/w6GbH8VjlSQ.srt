1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,330

ah

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,200
I'm going to be talking about

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,910
progressive enhancement sounds kind of

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,300
like a boring topic cuz like we've heard

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,330
it so much but this is more about like

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,430
how you can really put html5 and css3

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,450
into use today there's a lot of people

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,710
that think that it's something that's

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,410
unstable we have to wait or people that

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,880
think that we should start all over

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,450
something like that but we can we can

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,860
use a lot of it now there are a lot of

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,160
advantages to trying out this stuff one

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,680
is you know a lot of stuff that these

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,570
specs represent is things that we were

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,820
doing and now it's making it into more

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,730
native abilities so with css3 for

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,940
instance we don't need images the we're

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,620
going to end up with a much lighter page

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,520
wait at the end of it and it looks damn

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,630
good additionally a lot of times it's

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,479
just you know nicer html5 form controls

23
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,100
I mean we can have a slider just by

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,649
saying infotype range a color picker

25
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:15,799
although it's not implemented but soon

26
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,549
there's a lot of things that we've been

27
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,069
relying on 60 kilobytes of JavaScript

28
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:23,219
for that now just comes baked in the

29
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,659
browser and performance is in many cases

30
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,399
much much better when you're looking at

31
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,590
something like CSS transitions or CSS

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,170
animation you're going to be getting a

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,990
much better quality performance than

34
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,840
then a javascript-based animation but

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,289
there's been problems and solutions have

36
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:49,590
come around so this is popularized as

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,459
the html5 Shiv can we just like agree

38
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:54,840
that we're going to call it a shim from

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,289
now on John Rezac who originally talked

40
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:01,350
about this method has now recanted and

41
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,770
says it's a shim so the basic problem is

42
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,889
that IE does not handle elements that it

43
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:10,950
doesn't know about correctly what it

44
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,050
does is you can't style it so like here

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,030
we have this blah element right we want

46
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,100
to color it red IE doesn't allow you to

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,810
style it and also won't hold anything

48
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,440
inside

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,540
so just like if you put other elements

50
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,160
inside of an unknown element it is like

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,380
barfs all those elements outside of it

52
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,920
into the Dom doesn't contain so the

53
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,510
trick is a document create element

54
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,910
somehow you do that and everything's

55
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,190
just groovy so that that's the one

56
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,500
problem that we found and that we solved

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,200
and then just recently as more people

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,240
started putting a html5 in two years we

59
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,400
realize that printing is a problem in

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,330
nie that the html5 shim doesn't it

61
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,890
doesn't work like the whole DOM is

62
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,780
recalculated when it when it goes into

63
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,010
print so on so unknown elements are just

64
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,690
like they get the exact same behavior

65
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,390
and the technique that we've been using

66
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,180
didn't work so this is news as of about

67
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,670
last week john neal figured out a

68
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,670
technique and basically it's um IE has

69
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,290
these nice some on before printing mound

70
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,060
after print events and what he basically

71
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,810
does is takes the entire dom and like

72
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,810
holds it cashed but then creates a

73
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,600
shadow Dom with with like dibs in place

74
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,239
of all the articles and sections and

75
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,090
unknown elements for IE and then that

76
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,480
gets sent to the print view and then it

77
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,150
gets reconstructed afterwards so that's

78
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,350
now solve to this this piece of code is

79
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,050
now in the html5 Shiv j/s that is on

80
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,670
google code Remy sharp maintains that

81
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,680
and it's um it's going to be in

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,930
modernizer as well I think one of the

83
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,390
things that you know I want to make

84
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,170
people get a feel for is is that we're

85
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,060
not waiting for like you know a spec the

86
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,880
the html5 spec or CSS respect to be done

87
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,350
it were really looking at features so

88
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,310
this is a site that uh uh can I click

89
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,139
that no

90
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,780
I can't oh yeah sweet um this is a site

91
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,460
that I worked on with my friend Divya

92
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,139
and and it's basically just a

93
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,499
representation of what's actually ready

94
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:54,680
to use sorry Wow cool so basically

95
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,479
representation of what our support looks

96
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,120
like in browsers for certain features

97
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,379
for instance font face has total support

98
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,120
everywhere the only the last browser

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,819
that didn't support at font-face was

100
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:11,150
Firefox three-point what is mostly dead

101
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,810
at this point things like cross-origin

102
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,330
resource sharing so basically you know

103
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,849
cross-domain Ajax we're good nighy eight

104
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:21,919
we're going to number where else and

105
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,779
there's a lot of other things that that

106
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:26,779
have really stable support web storage

107
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:29,979
is in ie8 and I a compatibility mode

108
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,430
along with everywhere else so basically

109
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,129
I mean look at the feature not not the

110
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:41,839
spec one of those is content editable

111
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,810
did raise your hand if you saw this demo

112
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,089
this is so rad so on a von kesteren made

113
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,279
this and I'm going to show you the

114
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,349
source first ok so there's nothing in

115
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:01,069
the body it's all in the head and in a

116
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,069
style tag he's said that he wants the

117
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,349
head the title tag and style tags to be

118
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,020
display block and then the body is going

119
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,729
to be displayed on and then the style

120
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,919
tag is going to be content editable so

121
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,009
what we're looking at here is the head

122
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,930
of the document we're not looking at the

123
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,899
body and the style tag is content

124
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:24,949
editable so I can just edit the whole

125
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:28,370
thing Sam in a color oh yeah

126
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,570
that looks good this is six come on

127
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,470
really no WebKit it would have worked in

128
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,080
Firefox anyways a pretty rad so content

129
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,630
editable is another one that I mean it's

130
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,270
good to go it's support it's been in it

131
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,610
was an IE original feature and basically

132
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,440
everyone has since adopted the IE

133
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,370
feature they do a lot of things right

134
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,760
Jeremy just showed this site but I'm

135
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,740
going to show you a little bit of what

136
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,010
it is underneath the covers so these are

137
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:12,300
a SVG pieces of art done with done with

138
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,200
Raphael and this is a full html5

139
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,590
validating css3 validating site thus

140
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,040
pieces of art are right here script a

141
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,170
text x artwork the the art is defined in

142
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,140
CoffeeScript and and the code that

143
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,050
basically grabs them and throws them

144
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,700
into Rafael and then sucks them into the

145
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,020
page is also doing in CoffeeScript

146
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,820
lincolnshire poacher this guy's

147
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,400
australian dude and it's like probably

148
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,660
the coolest site I've seen in a long

149
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,800
time yeah that little arrow is like a

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,310
Unicode arrow CSS transitions on it it's

151
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:05,820
so good it actually works in IE 6 so

152
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,630
it's pretty I mean it's impressive

153
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,500
there's been some tools that have come

154
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,910
out to kind of make something CZ er you

155
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,840
know one thing with css3 is that if you

156
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,340
start writing it you're like all these

157
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,280
vendor prefixes this is nice and dark

158
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,070
awesome vendor prefixes get pretty

159
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:29,040
annoying and so I put out this tool with

160
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,020
some friends that helps fix that so you

161
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,370
can just you know use your mouse wheel

162
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,030
or whatever get a live preview maybe

163
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,979
we'll want the Box shut it to be

164
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:47,230
I think magenta is a little bit nicer

165
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:58,190
yeah it's good mm yeah um but anyways uh

166
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,430
things like um I mean I II has had these

167
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:08,430
IE filters for a long time and they can

168
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,980
do you know full linear gradients and

169
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,019
that that's been supported since I don't

170
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,589
know like I for something so we have

171
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,490
kind of synchronized syntax here we

172
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,089
could also handle rgba or any sort of

173
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,139
rotation is done via matrix math it's

174
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,839
pretty rad stuff I wouldn't want to have

175
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,570
to figure out how it works but it does

176
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,660
it so you don't have to and transitions

177
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,449
are I mean it's just like you know

178
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:43,290
everything that's on this page is like

179
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,170
an animated transition and all that was

180
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,850
needed to define that was just these

181
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,589
three lines well only this line really

182
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,699
we also have browser support listed on

183
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:55,560
this site so you know what you're

184
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,800
getting coverage is really good there's

185
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,290
a few other border-radius calm as pretty

186
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,519
sweet also border image calm for slicing

187
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,310
up doing a nine slice representation of

188
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,600
an image but then the challenge is with

189
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,610
a lot of these what happens when there's

190
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,880
actually no support in the browser you

191
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,790
want you want to be able to basically

192
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,860
catch that case and act accordingly if

193
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,899
you know for instance abort if border

194
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,449
image isn't supported in the browser you

195
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:34,500
want to know because you're probably

196
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,300
going to use a different technique so

197
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,269
that is why I work on a JavaScript

198
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,209
library called moderniser the basic idea

199
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,740
behind modernizer that does feature

200
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,480
detection so we're not actually doing a

201
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,449
user agent sniff and then saying oh well

202
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,069
we know that this browser supports this

203
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:51,880
because that's I mean is in

204
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,550
future-proof you know system so use

205
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,960
feature detection and actually test

206
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,900
everything user agent sniffing is not

207
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,000
cool how many people like went to do

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,970
there turbotax in like chrome and got

209
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,170
this page yeah sucks I was like really

210
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,680
and like yeah so they support safari and

211
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,160
and their user agent sniff didn't even

212
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,680
pick up chrome it's terrible so yeah

213
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,840
couldn't couldn't fill out my taxes in

214
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,860
my favorite browser the way that

215
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,190
modernize their works I'm gonna pull up

216
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:38,650
a the code of modernizer real quick as

217
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:43,100
that it does a bunch of tests um let's

218
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:49,850
grab one some of the tests are really

219
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,220
nasty okay so here's some cool ones so

220
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,390
this is a doing a test for html5 video

221
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,280
we create a video element and then we

222
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,350
see if there's a can play type method

223
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,500
that exists on it if it does that

224
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,480
basically we have support for it so

225
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,680
we're going to do a couple more checks

226
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,720
to basically see if there's it what

227
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,260
codec support we have in each of the in

228
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,510
audio and video this one's nice because

229
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,840
basically we were provided with an API

230
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,110
that says what do you support a lot of

231
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,660
the times that's not the case things

232
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,730
like session storage and local storage

233
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,820
can get really cranky like if you

234
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,220
disable them cookies you can actually

235
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,920
get exceptions thrown in Firefox when

236
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,860
you're doing a basic test for this so

237
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,930
there's a lot of real like edge case

238
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,040
stuff that we work around so we do a lot

239
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,140
of feature feature tests here and then

240
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,450
that gets that gets exposed to you as a

241
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,420
developer in two different ways we throw

242
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,280
classes on to the HTML tag and so

243
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,950
basically we have like you know this

244
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,320
browser supports canvas but it does

245
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,940
not support geolocation so you can just

246
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,680
style based on that maybe you're going

247
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,110
now going to show the little input box

248
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,100
where you can put in your zip code

249
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,050
because you're not able to query for the

250
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,850
geolocation the other thing is we create

251
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,170
a big JavaScript object with a bunch of

252
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,240
bullion's and the Codex and now you can

253
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,830
just like tests so the way that works

254
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,540
out you have something like border

255
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,850
radius and if there is a native support

256
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,170
you're going to use it but if there's no

257
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,940
border radius support maybe you're going

258
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,830
to like initialize a JavaScript library

259
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,060
that's going to do the rounded corners

260
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,620
or whatever something like box-shadow if

261
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,680
supports there hell yeah if there's not

262
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,610
it will make some mimicked like borders

263
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,380
on the side and bottom make it look

264
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,430
decent another idea is this is like a

265
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,360
geolocation geolocation bridge so way

266
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,530
that we use it was just going to call it

267
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,510
throw a call back to get location and

268
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,670
output where we're at inside of it we're

269
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,620
going to check make sure see if we have

270
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,270
native support if we are great we're

271
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,660
going to use that otherwise going to

272
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,360
grab the Google JavaScript API which

273
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,000
just that just requesting this file

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,720
gives you a client location data that

275
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,510
includes the Latin long and I think

276
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,860
city-state it's pretty good and free

277
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,460
modernize our small it's great it's got

278
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,820
F's assload of tests for all sorts of

279
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,810
 and also I think you know using I

280
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,320
and also I think you know using I
think the way that exposes the

281
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,820
information to you as a developer is

282
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,740
ideal but please steal the tests I mean

283
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,970
they're nice little atomic tests and you

284
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,860
can just gank it out and use that one

285
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,600
test if you if all you're looking for is

286
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,430
is their session storage support in this

287
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:59,020
browser that's Totally Rad Wow okay to

288
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,250
websites need to look exactly the same

289
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,200
in every browser no do they need to be

290
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,550
experienced exactly the same at every

291
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,690
browser no html5 ready yet no it's

292
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,460
 hey that's one

293
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,290
hey that's one
such this is good yeah your mom

294
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,140
does not check what websites she likes

295
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:24,410
look like in other browsers no see talk

296
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,450
a little bit here I'm yeah about them

297
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,260
basically how to talk to clients about

298
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,680
this I think the main way to talk to

299
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,930
clients about the fact that you want to

300
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,000
encourage a more progressively enhanced

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,700
thing is that emphasized I mean I mean

302
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,620
us as as front-end developers need to

303
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,660
emphasize that we value responsiveness

304
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,450
and the user experience for the for the

305
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,330
site and for the site's users as much as

306
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,840
possible and we want to preserve a

307
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,470
really perform and experience and adding

308
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,040
you know border rounding scripts to the

309
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,790
page for IE 6 and 7 is just not not

310
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,820
going to make the page any faster so

311
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,340
really talking about how we can make

312
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,110
decisions to to enforce that the page is

313
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,940
actually going to be performant and work

314
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,470
well in a clerk said or do you prefer me

315
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,360
to spend my time pack around issues on

316
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,760
all the technologies like I a 6 or would

317
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,170
you like that time spent making the site

318
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,670
look the best that it can on other

319
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,340
desktop browsers as well as I devices

320
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,090
and 12 will devices I mean that's really

321
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,010
that's really what we need to make clear

322
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,560
to our clients that this is the this is

323
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,320
the toss up right here I just have a few

324
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,160
demos using some of these features so

325
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,830
this is content editable and and it also

326
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,220
uses a WebKit mask image and then WebKit

327
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,850
a fill color of transparent and then

328
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,620
what WebKit text stroke on the edges so

329
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,550
it's all CSS there's no javascript uh is

330
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,470
this a reference implementation for ours

331
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,990
I should look like yeah yeah yes this is

332
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,740
this is exactly how they sure look

333
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:34,730
05 sweet um yeah let's see this um this

334
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,679
is pretty sweet I was really excited

335
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:38,440
when i did this except for the blinking

336
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,420
so I stole Mike Taylor's canvas demo so

337
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:47,179
I'm drawing on canvas but then I'm out

338
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,970
putting it I'm saving the canvas every

339
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,940
time it changes as a data URI and then

340
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,820
i'm using that data URI as a WebKit mask

341
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,809
image to basically reveal the HTML

342
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:01,970
content that's underneath so it's just

343
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,059
like standard HTML underneath it and we

344
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:08,150
just have a custom mask that I'm drawing

345
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,870
myself Chris yeah and yeah cheeseburger

346
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:22,750
so good oh and in honor of J's conf whoa

347
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:35,570
not cool dude yeah it's no pirate from

348
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:40,040
from web dings and so this is a text

349
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,510
shadow and it does use JavaScript so it

350
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,970
just changes the text shadow and makes

351
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,410
it more blurry as it goes away um

352
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,809
anyways I thought I had less time than

353
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:57,080
this I'm done

354
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:07,770
whatever uh yeah that's it I got a

355
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,370
question for you what's up um

356
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,290
performance start up time for modern

357
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,920
ideas for moderniser we're looking at it

358
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,930
all the tests run in somewhere between

359
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,830
30 and 90 milliseconds each canister

360
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,070
total total yeah it's quick I want to

361
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,900
keep it I mean I really want to keep it

362
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,220
