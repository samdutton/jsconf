1
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,849

nervous and definitely we can burn water

2
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:27,119
which is this really cool start up a new

3
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,869
system blows up well he gave my day was

4
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,730
here from Iman inevitable and I'll talk

5
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,750
a little bit of a low GS and our music

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,760
there's some distributed systems yes the

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,080
shameless blood as that I am Emelianenko

8
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,239
coaster and you should all check out

9
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,190
their web page because we do have some

10
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,979
pretty cool so what we do we could

11
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,470
Maggie so protesting which means we take

12
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,440
away cake how do you modify we mr. in

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,400
Jeff's report even more yet magic and

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,100
have a bunch of servers and I'm going to

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,860
talk about service so what's the server

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,090
we have this in the beginning one very

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,909
monolithic huge no TS server and it does

18
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,119
contain it Francis requests from several

19
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,049
sources it serves our clients choosing

20
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,630
in there and vaginas it does all sort of

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,689
things we talked to many is in the past

22
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,039
now we're talking mostly these ones

23
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,460
you're happy

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,610
amazone center for now so that's y SI es

25
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,440
original system so yeah it's a big huge

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,720
why I don't have lay down how big no GST

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,880
wishes are getting these days but it's

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,270
around 50k line of code oh it was

29
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,220
actually working for educators and the

30
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,090
en suite red is almost 1k flights every

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,790
crevice we want to freeze all your boat

32
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,390
motors dependencies and dependencies of

33
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,580
the Pegasus they displayed by quickly so

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,640
yes we consider it up a nice application

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,450
so they are arbiter of my blanket

36
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,700
because I working mostly certified let's

37
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,140
make this thing is simple and makes

38
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,480
super by breaking thing which is for me

39
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,140
a beautiful condition because it should

40
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,140
make in important variable is small

41
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,299
thing not to worry how they competition

42
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,430
so I just

43
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,700
so this real applications their program

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,739
are going over the mother brain of the

45
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,500
error problem and they are harder to get

46
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,209
right because there's so many ways I

47
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,230
think of doing it wrong and so forth so

48
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,480
on so what did i do what did we do we

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,250
took something and ready words which is

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,109
you know the body ache I think so

51
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:11,920
where's subject baby and it works on

52
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,459
change is hey to be one point straight

53
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:21,949
super and that's why we use it for us

54
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,620
and we're going what I call the service

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,000
and yes I cannot name it what it does it

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,879
is streamate you know he management

57
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,629
remote dependencies I optician it has

58
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:44,769
the bodies nice one point so they come

59
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:49,120
out and they go down people remove what

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,449
we try this magic in the code and all

61
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:58,690
that because I like sugar any like sugar

62
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,419
I like to just sit down and worry about

63
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:05,979
the business like I don't I'm done again

64
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,189
in the most complicated way so we wrote

65
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:16,060
this way this layer on top of vino and

66
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,049
just go back to like how I campaign

67
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:20,400
things I cannot even named things

68
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,200
manually like this kind of so maybe

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,110
think this is really annoying and you

70
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,940
have a lower Earth and Mars and you

71
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,790
still trying to name the object of it

72
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,180
name is Emily will be annoying to get it

73
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,210
right party so this has been going since

74
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,540
the 97 make for our support when

75
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:52,610
anything's wrong with Rachel so we have

76
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,760
necessity s.s.d.d to Microsoft and then

77
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,960
we have homeroom everybody knows and we

78
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,000
have SLP which is this thing from 97

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,980
actually which is actually very nice you

80
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,630
have attributes you have a multicast

81
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,080
unique as if it's a really broad

82
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,940
encompassing implementation

83
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,229
specification but nobody uses of course

84
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,850
even dhcp has something for naming

85
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,400
objects st unbelievable so we end up

86
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,520
picking mdns why because it was there

87
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,540
ready and it just worked and i work this

88
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:40,110
work is in quotes mdns on apple machine

89
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,419
will use the bunch of implementation and

90
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,180
it will work flawlessly but on a limited

91
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,860
machine it will use the valley

92
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,460
implementation and there is this lead

93
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,840
compat mdns on top of a vine and that's

94
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,700
a very messy piece of code I know if

95
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,530
anyone here had the experience of mdns

96
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,270
there is a node module which we use call

97
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,080
mdns it's super simple to use it you

98
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,930
just register something you give it a

99
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,470
name you can browse it later and it will

100
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:19,520
find using multicast on on specific IP

101
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,080
the thing about mdns and because it uses

102
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,760
this lib compat is that you get lots of

103
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,630
error on

104
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,870
no I don't know about this unknown thing

105
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,660
like who came up but it should be very

106
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,300
rare that you get an error unknown maybe

107
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,060
something like a cosmic ray flipping a

108
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,010
bit then it might be an error unknown

109
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,520
but in mdns case because of lead combat

110
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,500
you get tons of our own nose like if the

111
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,330
P thread fails or memory location

112
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,350
allocation fails or some other avahi

113
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,650
related error happens it bubbles up to

114
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,490
to us to the OGS implementation as an

115
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,420
error unknown so we are moving away from

116
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,250
from this because we have this in

117
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,320
production by the way it is this all

118
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,140
this I'm talking here we have a running

119
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,420
on Amazon or on virtual appliances and

120
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,920
we what I'm going to do is eventually

121
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,150
implement multiple engines a bit like

122
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,240
socket i/o has this down grain or

123
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,100
engineer has this upgrade procedure of

124
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,430
trying one engine and going up trying

125
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,770
different ones this is my current goal

126
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,490
so a bit of an example so because

127
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,960
because of timing i don't know if there

128
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,780
will be time for for demo I think maybe

129
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,500
I the thing commented out is is the

130
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,080
that's the example take it straight from

131
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,510
denote website and I just committed out

132
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,350
the differences which is required and

133
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,690
and how you create it so is I give it

134
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,630
this with this name here called d1 and

135
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,850
is the same function and instead of

136
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,370
picking up a port I just do a start and

137
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,440
this will pick up automatically a port

138
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,650
it will use the whatever announcement

139
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,710
advertisement engine in this case mdns

140
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,950
it will broadcast the port to anyone

141
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,530
interested in this in this service this

142
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,260
service has no versioning so whenever

143
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,560
you search for it it will just fine but

144
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,340
there is a versioning support so this is

145
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,630
soon this is not rocket science by far

146
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,310
there are other projects in fact this

147
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,740
this thing is been working for a couple

148
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,900
of months now there was another project

149
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,110
called hookah

150
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,519
by maroc I think and it does it this

151
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,229
thing has several like similarities with

152
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,510
that but it's not the same that and

153
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,529
because who kayo seem to have to die

154
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,959
down I didn't really see that much

155
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,380
activity or I chose to implement this

156
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,510
even simpler object registration for

157
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:09,070
Strings so declare the defocus you get

158
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,390
the client you just say oh give me a

159
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,779
servers and fine for me and denote for

160
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:19,420
that name which is d1 and then you call

161
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,000
as a as a GNote really seriously this is

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,510
the same you get the same objects back

163
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,510
nothing nothing seriously different but

164
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,640
this only only this server is boring

165
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,510
right it's not doing much what I want is

166
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,540
remote dependencies why because looking

167
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,260
back our problems are requesting usually

168
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,120
involves talking to several API several

169
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,490
external things I'll go to check this

170
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,260
mixed panel thing and go to the database

171
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,199
and you know many external tools and

172
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:56,380
api's to interface with and all of them

173
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,320
they have errors and we found out

174
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,430
through painful moments that error

175
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,339
handling is really not that simple and

176
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,500
easy when you talk into these multiple

177
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,660
sources you have timeouts everywhere you

178
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,000
have all sorts of things and the code

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,220
gets uglier bulkier so what what I want

180
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,899
is like I want dependencies I want

181
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,940
automatic dependencies on these small

182
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,550
services see if and I want two types

183
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,380
hardness soft dependency heart

184
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,240
dependencies if one service goes down I

185
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,089
want the whoever is depending on that to

186
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,550
go down as well and a soft is well it's

187
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,529
not it's just you can continue so of

188
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,810
course it's up to the programmer to 22

189
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,880
gauge what is the soft dependency what

190
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,510
is in a hard dependency but yeah so this

191
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,399
is how you implement the second server

192
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,649
service called d2 and it has a different

193
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,600
function instead of it explore this GS

194
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:49,900
com

195
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,200
here and the only difference is it has

196
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,960
this server does rely on d1 and this is

197
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,160
a hard dependency so d 2 goes up

198
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,590
whenever d1 goes up this guy is notified

199
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,210
and it also goes up do you want goes

200
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,430
down if there are no no other d ones in

201
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,210
the vicinity this guy will go down as

202
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,420
well and yeah that's this is the type of

203
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,130
sugar that I that I like I don't have to

204
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,040
really worry about like implementing

205
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,120
custom event handlers and checking these

206
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,920
things and of course again there's like

207
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,700
a timeout handling retries the load

208
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,350
balancing it will try different

209
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,300
endpoints according to reach riders

210
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,250
couple of metrics sorry yeah so what is

211
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,130
the working progress is cycle detection

212
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,130
which is fairly simple these multiple

213
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,820
engines in cases the advertisement is

214
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,170
advertising agents engines SLP is the 1

215
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,390
i'm coding now i started two days ago

216
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,690
there's a library called open SLP and in

217
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,720
implements the then-new the latest RFC

218
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,370
for SLP and that should be done soon

219
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,780
actually if anyone wants to help i

220
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,790
really like that but really appreciate

221
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:12,190
and it's a c++ native module and this

222
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,130
thing is which is a hack is I want to

223
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,010
just to add this small remote dependency

224
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,870
in the package.json and basically have

225
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,620
these two to be that rely so I can code

226
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,250
small npm modules and having the

227
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,230
package.json their remote dependency so

228
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,330
i can just lounge that npm module and

229
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,490
have addy service to automatically

230
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,020
already do the real I that registration

231
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,570
maybe even simpler isn't like just more

232
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,600
sugar but yeah even simpler to to manage

233
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,880
so I have these extra I know if I have

234
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,970
time maybe I won't have time so this is

235
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,070
the transact the stream part do you know

236
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,470
this stream based but streams are not

237
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,170
the end all they don't cure all illness

238
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,000
like students are composable they're

239
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,830
really cool but there is one thing that

240
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,760
we like

241
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,570
is a repeatable operations and it's it's

242
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,110
at some point you will buffer things

243
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,320
because you have to repeat so of course

244
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,920
you could do the absurd which is an

245
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,620
operation fail retry then operation fail

246
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,660
retry retry until you get to the end

247
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,730
user and you get an alert to him like

248
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,040
algae's repressive submit on the form

249
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,550
again but that's not really nice so at

250
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,130
some point in your on your pipeline you

251
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,770
will buffer something and retry later do

252
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,020
this later is could be in a millisecond

253
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,100
or seconds later so transactions are

254
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,170
kind of required and we do have another

255
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,840
implementation which is all I call a

256
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,160
pipeline but I don't know if that's the

257
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,680
correct name which is basically a chain

258
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,570
of operation steps and these steps are

259
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,530
and funny if I know fancy word it then

260
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,840
potent so you you must be sure that you

261
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,030
can call that thing multiple times and

262
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,230
it will give you the same answer and

263
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,090
what it does is you you will see realize

264
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,820
your comment some call you will have one

265
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,760
input and one working q / first step so

266
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,350
you implement a small a small function

267
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,840
that is processed something and this

268
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,030
working Q is what guarantees you that

269
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,480
you can retry operation safely so we use

270
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,540
right now readies but there is also a

271
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:33,070
kestrel in darner darner implementation

272
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,670
which is just fast faster castro in c++

273
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,930
and what you have is you have this

274
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,910
working q atomic operations so you even

275
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,770
if you fail if you timeout or whatever

276
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,710
you can completely kill the service put

277
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,960
it back up and it will automatically do

278
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,240
the recovery for you given that your

279
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,740
step is it the impotence so it's it's

280
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,620
not a problem and we have this in

281
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,080
production as well as really yeah simple

282
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,880
I won't have time to show I'm sorry so

283
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,400
everything will be open source I got the

284
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,140
approval from from the overlords and

285
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:27,720
yep I thank you thank you
