00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:13,349

good afternoon okay we start now because

2
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,430
we have somebody waiting for the first

3
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,210
session so good afternoon as a very

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,650
short introduction to the work and a

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,050
torque today I would like to introduce

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,769
you to two later a number that are as a

7
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,489
root of our visit in Berlin today which

8
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:36,850
are for the body is making since a very

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,729
long time software programming software

10
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:44,500
in client server and desktop environment

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,519
with a consistent philosophy which is

12
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:52,360
developing simple pragmatic predictive

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,930
tools to develop and deploy business

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,449
application so body is a small large

15
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,500
software company we are based in Paris

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,270
but represented all over the world and

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,869
we address small medium sized businesses

18
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,310
of course we we have since many years

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,920
many web in web tools integrated in our

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,619
suite but one year ago we started

21
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:26,920
thinking but our knowledge our way of

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,789
work could bring an added value in the

23
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:34,420
pure web development area so we started

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,450
a new laboratory project which name is

25
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,189
Wakanda so what kinda I would have loved

26
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,700
to present you a new superhero because

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,969
we will have all of us super arrow but

28
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:51,429
in actually work and either is an

29
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:54,039
existing term in the Marvel Universe but

30
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,229
I'm very sorry it's it's a pure

31
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,740
coincidence and actually Wakanda we

32
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,920
chose this name because in the shoe

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,270
language it means in a magic and it's a

34
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,910
property it's a qualification for beings

35
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,460
things and butter

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,760
having internal magic power and we

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,330
thought it was a good a good

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,550
correspondence fitting with our goal and

39
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,930
the way we consider the the programming

40
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,680
activity so we started to build we built

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,610
a narrow ND team led by Lori Bhatia with

42
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,760
the funder of 4G actually and it's a

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,390
dedicated team which has been working in

44
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,370
the latest number of months on the

45
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,640
project is still continuing and today

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,370
it's a very first time we present the

47
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,230
project as it is today and so we are

48
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,090
very honored and excited about that to

49
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,650
get your feedback so i will let

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,380
introduce you to Alex on moco that will

51
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,100
show you some cool feature about what

52
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,870
kinda thank you hi I'm Alexandra ago I

53
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,600
was very excited when for they contacted

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,230
me to say we want to make a new web

55
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,930
application maker ok we want in our

56
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,160
magic oh nice very good and how can we

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,700
do that so I was very happy to see also

58
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,870
that we share the impression that

59
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,600
javascript is a powerful language it

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,380
it's very good for and very flexible and

61
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,410
it started being more and more powerful

62
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,280
the engines just show us that the

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,280
growing up and they don't have to be

64
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,200
jealous to other languages so this is a

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,890
short map of all we we imagined web

66
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,720
applications development of web

67
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,320
applications what do we need so we will

68
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,320
present to the server side where all we

69
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,080
worked on the server we will present you

70
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,770
although I will

71
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,140
the communication or we wanted to

72
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,250
enhance the communication level and oh

73
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,820
it can be binded to existing objects

74
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,200
frameworks and always the the way we see

75
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,350
all this widget could be improved upon

76
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:38,000
query seems like that we I will also be

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,700
able to show you or give you a small

78
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,560
picture of some web tools we all need

79
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,380
some web tools we never used for your

80
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,490
bag or things like that and I'm sorry

81
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,710
but the wacondah studio I will just

82
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,580
expose what is being implementing inside

83
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,530
but I can show it to you so what do you

84
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,540
did we imagine for the back on the

85
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,380
studio we think about when you are

86
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,150
building an application the first thing

87
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,940
its conception you have to make the

88
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,930
construction of your business model so

89
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,540
how do you design it with different

90
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,790
administration and conception tools

91
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,000
after there is another layer which is an

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,160
improvement with code with things like

93
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,930
that and after the with deployment so up

94
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,240
to optimize you optimize your your

95
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,000
application with caching mini feeling

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,940
she sings a good so another point when

97
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,280
you build for web application you have a

98
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,090
server you need to administrate it and

99
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,620
it's not the same well yeah it's not the

100
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,660
same capacity we are asking to an

101
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,210
administrator or to a developer or to

102
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,380
business model maker so we wanted it to

103
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,230
me to be very simple with the basic

104
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,010
things anybody could require you can go

105
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,340
to throw the settings and fix advantage

106
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,620
see advantage settings if you need but

107
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,850
you have directly quick dashboard and a

108
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,470
Miss

109
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:28,810
oops then another thing we always about

110
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,480
it's about testing we must test our

111
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,870
application if we want it to if we don't

112
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,020
want to have performance issue or

113
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,330
security issue and if you we don't want

114
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,890
our we all fear the bed so you need

115
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,830
testing we used about it for JavaScript

116
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,500
for when developing functions we say

117
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,140
okay tdd test drive and development it's

118
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,520
good but sometimes we were a bit we are

119
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,320
some programs because we didn't detect

120
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,040
it where it came from or between server

121
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,160
client communication so we wanted to

122
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,780
provide an easy way to make

123
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,010
communication testing so this tool allow

124
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,080
you to allow you to create a test case

125
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,960
on the HTTP layer once you build your

126
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,630
task a to generate a JavaScript code you

127
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,460
can just customize with what you require

128
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,810
what you want to get what you n turn to

129
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,320
what you expect to receive and then you

130
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:43,390
have a test fit they begin so the scary

131
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:49,540
part you we find some debugging tool in

132
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,870
web development it sees your own server

133
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,650
side on client side we have Firebug okay

134
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,690
and between it's not an easy way to to

135
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,690
see welcome weather back come from this

136
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,290
was we make communication layer testing

137
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,770
tools so in the same spirit we made

138
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,140
debugging tools remotely so you can ask

139
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:21,040
and make a step-by-step execution on

140
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,860
server side form the client and the

141
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,440
other side should be available to we

142
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,320
looked about existing protocols we just

143
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,150
we started to make our own

144
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,060
protocol but after we looked for those

145
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,840
it's working it's not very end it very

146
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,960
very good looking but it's working so it

147
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,760
will be implementing in the studio and

148
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,460
we want to implement it also in the

149
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:52,210
Firebug console then web services web

150
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,490
services most people think immediately

151
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:00,250
to soap it's good because now we start

152
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,310
to add about West web services which is

153
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,040
I think very more powerful and more

154
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,540
adapted for also HTTP but sometimes it's

155
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,750
easy to think just I call the function

156
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,040
so an easy way and the simple

157
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,920
communication layer it's json-rpc it's a

158
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,660
bit like a similar pc but with a json

159
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,430
lightweight and the protocol is really

160
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,320
simple but how to make it simple for

161
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,510
generate these functions and to use

162
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:43,900
these functions so we just want to say I

163
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,050
created simple function with access to

164
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,470
the database or to anything and I want

165
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,240
it to be used correctly by the client

166
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,630
and easily to the clay so I can provide

167
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,090
different kind of a firm and formations

168
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:05,370
like GS doc and also i can give more

169
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,980
complicated information with json schema

170
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,210
it works too so this information will be

171
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,760
used by the server to control the

172
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,770
parameters it received before executing

173
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,270
the function and on the client side

174
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,300
first we will say ok I want functions

175
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,450
which ones where will I put my functions

176
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,090
we all know that it's not good to have

177
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,440
it in the global area

178
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,680
so I can specify some native space this

179
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,050
is just one way to say we are one

180
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,900
functions and which functions i want you

181
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,660
can specify it in a JSON configuration

182
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,880
file and you can specify directly in

183
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,720
jazz in Java scripts out but we found

184
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,090
that an easy way when you are developing

185
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,140
to say okay I would just test it and

186
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,090
when you are in for a prediction mod

187
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,470
also you can add and they read some

188
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,840
things like that and make some other

189
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,900
configurations like okay the beginning

190
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,920
God yes no and this is flick HTML

191
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,850
compliant then we just said I want it in

192
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,640
the custom admin named face and which

193
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,980
method i want i can use it directly it's

194
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,980
working no program i can use it

195
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,880
synchronously I synchronously specifying

196
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,570
understand I'm sure you you know how it

197
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,550
works hello dr. Donna tree and a this is

198
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,600
only form well the the methods I asked

199
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,980
before but what if in a specific case I

200
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,360
want to use the method I didn't declare

201
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,030
you can just call some on-the-fly method

202
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:08,730
on your own server on on other servers

203
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,810
squirrelfish yes we had to choose a

204
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,650
JavaScript engine and we really believe

205
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,040
this is one of the fastest if not the

206
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,500
fastest we just so we just look too

207
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,320
different possibilities why no wasn't

208
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,070
the more performance so I think this is

209
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,470
a good choice and we will be able to go

210
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,390
very far with that come on Jess yes if

211
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,370
we want to use server side JavaScript

212
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,140
and to make it really big matic we have

213
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,230
to to have a common interface with

214
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,649
different and giants and we

215
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,059
difference of assigned and presentations

216
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:57,059
so 40 is really following it very near

217
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,529
and we will make what we can do with the

218
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,470
time we have because we are a small team

219
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,529
to to make it the more adapted the more

220
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:13,949
conformant and to provide some knowledge

221
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:18,689
so one of my specificities it's the HTTP

222
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:24,199
so I made a big screen a big spreadsheet

223
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,439
comparing the different HTTP interfaces

224
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:31,679
on the different application of

225
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,889
server-side JavaScript so I hope this

226
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:38,550
will help to other the good way the best

227
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,470
way to endure the HTTP web prices and

228
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,230
something I very care about its HTTP as

229
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,499
a lot of thing to offer to us and most

230
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:53,089
of them are not really exploited so I

231
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:56,160
observe with a good Antipas we can be

232
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:03,870
better things so after one of the good

233
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,829
the the best capacities of the 40

234
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:12,149
company it's the database it's working

235
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:15,089
with the database since a long time it's

236
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:20,009
an improved data bus it's working in a I

237
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:24,329
think thousand applications so it's yes

238
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,809
64 violin even a Unicode audio would

239
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:32,459
attend from that and what about it this

240
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:36,529
is relational database you can be used

241
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:42,449
to make SQL request but if you are in

242
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:47,129
javascript javascript interpreter is on

243
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,290
the same level than the SQL interpreter

244
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,170
this is a very important part you don't

245
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,660
have to generate and we don't generate

246
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,689
SQL queries the javascript is

247
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,149
interpreted directly on the database

248
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:00,830
layer

249
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,370
so you can ask for tables cause the

250
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,660
employee regards you can get it but this

251
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,320
is just for administration if you want

252
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,910
to make the cut for your application you

253
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,670
will ask for the entity level on TT

254
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,180
model level so i don't know if you are

255
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,500
aware about auntie T models it's a bit a

256
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,780
business abstraction so you can have

257
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,860
direct access to automatically generated

258
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,260
and GT models on the existing tables

259
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,090
it's very undie to start and you can

260
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,150
extend it and make it more hierarchical

261
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:50,450
and more more business view yeah more

262
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,600
usable you don't have to care about

263
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,110
relations and XE things like that you

264
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,710
are on the business layer so or do we

265
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,320
use it the JavaScript as access to an

266
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,230
object logit logic excuse me so you can

267
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,330
call employees but this is not the same

268
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,890
this one I call an employee entity model

269
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,590
so this is really i attribute i am

270
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:26,420
working on native object so I as i said

271
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,270
we directly by need to the database we

272
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,660
don't have to care about requests we we

273
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,400
are directly working on the data so this

274
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,600
is just an example so i can specify some

275
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,160
filters i can drop the item i received i

276
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,860
can ask Oh get work location about this

277
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,770
employee object this employee as a

278
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,600
company attribute that you don't have to

279
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,670
make much work i could have written

280
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,380
directly that i don't have to make

281
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,430
functions for that but if you want so i

282
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,170
will have an address object with its

283
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,440
attributes it can be recursive that it's

284
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,330
not a problem wanting to

285
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:16,320
to understand its attributes are objects

286
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,470
like you are used in JavaScript so it

287
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,600
can be strings it can be integrals but

288
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,750
it can be author on TT models it's quite

289
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:31,020
the same for the for the engine so the

290
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,120
REST API as we said JavaScript interface

291
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,920
is on the same level than the SQL one

292
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,970
sits it's the same thing for the HTTP

293
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,890
level but we didn't bind HTTP directly

294
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,830
to the world a chevelle model well it

295
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,490
was not we didn't find it very

296
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,350
interesting so a good point about the

297
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,020
MTT model it's it makes it very easy to

298
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,490
consider your data as resources as we

299
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,780
need it for West service so you can get

300
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,180
it you can delete it we are working on

301
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,320
resources and it's your fleet sorry for

302
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,390
I have difficulties to say this well

303
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,440
yeah Hika so you can you could have done

304
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,740
it on a employee name and and go on so I

305
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,410
will try it I will try to show you

306
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,780
two-bit in life so this is a JSON view

307
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,360
of what returns the server so if i go on

308
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,910
my browser i just will refresh it to eat

309
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,450
live ok it this is the catalog so I see

310
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,090
all the available quantity models you

311
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,150
can see some avid little Dora before

312
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,180
this is automatically generated on TT

313
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,470
models on the existing tables the other

314
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,040
ones as the extended entity models you

315
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,400
can just go through i'm using json view

316
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,440
extension for Firebug you can use it

317
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,190
very good I can check just the

318
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,440
description of the on TT model which

319
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,690
attribute it up what kind of type I have

320
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,880
some are more complicated than others

321
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,120
well I will take another example fight

322
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,480
employee yeah you can specify some

323
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,670
constraints because it's a business

324
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,530
logic and on the same way you have the

325
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:47,880
data you why so I will go to describe an

326
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,820
example this is combs it's some

327
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,760
companies I have an entity set of

328
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,400
companies I just deployed one a good

329
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,910
luck if I Doser ok and you have a

330
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,690
location attribute which is in reality

331
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,390
they failed I its by need to cities and

332
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,490
cities is another entity model I could

333
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,640
have asked it to 12 it directly in the

334
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,230
response and I didn't done it forum for

335
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,350
location but I did it for staff as you

336
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,950
can see the you were avail I said expand

337
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,720
staff ok expand staff all the stuff is

338
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,630
in my response I don't have to generate

339
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,610
another request this is kind of what you

340
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:44,630
need if you do you need to have very

341
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,150
precise information or do you need to

342
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,250
have all in one request when we are

343
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,620
talking about optimization we know that

344
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,970
sometime request at the cost so you just

345
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,040
have to look what anti fast you are

346
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,050
building and what information you will

347
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:07,490
need do benchmark then another example

348
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,160
ok just to say we provide this

349
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,420
information in JSON but some clients are

350
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:21,330
best will use it with very easily just

351
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,750
in XML but not very easily with JSON so

352
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,870
you can access the same informations or

353
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,540
you can access it or you will be able to

354
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,340
access it in an interactive HTML view

355
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,120
so this is an example I will just make a

356
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,380
refresh so you can see what's going on

357
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:50,350
okay refresh so you see the client is

358
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,909
asking for the catalog which will

359
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:55,059
describe the model of the UN the entity

360
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:59,830
will will work on after is looking for

361
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:05,500
the top 41 the 41st ones so I see the

362
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,320
just 12 okay but I cannot for and what's

363
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,260
going on there is new request then can

364
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,320
be generated and you can see I'm working

365
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,510
on a million of entities so this is easy

366
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,730
to navigate you don't like to say okay

367
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,549
next next act this is kind of

368
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:30,460
administration view because you you

369
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,500
didn't say okay you want that here I

370
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,570
want that no this is a direct view

371
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,059
interactive view of your data you call

372
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:41,110
you should you should limit access you

373
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,710
pull your administrator okay then if I

374
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,350
want some information I said this is

375
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,809
yucky ah sorry father damn it I said you

376
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,250
can access to all these tributes and

377
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,470
this is recursive so I just I for the

378
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:07,310
information

379
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,250
okay I would just a very touch screen so

380
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:17,710
we will drop that okay and so if I

381
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,450
require for the information it's loading

382
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,840
the staff who are spending even if there

383
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,600
is a lot of entities the the data

384
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,650
provider is filtering it say okay i will

385
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,260
send you in next pages if you need you

386
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,980
just have to ask me when you need it so

387
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,679
we wanted to give an abstraction about

388
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,610
the technical specificities the next

389
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,800
next next okay you don't have to care

390
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,450
you shouldn't have to care about that

391
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,020
you should have an exception layer so we

392
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,929
we put it on the data provider and the

393
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:59,620
data source is taking advantage about

394
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,970
that so that our solos also have context

395
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,030
so these two widgets because this is

396
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,970
widgets yeah that share the same data

397
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,880
source so you don't have to say I want

398
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,580
to bind this widget to this other widget

399
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,760
no they are binding to one data source

400
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,070
which has the same context that's all

401
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:30,550
the communication works then

402
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,410
so yes you can do SQL request if you

403
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,070
want we just say it's not a good idea

404
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,840
but if you have an administration hood

405
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,510
for an expert data does on the

406
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,830
relational layer you can give it give

407
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:52,590
him this access adapters because we want

408
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,650
a platform to be open we want to

409
00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:00,540
interact with other project and we we

410
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,300
don't want to make works that could be a

411
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,490
could have been done better about other

412
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,480
people okay so we will try to provide

413
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,650
your own widget if we sinks if we think

414
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:19,200
that we didn't find it all the way so we

415
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,620
have to communicate with a lot of people

416
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,400
so adapters must be easy to do so we

417
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,230
made it sums for extra GS jquery we made

418
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,900
some proof of concept for binding or

419
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,570
data provider with a jquery data grid

420
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,660
with a live scoring or salad and we're

421
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,340
working on an adapter for the Yui 3 dot

422
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,150
o the last version we also in talk with

423
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,120
will benefit ejects org and from the

424
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,290
cooks do guys so they run they are

425
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,120
interested in this project so we hope

426
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,080
that you could also be interpreted in it

427
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,640
and if you have some to some products as

428
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,940
I could communicate not only on the

429
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,760
client side ball also with server-side

430
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,950
we we are very open for it so this was

431
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,890
we try to make a quick picture of a lot

432
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,880
of functionalities a lot of things we

433
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,190
are working on so i hope the principal

434
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,470
was understood and you audit the the

435
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,470
specific disease of work under its the

436
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,520
fact we choose a very powerful

437
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,520
script service items I we wanted young I

438
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:52,200
talked about we noted before we wanted

439
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,620
to focus the development on the business

440
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,680
layer this is very important as I saw

441
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,710
the project working on this focus too

442
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,760
and one of the important thing is no SQL

443
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,790
generation you you shouldn't have to go

444
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,300
through SQL to get the data no this is a

445
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,560
way it can be a good way for for some

446
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,940
administration think so but for the

447
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,700
business view you should be able to

448
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,230
access on on the business layer directly

449
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,700
with the JavaScript Antipas and the same

450
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,860
for on the HTTP level so what do you

451
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,820
have to say more I think we are on the

452
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,340
end and we will have to ask your

453
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,260
feedbacks so unimportant things it's

454
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,210
still a project and there will be a

455
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,120
Developer Preview available at the

456
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,310
beginning of next year so just go and

457
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,100
check if you are interested we also on

458
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,480
Twitter and I hope this was interesting

459
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:16,280
I've used some questions yes

460
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,740
of oh do it

461
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,110
concurrency

462
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,000
so well the president which is a very

463
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,120
good developer and image that arise so

464
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,800
it was very easy to to bind the

465
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,070
JavaScript engine on the data bus so and

466
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,920
I is the one who made all those on TT

467
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,030
model layer I don't know if I understood

468
00:28:51,030 --> 00:29:02,969
watch the question yes

469
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:12,130
women's accessing NASA

470
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:17,160
right we will really cared about this

471
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,010
abstraction of the technical way so

472
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,039
normally on the JavaScript side you

473
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:32,040
don't have to care about it

474
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:36,210
good question yes this is a proprietary

475
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:41,740
server the we have on HTTP server but we

476
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,900
looking for interaction with other

477
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,830
servers to so about also a database

478
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,710
servers about also HTTP servers but

479
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,980
because this is really optimized we will

480
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,930
be we should be able yes to communicate

481
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,210
with others but you won't have this

482
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,970
optimization so we will try to make it

483
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,030
the best we can but it will be difficult

484
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,180
to as the same direction because of the

485
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:17,360
SQL or things like

486
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:32,999
yes

487
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:38,450
so I'm styria if you want I can make one

488
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,230
to one de Mo's or things like that and

489
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,899
answer to other Christians you have a

490
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:46,700
jean michel we can also answer to

491
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,549
questions about the marketing questions

492
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:57,009
about even what you could think about

493
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:02,530
thank you thank you
