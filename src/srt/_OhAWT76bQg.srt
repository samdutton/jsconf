1
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,869

commands Nathan time I'm a technical

2
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,230
evangelist at Microsoft I work on

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,380
Windows Azure so probably a lot of stuff

4
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,910
that most of you have never heard of I

5
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,129
see a lot of max in the room that's all

6
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:34,379
right I've back to so today I'm going to

7
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:37,620
talk about cloud and node copters in the

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,320
cloud so I actually just got here today

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,239
unfortunately this is a super busy time

10
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,220
of the year for me so I wasn't able to

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,269
attend the full conference my

12
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:46,769
understanding is you guys saw a bunch of

13
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,650
robots drones things like that like 52

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,720
node copters so we're not going to go

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,729
over that again I know you've all seen

16
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,110
that but what we're going to do is talk

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,690
about how we can do some some crazy

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,140
stuff with these node copters with the

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,000
AR drones connecting through the cloud

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,750
so I want to preface this this demo is

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,490
like super crazy hardware wise I brought

22
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,760
my own router I have this so they like

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,350
there's two possibilities of this it's

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,790
either going to be awesome and we're all

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,500
gonna have fun or nothing's going to

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,299
work and i'm just going to sob up here

27
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,630
so hopefully that doesn't happen so uh

28
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,740
huh anyway so again talking quickly so i

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,600
kind of already did the intro why are we

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,310
doing this all right so actually quick

31
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,600
really quick what we're going to show

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,030
i'm going to do mostly code um so what

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,590
I'm going to show here what scenario i'm

34
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,119
going to show is basically we're going

35
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,729
to build a local app both running on my

36
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,249
on my mac here but a local app that's

37
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:43,740
receiving messages from the cloud and

38
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,939
i'll explain a little bit more how we're

39
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,880
going to do that in a bit and then we're

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,579
going to build a controller app that's

41
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,560
going to send messages so the idea is we

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,020
could be remote and actually fly this on

43
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,600
node copter and we're going to use a

44
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,130
queuing service in the cloud in windows

45
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,109
azure to actually communicate between

46
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:03,240
the two of these so why are we doing

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,509
this well there's a couple reasons the

48
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,210
first one I really wanted to use my

49
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,800
corporate expense account to buy one of

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,569
these things so I had to think of a

51
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,750
reason to do so ha the second reason i

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,730
thought what would be a fun what would

53
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,600
be a really fun way to to really just

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,319
scare the crap out of my girlfriend and

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,420
I thought if I just had this node copter

56
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,580
sitting in the living room and flew this

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,120
thing you know while I'm gone

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,190
that would that would be really fun for

59
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,629
me and probably get me in a lot of

60
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,730
trouble also pets it's super good on

61
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,470
pets so this is basically what we're

62
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,120
going to build here oh we're going to

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,260
we're going to build a local app

64
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,209
controlling our through the cloud

65
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,090
controlling our helicopter for the

66
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,420
amusement of the of the evildoer to

67
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,709
scare the pets and the clip art folks in

68
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,349
that in that microsoft legal approved

69
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:00,049
photo i'm allowed to use so a really

70
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,390
quick little bit a sales pitch here so I

71
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,420
do i do of course work for Microsoft

72
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,470
they only pay me if I tell you what I do

73
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,549
so again we're going to use Windows

74
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:12,260
Azure I'm going to make this 15 seconds

75
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,310
really quick we're going to skip the

76
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,379
marketing crap we're going to talk about

77
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:16,549
Windows edgers how many people here have

78
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:19,819
actually heard of Windows Azure that is

79
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,500
shocking okay how many people have used

80
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,739
it oh cool so the only thing I'm really

81
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,870
going to say about Windows Azure is we

82
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,150
are home i still have there we go we

83
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,609
we've really done a lot offer no Jess we

84
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:33,049
love no Jess so it's not all about

85
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,000
Microsoft right it's not all about net

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,010
net certainly works super well if you do

87
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,620
that I assume no one in here does odd

88
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,030
again judging by the sea of max there's

89
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,470
a guy there's a guy with an HP there

90
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,230
don't be embarrassed yeah I left mine in

91
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,200
my hotel so I thought I'd get lynched ah

92
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,930
no but yeah so basically we we've put a

93
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,389
lot of effort into I into basically

94
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:55,099
making nodejs work really well on

95
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,989
Windows Azure we actually have a number

96
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:58,519
of customers building very large

97
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,590
applications using a number of our

98
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,810
services on no Jess running in Windows

99
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,000
Azure as I'll show today we have a whole

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
CLI tools and and a whole SDK that works

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,980
entirely on Mac i'm not using windows so

102
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,480
we are definitely not even though it's

103
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,549
set in DOS it's all about open source

104
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,430
nodejs and and other things so i would

105
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,720
definitely encourage you to try it out

106
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,030
there's a lot of like free if we've got

107
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,739
all these free programs like we like to

108
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,479
give things away for free but there's

109
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:24,860
like a ton of stuff we give away for

110
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,620
free for Windows Azure like search for

111
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,150
biz spark or any number of things but

112
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,199
there's like a whole bunch of ways to

113
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,729
get a lot of free Windows Azure so

114
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,139
that's the only sales pitch I'll do I

115
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,020
apologize for that again I only get paid

116
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,710
if I if I say that so Windows Azure com

117
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,870
I'm actually really happy that that most

118
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,230
of you have heard about it

119
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,200
Zara or I guess I'm doing a good job so

120
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,730
offer the rest of the demo we're just

121
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,990
going to coat so this is the part that's

122
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,030
either going to leave me weeping in

123
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,580
tears or everyone everyone clapping and

124
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,500
cheering in my head fantasy so everyone

125
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,930
seems very tired here I've had like

126
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,700
three redbulls this morning I and

127
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,050
there's free Red Bulls out there why

128
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,280
haven't you guys been chugging these

129
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,800
things anytime I'm given free redbull I

130
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,740
drink a lot of them it's very dangerous

131
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,570
so I know like some some of you may work

132
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,850
at Facebook I know they're there they're

133
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,160
red bulls there all the time and and I

134
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,660
think I would die if I work there we

135
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,750
only get free soda which which makes it

136
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,340
harder to ingest large quantities of

137
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,940
caffeine so let's zoom in on this a

138
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,340
little bit tell me if you can't see it

139
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,320
so what I'm going to show again is we're

140
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,810
going to really quickly in 18 minutes

141
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,360
hopefully build an app that we can use

142
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,970
windows azure to basic communicate from

143
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,410
the client to the cloud and make this

144
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,370
thing fly and probably crash so let's

145
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,950
give it a go so I have an express jess

146
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,170
app basically already set up we ought we

147
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,460
probably all know how to do that I don't

148
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,860
want to explain that um we don't have

149
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,960
time to explain that so I've got a basic

150
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,940
Express jess app I've got a few modules

151
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,220
installed the ar.drone module windows

152
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,320
azure and then Jade and all that crap so

153
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,320
ah so let's do let's build our server

154
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,060
side app first so this is again just a

155
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,890
raw raw Express app so I'm going to

156
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,050
build and sorry actually let's do our

157
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,250
client site at first that makes more

158
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,780
sense so what I'm going to do is build a

159
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,940
client-side application that receives

160
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,160
messages I'm supposed to gesture to this

161
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,160
monitor that receives messages from the

162
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,470
cloud and tells our drone to fly to land

163
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,790
that's all I meant actually do because

164
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,250
otherwise i know i will crash it so fly

165
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,020
and land we've all seen the other things

166
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,330
it can do i yes yesterday and then we're

167
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,740
also if we have time we're going to do

168
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,020
some stuff with some logging data we of

169
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,910
course could do a lot more take photos

170
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,850
stream video all of the fun things but

171
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,370
but I think we're pretty short on time

172
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,170
we want to have time to show that so um

173
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,570
so I'm not actually gonna code in front

174
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,850
you but I do have some I've cheated

175
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,530
given the lack of time so the first

176
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,450
thing I want to do is I just use our

177
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,490
windows azure sdk to

178
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,729
you to actually read our sorry we're

179
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:02,009
starting with the client new file skip

180
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,190
the step here so actually hang on i'm

181
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,780
going to i'm going to go even faster i'm

182
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,349
going to cheat even more apologize since

183
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,840
we're running short on time alright so

184
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,830
let's copy some code and client j/s save

185
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,080
that so we're basically we've we've

186
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,160
imported drone module and and i have my

187
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,949
drone set on this IP address on my own

188
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,319
custom access point here so there's a

189
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,090
few things I'm going to do the first

190
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,599
thing is I want to actually I want to

191
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,680
actually receive some messages from the

192
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,810
service plus we'll send these messages

193
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,610
in a second but service bus is basically

194
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,440
a very simple queuing service in Windows

195
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,789
Azure so we're going to connect up to

196
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,020
this and we're just going to continually

197
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,240
pull our windows as your service bus for

198
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,370
cues I excuse my code this is really

199
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,389
awful but this is this is just for demo

200
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:56,849
so that's why it's not very robust but

201
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,409
hopefully you'll forgive me let me

202
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,690
assume in on that and let me know if I'm

203
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,550
talking too fast again I have had three

204
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,630
redbulls I have a lot to get through in

205
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,960
a very short period of time so so yeah

206
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,490
so this is our code here what we're

207
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,199
doing is again we're we're we're using

208
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,440
the nodejs SDK for Windows Azure we're

209
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,969
we're creating a service bus queue

210
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:18,960
client and then we're going to

211
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,419
continually read from from the queue and

212
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,060
actually let's just set interval and

213
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,300
we'll do receive oops a receive message

214
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,800
I can't spell an everton spell on the

215
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,709
stage that's why you snippets all right

216
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:41,250
receive message and let's just do it so

217
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,599
what we're going to do is just set a set

218
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,550
a set an interval here and we're going

219
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,980
to call our service bus every second and

220
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,290
check for a message and then we're going

221
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,820
to we're going to issue command so we

222
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,670
need a few commands to actually to

223
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,339
actually control our drone and these are

224
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,290
things you guys have already seen before

225
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,260
I think client so let's just do this

226
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,000
really quick commands so we've got a

227
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,060
couple commands here for takeoff and in

228
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,030
land so let's actually clips

229
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:14,940
I ain't a take-off no wait was it yeah

230
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,400
take off so i called the take-off so

231
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,950
client take off and client I don't know

232
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,010
why didn't fill those client land oops

233
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,330
again can't spell on stage land so to

234
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,360
recap this is our simple client and this

235
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,980
will be running on our local machine I

236
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,510
thought about actually running this on a

237
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,800
separate computer but there's the issue

238
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,060
of two monitors i also thought like I

239
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,890
could run this on my surface on Windows

240
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,420
to show that node works you know that we

241
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,070
could use both and then like to make it

242
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,300
even more portable like I could

243
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,490
duct-tape my surface to the drone but

244
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,900
then I discovered that it wouldn't fly

245
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,870
if it had a computer tough you guys

246
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,580
don't like my humor con are you guys

247
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,470
asleep was everyone out drinking last

248
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,950
night what's going on wake up I'm gonna

249
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,810
be I'm gonna get louder unless people

250
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,130
start laughing I can't handle it alright

251
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,770
so I'm trying to let's have fun I want

252
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,350
to have fun all right ah so I know I

253
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,970
know that most of the sessions here are

254
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,500
about learning something useful again

255
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,090
I'm going to repeat this is only about

256
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,120
doing something completely ridiculous

257
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,590
and kind of having some fun with it so

258
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,420
let's try to have a little bit of fun so

259
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,580
we've got our service bus receiver we're

260
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,530
going to continually pull for messages

261
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,420
obviously these messages could be more

262
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,880
sophisticated I just have a string take

263
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,980
off land wrote we're not going to do

264
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,360
rotate because I've had troubles with

265
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,620
that in the past and then we do all

266
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,180
kinds of crazy things then the things

267
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,860
flying across the room and then someone

268
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,380
gets hurt you know Microsoft is lawsuit

269
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,570
all kinds of stuff I get fired so so

270
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,040
we're going to just do take off and land

271
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,020
up and down as safe but we could of

272
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,670
course do more sophisticated things pass

273
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,100
more data altitude things like that so

274
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,200
this is our client I and we're going to

275
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,430
run that we're going to run this here in

276
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,400
just a second but let's build our server

277
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,000
so a couple code snippets here for

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,510
brevity so server service for us so

279
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,680
we're going to again connect to that

280
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,230
same service bus I using our as your SDK

281
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,530
service bus queue and and we're going to

282
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,880
we're going to have we give the send

283
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,530
command function here and then I'm just

284
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,300
going to add a few routes we're going to

285
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,190
do this again really terribly with just

286
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,420
some get requests routes so we've got

287
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,710
we've got our

288
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,660
take off route and we'll just redirect

289
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,360
back to home and our land gets and then

290
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,230
let's just add some very fancy you I I'm

291
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,430
for those who have seen me speak before

292
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,190
probably none of you you will know that

293
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,790
I'm world renowned for my great user

294
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,390
interface abilities there we go and

295
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,980
that's that you see someone's impressed

296
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,370
alright so so let's just make sure we

297
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,050
got everything so we have our client

298
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,400
we've got our point we've got our server

299
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,030
here running express couple simple

300
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,890
functions sending some messages to the

301
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,740
queue command take off and land and then

302
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,180
we've got our client which would be

303
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,310
running locally receiving messages from

304
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,650
the queue and if all goes according to

305
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,320
plan we'll be able to do some fun stuff

306
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,440
so let's first let's run our server if I

307
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:26,610
can type OS my I'm just happening there

308
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,060
we go after Jess all right we got that

309
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,420
running and client j/s so again well

310
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:43,080
look rookie mistake you guys can shout

311
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,230
at me but if you see something like you

312
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,410
missed a semicolon or noob all right

313
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,570
yeah this alright so we've got our we've

314
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,300
got our client j/s again remember even

315
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,650
though these are running on one machine

316
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,440
these in in practice when i'm harassing

317
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,430
friends relatives family pets would be

318
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,200
running on two separate machines and I

319
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,620
would be sitting somewhere remote

320
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,890
alright so let's go to our let's go to

321
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,230
our unnamed browser here there I get

322
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,000
that they don't have internet explorer

323
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,440
on a mac work for Microsoft so I'm not

324
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,680
allowed to say the name I'm just kidding

325
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,110
I'm not really that would be I just get

326
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,730
like a mount I get a hundred dollars

327
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,610
deducted from my paycheck so that's fine

328
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,120
haha so we've got our very fancy app up

329
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,040
here with our takeoff and our land

330
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,720
command now hopefully this is still

331
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,940
connected and let's let's go ahead and

332
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,380
click takeoff and this is going to

333
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:57,149
encule message what do we do uh-oh see

334
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:58,670
there we go we got to save things

335
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:04,889
obviously all right now let's try that

336
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:12,959
again take off yes and it takes off and

337
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,600
then we're it worked so happy and and

338
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,510
we'll land and again that's all we're

339
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,529
going to do I know there's a lot more

340
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,620
fun we can do but it will it will fly

341
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,769
around the room and it will crash and

342
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,720
bad things will happen so that's really

343
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,339
that's really the main the main thing I

344
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,170
want to show so this this to me like

345
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,060
even though again it's it's ha it's

346
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,610
pretty much useless but I think it's a

347
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,079
lot of fun and really like you can

348
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,519
imagine a lot of scenarios where

349
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,600
something like this would be useful

350
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,790
obviously there's the there's like a

351
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,550
bunch of industrial scenarios or remote

352
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,160
sensors remote devices that you could

353
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,010
actually build an app like this pushing

354
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,560
messages from any network through a

355
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,269
service like windows as your service bus

356
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,880
queues and receiving that locally um so

357
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,230
the last thing I want how much time do

358
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,870
we have we have we have enough time so

359
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,880
the next thing I want to show you is so

360
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,680
we basically sent data using the cloud

361
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,240
now I want to use another another

362
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,860
service in windows as this is a simple

363
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,769
storage service and actually save some

364
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,709
data up there so let's so the next thing

365
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,029
we're just going to take some of the

366
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:23,519
telemetry data there's for those who

367
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,790
have done note our programming before it

368
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,769
sends back basically telemetry data like

369
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,839
its current altitude various rotation

370
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,699
data things like that um so what I want

371
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,199
to do is actually just read that data

372
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,209
from the node copter and actually save

373
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:39,480
that up into windows azure so let's

374
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,279
let's go back to this we'll do on our

375
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,949
client application so let's go ahead and

376
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:45,899
just add some more code i already have

377
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:54,569
prepared here drone blob so for this i'm

378
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:57,329
going to use our Windows Azure blob

379
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:59,249
storage which is which is basically just

380
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,279
a binary service or storing any any

381
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,920
binary data we also have serve it we

382
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,019
also have some like table service for

383
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,120
storing a schema lyst tabular data we of

384
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,399
course have like sequel in the cloud my

385
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,170
sequel various things like that if you

386
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,459
want to if you want to use something

387
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:15,959
that's equal we have through hosting

388
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,110
providers we have of course mongodb

389
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,519
things like that but this we're just

390
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,379
going to basically store Jason text

391
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:25,259
object into our blob storage just for

392
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:29,129
simplicity so we've got so again this is

393
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,720
our our save function connect to Windows

394
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,939
Azure blob storage and then create a

395
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:35,430
blob and save that too let's create a

396
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,430
new blob just so we have an empty one to

397
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,470
prove that it is working so let's go

398
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,120
back to so I'm just going to go to my

399
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,740
azure portal here and storage and cloud

400
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,629
drone and let's just make a new

401
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:50,069
container I already got some logging

402
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,959
data in there but so we have a fresh one

403
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,790
let's call this log three and we'll make

404
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,620
a public container so everyone can see

405
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,230
all our fancy logging data log 3 that's

406
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,539
alright and let's just change that to

407
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:09,089
log 3 so what we're going to do again on

408
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,679
the client we're going to receive data

409
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,480
from from RR copter as its flying and

410
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,240
we're going to just save it back up to

411
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,839
went to the Windows Azure blob so we can

412
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,270
look at it that's really that's all we

413
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,329
have just look at it so let's uh oh and

414
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,350
we need to we need to fire an event

415
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,669
client on nav data so this is the the

416
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:39,419
the the ar.drone SDK is firing on nav

417
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,330
data and

418
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:50,009
save data so if you notice I'm doing

419
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:51,720
kind of something silly here I'm only

420
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,220
going to save it like an arbitrarily

421
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,450
every every millisecond that's divisible

422
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,970
by 100 just because basically this event

423
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,860
gets fired like like I don't I don't

424
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,600
know it's like forever but it gets fired

425
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,090
constantly so like we end up with a lot

426
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,220
of data so I'm just kind of like

427
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,499
limiting that to an arbitrary

428
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,570
arbitrarily smaller amount of data so

429
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,429
this is our this is all we need to do to

430
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:16,590
now capture data from our drone and save

431
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,330
it up into blob storage so let's go

432
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,600
ahead and and stop our clients here our

433
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,980
client and run that again and now we are

434
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,350
going to be capturing nav data so let's

435
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,980
let's let's launch this again and it's

436
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,970
still working awesome and now let's go

437
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,169
leave it running so we see we're going

438
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:44,220
to save some log data and we'll land it

439
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:52,200
now awesome so let's exciting the second

440
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,309
time and now we should see that in in in

441
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:59,879
our in our portal here we have we have

442
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,889
got some data so let's go ahead and copy

443
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:03,600
the URL since we made this public we can

444
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,059
just browse this and there we go we've

445
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,850
got all our log saved so so pretty

446
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,899
simple we have a few more minutes left

447
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:14,759
so now so what I want to do I think we

448
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,830
have time now I want to actually deploy

449
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,429
this application up into this is the web

450
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,710
app up into windows azure so on this is

451
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,149
the part that gets very dangerous so

452
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:26,580
that you guys can decide when it flaw

453
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,419
when it when it takes off and lands so

454
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,730
for nodejs we have we have a service

455
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,100
called windows as your websites which is

456
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,519
basically a super easy way to to deploy

457
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,529
applications into the cloud so let's

458
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:41,850
just go ahead and create a windows as

459
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,789
your website and let's just call this

460
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:48,929
j/s com it's not taken cool beans so

461
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:50,549
let's choose our region east us and

462
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,559
create Jas comp so with windows as your

463
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,730
websites is a variety of different

464
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,490
deployment options but the the one that

465
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,230
makes most sense for no developers as we

466
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,580
can deploy right up to Windows Azure

467
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,120
websites with get so so let's so our

468
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,640
sites created and let's go ahead and

469
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,390
select this and go to our dashboard oops

470
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,920
go back and a set of deployment so we

471
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,840
can do a couple of different things we

472
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,460
can actually deploy with continuous

473
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,830
integration from github or from you from

474
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,230
dropbox and from like bitbucket whatever

475
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,750
or we can just push directly to a to a

476
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,360
local to a local get or to a good end

477
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,040
point just in our in our deployment

478
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,470
servers so we'll take just a second to

479
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,540
create that get endpoint and then allah

480
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,210
then I'll initialize I'll set this up

481
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:51,240
and while this is and here's our here's

482
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,490
our get server so let's just let's just

483
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,550
quickly push this up into windows azure

484
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,950
so i'm going to nish Eliza's a git repo

485
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,679
again just a regular git repo remote as

486
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:09,760
europe's add a sure

487
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,620
and I didn't put it ignore so we're

488
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,940
going to push the node modules we don't

489
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,600
actually med sorry we don't actually

490
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,100
have to push up the modules of course

491
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,830
those will be installed the first time

492
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,050
those will be installed from packages

493
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,720
but i forgot to create a pack and ignore

494
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,670
to get ignore file so we're just going

495
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,650
to push those up anyway which is fine

496
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,580
get push as your master although it'll

497
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,020
take a little longer so we'll make it

498
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:44,090
quite a cool so again we're just pushing

499
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:51,470
this this website up to up to up to

500
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,220
windows as your websites port good so

501
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,380
we're just pushing this up with get to

502
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,200
windows azure websites to a website that

503
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,330
will be at j s comped as your websites

504
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,300
net and I should not have committed the

505
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,550
modules because they're huge compared to

506
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,350
the site but that's alright so normally

507
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,300
you would obviously ignore the modules

508
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,920
and not commit that into your git repo

509
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,750
eyes would be best practice and windows

510
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,040
as your websites will pull those and

511
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,440
install those when you when you push the

512
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,500
site so making it much faster so we'll

513
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,840
see here our deployment happens and this

514
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:30,920
just takes a few seconds few seconds

515
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,750
longer Joey's takes longer when you're

516
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,480
demoing right entra have any questions

517
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,520
while we're waiting oh there we go no

518
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:47,589
questions all right

519
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:54,589
j/s comp dot as your websites dotnet so

520
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,690
yeah good question so do native modules

521
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,059
work so yes so windows as your websites

522
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,969
is running on Windows we are Microsoft

523
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:06,259
after all so we do support running Linux

524
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,849
in Windows Azure through virtual

525
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:10,539
machines our websites which is basic

526
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,709
higher-level purely managed hosting

527
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:15,320
environment does run windows so

528
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,269
basically any module I mean most nade

529
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:19,459
module and most native modules at this

530
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:21,499
point do run I mean do work on windows

531
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:23,299
there certainly a number that don't

532
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:25,429
though if they don't build on windows

533
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:26,899
they're not going to work on Windows

534
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:28,699
Azure websites we're working we're

535
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,709
working we want to fix that like wow my

536
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,739
god i forgot that i forgot that this oh

537
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:36,919
man see this is why i only made it take

538
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:39,259
off and landing otherwise like you guys

539
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:40,549
would be flying around the room and

540
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:41,929
there would be a lawsuit and it would be

541
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:43,369
it would be bad i would definitely get

542
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:46,579
fired so cool yes so this is this is my

543
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:48,889
demo hopefully this this this was fun

544
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:51,529
and now hopefully some of you I'm not

545
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,149
actually recommending this but hopefully

546
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:55,209
you can use it for some sort of

547
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:57,469
entertaining purposes scaring friends

548
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,409
and family and pets not pet so that is a

549
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:01,999
joke that actually mean I wouldn't do

550
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:04,399
that but friends and family of course so

551
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:07,609
yes so so yeah so back to the the node

552
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,319
modules quote yes so we're working on it

553
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,299
I don't know what the solution will be

554
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:12,559
whether we have build servers that are

555
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,569
Linux whether we eventually have like

556
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:17,359
Linux servers for for node but yeah

557
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,309
there is the limitation with that right

558
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:22,249
now cool and you guys are fighting over

559
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:26,029
it now I like it all right so all right

560
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:28,759
we're just out of time so hopefully that

561
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,619
was somewhat enjoyable and maybe a

562
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:32,839
little useful but like I said they're so

563
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,849
for off for Windows Azure if you are a

564
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,139
start-up or if you're building something

565
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,819
and you want free hosting just go to

566
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:39,649
microsoft com whack business park we've

567
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:40,940
got this program that basically we're

568
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,319
going to give you like it's like six

569
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,729
thousand dollars a year of free Windows

570
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:46,039
Azure to host your stuff on so a

571
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,049
shameless plug but you get a lot of free
