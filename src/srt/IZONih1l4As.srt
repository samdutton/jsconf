00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,210

hi I'm Tracy I'm a web engineer at urban

2
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,220
airship by day I'm also a conference

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,009
organizer and self-confessed sugar fiend

4
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:26,470
I've worn many hats and one of them

5
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,929
being a baker also the conference

6
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,640
organizer an addictions program

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,900
coordinator and a restaurant manager

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,820
that is not an exhaustive list so

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
because I love making whether it's via

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,150
code or cookies I long considered

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,820
culinary schools means to fulfillment so

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,579
I know da nerd out on cooking and baking

13
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,280
and recipes as much as I like to nerd

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,710
out on JavaScript and learning things

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,629
very quickly and kind of taking notes on

16
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:59,890
what I need to keep up on so in one of

17
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,420
my younger fits of courage I was

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,449
determined to run my own bakery and the

19
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:06,940
idea of being able to take recipes I'd

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,280
crafted to perfection over many years

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,710
and build a successful business was

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,830
intoxicating in hindsight I could chalk

23
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,369
this up to maybe being on a fairly

24
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:25,660
pervasive sugar high yeah so I've got

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,340
this huge collection of recipes at this

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,500
point and this this is something that I

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,880
thought was absolutely beautiful this is

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,880
a collection of recipes from a pillsbury

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,030
used to be able to mail in for I believe

30
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,030
it was a dollar that was back in the 50s

31
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,179
and it's kind of incredible that you've

32
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:46,869
got this this book that when you plow

33
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:48,520
through it you can find these in vintage

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,369
shops and flea markets they've got this

35
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,890
you know handwritten notes all along the

36
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,789
way and this is you know it's a

37
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,489
beautiful way to collect collect recipes

38
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,860
and collect memories but it's terrible

39
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,209
if you want to be able to search for it

40
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,899
down the road if you lose a page if you

41
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,140
spill something on it so that's that's

42
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,510
kind of where I got started with this so

43
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,610
on any given night when I get finished

44
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,680
working I'm starving because I'm pretty

45
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,349
obsessed with food all the time and I'll

46
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,840
throw up in my laptop and search

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,580
what I've got in the house and that's

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,430
just to minimize me running to the store

49
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,280
so I'm craving a flavor not necessarily

50
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,980
a cuisine you know how does how does

51
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,810
recipe search address this every time I

52
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,910
would Google something one of my

53
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,370
favorite recipe search sites all recipes

54
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,440
it's sort of like they're giving me this

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,989
huge amount of information back and I

56
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,790
don't want to have to plow through all

57
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,769
these recipes that have way too many

58
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,959
ingredients that I just don't care what

59
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,450
I have to go by so you know how do we

60
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,420
combine curation of good recipe content

61
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,079
with better search to avoid having to do

62
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,130
something like build a recommendation

63
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,049
engine because I'm lazy and I don't want

64
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,230
to see a thousand results so again once

65
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,120
you know in my prior life I was a baker

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,030
and I i love researching recipes i love

67
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,030
modifying them and I delight in the Y as

68
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,370
much as the how following the methods

69
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,230
repeating experiments seeing what I've

70
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,959
done wrong my methodology for making

71
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,450
something new begins with recipe

72
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,030
compilation in paper and digital formats

73
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,670
I read the comments lots and lots of

74
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,319
them this is one of the few times I

75
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,880
think it's a very unhappy and I find I

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,709
kind of find where cultural habits have

77
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,260
crept in I try and hone in on the recipe

78
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,090
for what I believe to be the most honest

79
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,450
to history and honest to my experiences

80
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,250
with baking and cooking already and then

81
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,819
I run with it so to do this where do you

82
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,790
go books and magazine articles I've

83
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,910
hoarded over the years but this this

84
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,400
ended up in very recent years becoming a

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,859
sort of obsolete method for me I've

86
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,160
moved quite a bit and in that I've

87
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,130
downsized and even prioritizing my

88
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,790
recipe books you can only box full of

89
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,829
professional culinary books around have

90
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,660
a few flight of stairs so many times

91
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,310
before you realize like you just need to

92
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,220
digitize things and you know the other

93
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,229
method that I use now more than ever is

94
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,680
the internet so recipe search and that's

95
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,900
where we're at it turns out search is

96
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,820
done pretty well by this this place

97
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,139
called Google

98
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,439
and I have my favorite sources and most

99
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,569
of them have been revealed by that its

100
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:45,779
food bloggers who can be trusted to have

101
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:48,029
sort of my style of cooking they test

102
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,129
recipes out they make comments about it

103
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,169
they modify it they might even do a

104
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:54,210
follow-up a year later on a project that

105
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,389
they'd already done and they accept

106
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,370
feedback for improvement which is

107
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,400
incredible those ones tend to be the

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,039
best recipes for me but you know again

109
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,860
how you find them Google and that's not

110
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,650
easy for discovery purposes you know I

111
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,270
can make arguments about curated web

112
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,939
with blog posts and writing verses

113
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,800
something like social web which is what

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,979
i consider all recipes it's a super

115
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,110
interesting rabbit hole that i would

116
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,050
love to do another project on but not

117
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,449
yet so from a Content perspective what's

118
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,089
the current state of recipe search there

119
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:36,900
are tons of recipe api's most of them

120
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,909
are paid and they provide really an

121
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,529
insane amount of recipes but the idea is

122
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:46,050
that you're wanting to provide that

123
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,240
information to something a project that

124
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,339
you're already building and I guess

125
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:51,810
they're assuming that you're not going

126
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,250
to be making that many requests because

127
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,819
the price really adds up quickly then

128
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,349
the question is like what do you do if

129
00:05:58,349 --> 00:05:59,969
the data that they're offering is is

130
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:01,500
limited or they're not offering

131
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,379
something that you find really

132
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,139
interesting and you want to include I

133
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,839
wanted a cross-reference reviews I

134
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,310
wanted ingredient lists types of food

135
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,189
timer preparation of cooking it's not

136
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:20,899
that I think of all of these resources

137
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,860
that have been provided to us even

138
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,330
something like all recipes which is I'm

139
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,610
really appreciative of and they've been

140
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,860
in existence for years I don't think

141
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,839
that they're broken it's that I want to

142
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,639
play with the idea of another way and I

143
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,839
wanted more i wanted to be able to

144
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,389
explore so again the bright side is I'm

145
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,430
not pooh-poohing all recipe is there an

146
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,310
incredible website and I believe that

147
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,019
they were the most robust for collection

148
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,529
and discovering it labels itself as a

149
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:50,760
food focused social

150
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,620
a website and I would say that that's

151
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,470
very on point what's been so interesting

152
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,060
about all recipes over the years is that

153
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,040
as they've added features and even

154
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,640
trying to clean up the UI the user added

155
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,140
comments has still remained the most

156
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,560
valuable piece of that website for me

157
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,530
and really across the internet it's it

158
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,510
helps me learn and helps me spot out

159
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,610
when there's issues in a recipe you know

160
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,080
you'll look at something in the comments

161
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,090
for instance we'll have something like

162
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,280
this recipe had way too much baking soda

163
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,740
in it or I prefer less salt and they

164
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,860
even have user ratings on how helpful

165
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,630
these comments have been in the past and

166
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,790
how helpful these users have been in the

167
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,070
past with giving good comments and um I

168
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,570
was sort of flabbergasted when i was

169
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,250
working through this project and how

170
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,810
valuable that could be and sort of like

171
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,180
how you can harness that you know it's

172
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,070
sort of like you've got I've got my mom

173
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,170
standing in the kitchen helping me and

174
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,920
telling me not to use that much salt and

175
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,060
you know blogs generally have lower

176
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,580
traffic most of the commenters are

177
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,130
appreciating the art of food photography

178
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,800
and maybe the the beautiful descriptive

179
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,900
writing but they haven't tested the

180
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,670
recipes so that's not really helpful and

181
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:10,140
it's frustrating so it might seem like a

182
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,850
silly question but what is a recipe when

183
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,020
it comes down to it like what are we

184
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,450
talking about when I'm talking about you

185
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,600
know working on what this means and they

186
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,580
can be you know essentially it's a

187
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,500
fairly standard formula of how to cook

188
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,230
or bake something that you want they can

189
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,760
be an experiment to try flavors you're

190
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,560
curious about they can be a family

191
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,900
legacy passed down and recreated from

192
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,599
generation generation the nights I

193
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,490
chased my mom around the kitchen asking

194
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,990
questions to understand what's going

195
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,050
where and why you know those the kind of

196
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,220
things that you end up writing in the

197
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,800
little corner notes there's a series

198
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,380
that I obsessed over for a little while

199
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,930
called mind of a chef and it features a

200
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,270
few chefs celebrating cooking and travel

201
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,700
history science all kind of wrapped up

202
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,340
into this rich study of past heritage

203
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,840
and the line it carries from the

204
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,640
delicious food that they prepare and

205
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,000
their world-class restaurants now chef

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,170
sean brock

207
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,690
of Charleston South Carolina and his

208
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,389
famed restaurant husk I was known for

209
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,399
his passion in sharing southern

210
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,680
preservation techniques as well as

211
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,050
elevating generations old graham and

212
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,029
heirloom seeds he used in his own

213
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,810
kitchen he's converted many a skeptic

214
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,880
into appreciating southern food for more

215
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,769
than its sweet tea and it's greats in

216
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:28,019
tracing the roots of the flavors he was

217
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,250
so familiar with he traveled to Senegal

218
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,110
to explore the West African influences

219
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,750
on Southern cuisine there's a point

220
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,070
where he starts to notice this

221
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,399
remarkable familiarity in flavors and

222
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,310
techniques such as gumbo broths and rice

223
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,300
dishes despite the vast geographical

224
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,430
differences in availability of similar

225
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:57,510
raw ingredients so you know like where

226
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,610
am I going with this you've got these

227
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,699
beautiful connections that you can find

228
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:04,019
but how are you going to discover them

229
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:10,320
and I was at a talk at Brooklyn Jas and

230
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,480
I got to see John Resig talk about this

231
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,040
awesome new thing that he's been working

232
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,839
on sort of branching off of an older

233
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,459
project he's been working on for years

234
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,890
and it was building an art history

235
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,769
database using computer vision with the

236
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:24,240
Frick library and he had actually

237
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
announced that he upped his funding he

238
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,990
got more funding for this project it's

239
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,449
really exciting he showed how clear and

240
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:34,470
concise the queries were for you know

241
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,870
being able to use neo4j in making these

242
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,170
connections with unattributed italian

243
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,130
artwork and i thought that that was

244
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,220
really incredible so you know it's sort

245
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,370
of like of all the technologies I could

246
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,180
use when it comes to trying to discover

247
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,069
cool relationships in recipe search from

248
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,140
ingredients to cuisine you know why not

249
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,500
graph databases so common uses for graph

250
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,620
databases include geospatial problems

251
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,480
recommendation engines network analysis

252
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,829
which is definitely a lot of social

253
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:10,220
network type work and bioinformatics

254
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,360
anywhere that the relationship between

255
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,519
the data is as important as the data

256
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,260
itself so what if you could see

257
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,150
if there are any interesting histories

258
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,340
or similarities you could surface by

259
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,350
doing large scale comparisons of

260
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,300
ingredients and cooking preparation

261
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,720
across millions of recipes so we're

262
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,340
going to dive into a little graph theory

263
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,290
just so that we can make sure that

264
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,090
everyone's kind of grasping the concepts

265
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:42,000
of where neo4j graph database takes you

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,180
so let's get started a graph theory at

267
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,520
its core is the study of graphs in this

268
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,170
case it's a mathematical structure used

269
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,440
to model relations between objects so

270
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,880
they can be slightly different from the

271
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,530
use of word graphs we might be familiar

272
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,780
with but are a powerful way to visually

273
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,930
represent relationships so here you know

274
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,730
we have graph for the initial concept of

275
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,660
my recipe exploration the fundamental

276
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,940
units that form a graph are nodes and

277
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,540
relationships the nodes are here are

278
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,230
represented as the circles I indicates

279
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,050
ingredient are is indicative of recipe

280
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,390
and the dashed circles that I've got our

281
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,730
ingredients that don't actually are not

282
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,500
contained within these recipes so they

283
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,540
have no link to these other these other

284
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,100
nodes so a property graph is made up of

285
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,830
nodes relationships which are these

286
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,190
edges these lines that are connecting

287
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,140
and properties so nodes contain

288
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,870
properties some great insight provided

289
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,320
by online docs I thought it was great

290
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,390
was that you should think of these nodes

291
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,120
as documents that store properties in

292
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,330
the form of arbitrary key value pairs so

293
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,370
the most common graph model application

294
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,680
is is this and it's referred to as the

295
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,110
property graph model the keys are

296
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,760
strings and the values are arbitrary

297
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,270
data types I an neo4j both nodes and

298
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,310
relationships can contain properties and

299
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,600
that's not common across all graph

300
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,710
database types relationships can

301
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,730
relationships connect and structure

302
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,950
notes getting a little excited there a

303
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,870
relationship always has a direction a

304
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,990
label a start node and a Ned node there

305
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,600
are no dangling relationships together

306
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,510
relations a relationships direction and

307
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,250
label add semantic clarity to the

308
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,059
structuring of

309
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,969
notes the ability to add properties to

310
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:35,979
relationships is particularly useful for

311
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:40,699
providing additional metadata for graph

312
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:45,849
so cipher is the query language that we

313
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:49,689
use in neo4j these primitives are all we

314
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:51,309
need to create sophisticated and

315
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,919
semantically rich models so far all of

316
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,179
our models have been in the form of

317
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:57,159
diagrams diagrams are great for

318
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,869
describing grass outside of any

319
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:01,119
technology context but when it comes to

320
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:03,069
using a database you need some other

321
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:05,169
mechanism for creating manipulating and

322
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:08,709
querying data and cipher is it so I

323
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:11,939
immediately appreciated how intuitive

324
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:14,409
cipher was when it took advantage of

325
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:17,709
ASCII art to represent graph patterns

326
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:20,469
I'd still uses sequel like clauses and

327
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,699
keywords such as like match where delete

328
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:26,199
to combine these patterns and specify

329
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,039
desired actions if you so choose so the

330
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,349
first example with the node syntax is

331
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,749
that cipher uses a pair of parentheses

332
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,729
to indicate the nodes which is the

333
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:40,899
ingredient a pair of dashes under my

334
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:43,749
relationship syntax will represent an

335
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,969
undirected relationship so there I've

336
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,669
got a directed relationship laptop with

337
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:50,559
the arrowhead at one point and you can

338
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,419
end up having bracketed expressions as

339
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:55,929
well to be used for details so combining

340
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,579
the syntax for nodes and relationships

341
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:02,409
we can express the patterns below so

342
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:04,899
treating relationships the edges of the

343
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:06,909
graph the connections as a first class

344
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:08,949
object is the fundamental innovation of

345
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,159
graph databases the database doesn't

346
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,379
only just storm information about

347
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,449
individual things it also stores those

348
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,119
relationships between things and that

349
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,669
capability makes it much easier to

350
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:24,219
express sophisticated questions and get

351
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,959
answers in a small fraction of the time

352
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,879
it takes a traditional database those

353
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,949
queries corner of those discoveries can

354
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:31,359
stack on each other and end up giving

355
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,789
you a much richer context the

356
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:35,349
relationships in the database can

357
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:38,129
express the nature of each connection a

358
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:41,409
parent-child owns friend and capture any

359
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:43,520
number a qualitative or quantitative

360
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,130
facts about that relationship so waiting

361
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,430
start and end date because of this you

362
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,410
can write queries that are expressed

363
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,110
constraints I consider this exploratory

364
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,940
modeling it's all in what you're

365
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,460
interested in I can hop pass SI as a

366
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,140
connection and very quickly be delighted

367
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,020
we're disappointed with my results so

368
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,270
small lessons I've learned so far I'd

369
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,920
had a couple of recommendations and seen

370
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,080
some talks influencing what database

371
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,230
would be a good try so it turns out I

372
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,460
don't have a lot of friends that are

373
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,650
attempting to mess around with graph

374
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,300
databases right now so the

375
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,680
recommendations weren't as strong as I

376
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,110
had hoped I initially wanted to use

377
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,510
level graph which is built off of

378
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,180
leveldb and it has a great community of

379
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,120
developers working on it but still what

380
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,880
I considered fairly small group and when

381
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,390
I read the docs I found you know I

382
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,040
looked at the docks and then I compared

383
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,290
them to the other option I had been

384
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,730
recommended to and is also the most

385
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,660
popular right now which is neo4j and

386
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,960
that battle was quickly won by neo4j so

387
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,230
it turned out that neo4j not only had a

388
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,320
huge a wide breadth of developers who

389
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,890
had written projects around it and had

390
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,230
written posts on problems that they had

391
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,410
it had a whole manual a manual of

392
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,320
documentation that included examples

393
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,390
tutorials and links to other community

394
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,790
projects so at that point it was for

395
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,459
someone who was attempting to learn more

396
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,670
about databases by diving into graph

397
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,770
theory and graph databases this was

398
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,850
extremely helpful so the next choice I

399
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,650
had to make and exploring this work was

400
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,420
how the heck would I find a hardy

401
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,640
collection of digitized recipes so

402
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,560
there's no library of congress for

403
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,170
recipes nobody's really working at this

404
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,770
point that i can tell on building an

405
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,890
archive that is open and there's no

406
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,550
central repository for baking yet so we

407
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,600
all make mistakes this is part of mine

408
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,220
and it's a bit silly how quickly it can

409
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,130
pile up but I ended up choosing to

410
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,049
attempt API

411
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:00,049
a calls instead of the down and dirty

412
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,049
job of web scraping the glorious amount

413
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,759
of cooking that is spread across the the

414
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,419
far reaches of the Internet so we're

415
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:09,769
going to take a look at some of the API

416
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,539
a response structures that I had

417
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:19,580
examined as part of this so that's me

418
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,080
trying to get it all of my AP s so all

419
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,629
of these had a decent start for

420
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:29,480
documentation they were nice to approach

421
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,100
this first one that's going to be

422
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,779
scrolling why a buy for quite some time

423
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,960
is big oven they're super developer

424
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,330
friendly but they give me way too much

425
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,509
information the next 1 i've got is at a

426
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:43,460
mom and edamame is a really great i

427
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,259
thought that there are design choices

428
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,529
around the structures that they chose

429
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:50,330
they were clear they made sense and it

430
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,269
was a nice way to to approach getting at

431
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:54,649
information without nesting it too

432
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:56,509
deeply and it also didn't give me the

433
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,149
entire kitchen sink like big oven did

434
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:01,220
big oven tries to give you the

435
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,200
nutritional information for every single

436
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,739
ingredient as well and also tries to

437
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:08,690
convert all of the weights to grams

438
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,419
regardless of whether you want it food

439
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:16,309
to fork is another great API in terms of

440
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:19,039
its accessibility it'll it's affordable

441
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,230
it's free for a lot a larger number of

442
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,609
requests than the other AP is but it

443
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:28,070
gives you no information I think that

444
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,149
there were maybe 12 12 properties it was

445
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:35,690
just terrible so then I got to my my

446
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,399
dream structure the structure that I

447
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:41,570
wanted to see out of my project let's

448
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,570
still go like such a useless amount of

449
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,399
information to me so this is this is my

450
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:52,220
dreamy dreamy structure of an API for

451
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,600
normalizing these api calls so what I

452
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,879
ended up doing with this was trying to

453
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,619
figure out what I wanted for now and

454
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:02,690
what I wanted to build sort of future

455
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,049
proof so I wouldn't have too many holes

456
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:07,879
moving forward when i'm trying to make

457
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:11,240
comparisons and i tried to

458
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,300
I tried to be kind with how I built out

459
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,860
the structure so that I wouldn't have to

460
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,390
do too much work and if other people

461
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,670
wanted to use it as well they wouldn't

462
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,660
either but there's still there's still

463
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,940
work to be done and unfortunately none

464
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,800
of the api's I was working with provided

465
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,780
me with all of these things so the

466
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,690
ultimate goal of this stage one of this

467
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,200
project was to lock down the ingredient

468
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,809
to recipe relationships if I have a

469
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,870
couple of vitamins in my pantry

470
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,429
optimized for the recipes that will

471
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:48,080
acquire the minimum amount of purchasing

472
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,210
when I stop by the grocery store after

473
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,690
work for this one can give weight to the

474
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,840
recipes and that are a perfect match but

475
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,820
this might not be a very exciting recipe

476
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,520
if I've put in five ingredients so my

477
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,080
exact research results is going to come

478
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,780
up with something like pita flour oil

479
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,540
salt yeast water that's not dinner so I

480
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,179
need to do things like being able to

481
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:15,890
expand the search maybe add a few more

482
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,170
ingredients and add in matches such as

483
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,790
something like a category for dinner or

484
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,790
a cuisine like southern food which makes

485
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,530
for our far more delicious results so

486
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,400
stage two of this project is still being

487
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,020
implemented unfortunately so the

488
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,450
limitations of the API is I chose over

489
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,630
web scraping left me with too small of a

490
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,059
data set around cuisine for me to be

491
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:43,730
able to play with it and that also turns

492
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,000
into sort of a layer of the project that

493
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,920
i would have to approach where i might

494
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,040
have to take in large datasets and apply

495
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,960
these tags manually go through and

496
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,570
actually label the cuisine and i don't

497
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,190
know how scientific that would be or if

498
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,520
there's some sort of a recipe science

499
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,020
body that would be angry with me for

500
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,679
applying an inaccurate label of some

501
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,710
sort so again this notion of being able

502
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,900
to discover culinary connections between

503
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,640
cultures could mean I could get to

504
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,910
explore the world through eating instead

505
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,770
of sitting in a library poring over

506
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,050
culinary history you know both are

507
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,669
really interesting but i prefer food

508
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:24,710
experiences that fire on more sense

509
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,039
owners so currently this project is all

510
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,380
command line and neo4j interface which

511
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,750
is a gorgeous web admin by the way a

512
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,299
bunch of fun to work with so what this

513
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:37,580
project isn't is a business it's an

514
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,110
exploration I'm not particularly

515
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,299
interested in starting my own company to

516
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:43,100
compete against the likes of all recipe

517
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,010
yummly I've mentioned prior you know who

518
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,529
have contributed to too much of what you

519
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:50,059
can find on the internet nowadays like

520
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:52,340
I'm very appreciative of that I am

521
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,049
interested in encourage these projects

522
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:55,279
to rethink the way that they've

523
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,440
approached the rich data that they have

524
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,460
at their fingertips so what this project

525
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,090
will be moving forward first I need to

526
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,980
open source it so it's currently a

527
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,330
private repo that will be turned over

528
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:15,200
this week to that github URL and I think

529
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,970
I may end up having some NPM packages

530
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,919
out of that as well and then secondly

531
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,330
we've got you know the web interface

532
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,549
that I was really excited to do but took

533
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:27,440
second you know second place to diving

534
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,850
into these gnarly api api call issues so

535
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,029
you can do fun things like throw a few

536
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:37,460
ingredients into a box and it should

537
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,429
just work you know let let me let my

538
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:43,669
site do the hard work and provide you

539
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:46,399
with some really neat discoveries on

540
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:48,830
things that you would like to cook and

541
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,679
then thirdly i want to convert to

542
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,390
scraping and that's going to be i

543
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,460
imagine a very long project so i would

544
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,409
argue that web scraping might end up

545
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:03,440
giving me some legal trouble but the api

546
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,340
call is expensive and i'm not

547
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,880
particularly interested in giving anyone

548
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,850
recipe api all of my money so they're

549
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,679
still limited they still only have

550
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,649
hundreds of thousands of recipes which i

551
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:22,520
find not enough and that's you know

552
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,130
that's just focusing on my my previous

553
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,830
regrets in the choices so you know let's

554
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,230
let's review we've learned a little bit

555
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,750
about graph theory and you know how

556
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,570
nodes and relationships you know

557
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,269
coincide with recipes ingredients

558
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,929
we've talked a little bit about neo4j

559
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,729
we've got gaps in the current recipe

560
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:45,889
discovery and how helpful documentation

561
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:49,999
can be we've got an idea of approaching

562
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,729
a kinder data structure and all of the

563
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:54,259
mistakes that can go into building an

564
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,119
idea that many people have already

565
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:00,979
interrupted or attempted erupted in this

566
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:03,109
is how I got to be a better program and

567
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,269
you can too so there's a pervasive

568
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:06,619
notion in in many programming

569
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:08,839
communities that trying these sorts of

570
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,879
things can be a waste of effort that

571
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:13,639
they've already been done well or can be

572
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,009
done better in another language while

573
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:19,099
this might be true and that you know at

574
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:21,109
the time of this discouraging whining

575
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:24,259
when someone says that it's it's each

576
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:26,209
person attempting you know these

577
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:28,129
projects a bit out of their reach and

578
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:30,619
potentially yours are you know they're

579
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:32,149
forging a path that contribute in a much

580
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:35,539
larger way in the future so practicing

581
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,099
failure by taking bigger and bigger

582
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:40,519
risks prepares you for eventual look at

583
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,799
even more often endeavors I'd first

584
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,389
considered many of my choices in this

585
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:47,089
project as failures experiencing failure

586
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,909
is universal so you know we can we can

587
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:51,859
go on that together I tried to start a

588
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,269
bakery when I was younger and I had a

589
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:54,829
long table an adventure and having to

590
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,079
let that go I know I can start a bakery

591
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,389
I can feel a little more there you go so

592
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:04,940
why do you care sharing projects that

593
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,109
help us explore and learn to be better

594
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:07,759
programmers through the intersection of

595
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,889
passions is a powerful means of

596
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:11,599
including people from many facets of

597
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,149
life and gather you know getting others

598
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:16,700
to try it so you know do you like graph

599
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,129
theory I don't know I didn't know before

600
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:21,529
this project how about being able to

601
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:23,479
explore unique connections between

602
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,489
ingredients or recipe cuisine yes like

603
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:27,889
that's how I got here so I don't have a

604
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:30,440
formal CS background I'm always reaching

605
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,379
for projects that will help push you

606
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:36,200
know fill in these gaps for me I'd seen

607
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,119
some really cool grata graph database

608
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,559
projects over the years but hadn't

609
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,629
considered myself interested until I

610
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:43,249
found this connection that was

611
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:46,309
meaningful so you know if you do have a

612
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:48,529
passion in this please come chat me up

613
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:50,149
with resources you've been excited about

614
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:51,810
I've got a long way to go

615
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,740
and you know you wanna any way that you

616
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,780
can help communicate data structures and

617
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,490
algorithms better is a great thing to

618
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,030
share so these are this is a very short

619
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,350
list of the resources that that were

620
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,570
available to me and why I approached

621
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,680
this project in the first place and then

622
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,420
most importantly I have to thank so many

623
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,290
people so my co-workers at urban airship

624
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,150
my past mentor Chris Dickinson has been

625
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,700
a huge support Charlie Robbins nerded

626
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,910
out with graph databases far too much

627
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,980
with me on this project and try to take

628
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,790
it from me and you know so many people

629
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,350
on the local community in New York that

630
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,360
have been supporting me in preparing for

631
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,180
this talk and just encouraging each of

632
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,960
us along the way to get here so these

633
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,900
folks deserve some cookies and thank you
