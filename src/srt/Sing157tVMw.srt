00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,610
[Applause]

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,549
all right so my first job in tech was an

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,130
internship at a blockchain company and

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,220
in true startup fashion interns did

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,880
everything from writing documentation to

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,180
getting milk at the grocery store so

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,349
these interns had a variety of

9
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,630
backgrounds and about two weeks into my

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,210
internship I decided to be social and I

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,770
joined some of my colleagues for beers

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,950
and I met the previous intern whose job

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,430
I had taken over and she was perfect

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,809
really like an MIT educated engineer she

15
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,309
had some experience in back-end

16
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,800
development and she was also just like a

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,309
really really nice person and I was

18
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,539
terrified

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,640
really I just kept thinking about like

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,579
how I couldn't compete with her and if

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,410
you're thinking yourself like Carolyn

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,000
like why do you need to compete with her

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,559
like she didn't even work there at the

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,020
same time then you need to understand a

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,439
little bit about my background so I come

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,439
from print journalism and there

27
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,229
everything feels like a competition

28
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,420
there just aren't enough jobs or bylines

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,909
out there for everyone and it doesn't

30
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,439
help that almost every journalism

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,880
student I know thinks that they're gonna

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,280
be like the exception to the rule myself

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,140
included

34
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,729
but because of this I considered all of

35
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,270
my peers competitors and this escalated

36
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,060
to the point that even when some of my

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,210
closest friends were successful I was

38
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,400
left with this like horrible feeling I

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,390
was happy for them like sure but I just

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,960
felt so inadequate and if you let it

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,790
like this kind of feeling can really eat

42
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,070
you alive

43
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,040
so back to my supposed intern competitor

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,250
well we did end up being friends but

45
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,110
that was only because she introduced me

46
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,380
to this concept called shine theory so

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,390
shine theory is a concept created by

48
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,550
Amina to sew and Ann Friedman and

49
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,739
according to their website shine theory

50
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,909
calm it's defined like the

51
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:15,680
Shyne theory is an investment over the

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
long term in helping someone be their

53
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,000
best self and relying on their help in

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,909
return it is a conscious decision to

55
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,340
bring your full self to friendships and

56
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,870
not let insecurity or Envy ravish them

57
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,220
shine theory is a commitment to looking

58
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,689
around at the people in your life and

59
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,510
asking yourself would we be better as

60
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,000
collaborators than competitors and the

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,569
answer is almost always yes and when I

62
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:44,359
first heard about this I was like nah no

63
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:46,879
way this is impossible like there's no

64
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,730
possible way that this can happen which

65
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,980
is an understandable reaction if you've

66
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,700
been socialized to think otherwise but I

67
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,530
gave it a shot and I made the decision

68
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,780
to evaluate all of my newfound tech

69
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,769
relationships through this lens and it's

70
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:07,819
wilds like how wrong I was before turns

71
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,230
out that this community can be

72
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,099
incredibly kind to you if you let it and

73
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:15,439
for me just this small mindsets which

74
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,799
really enabled me to establish a group

75
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,560
of like unbelievably supportive people

76
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,049
who have like seen me through a career

77
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:26,389
change they support me and take me

78
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:27,889
seriously when I explore new ideas

79
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:31,430
despite what my CV might say and you

80
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,690
know they pushed me into new

81
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,139
opportunities like public speaking or

82
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:38,359
organizing a meet-up and while some of

83
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:39,859
these relationships are kind of like a

84
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,109
mentor-mentee structure most of them

85
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:45,229
aren't rather I've learned how to look

86
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:47,239
horizontally and learn from my peers

87
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:49,519
which wouldn't have been possible with

88
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,030
my mindset that I had four years ago on

89
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,310
the other side I'm slowly learning how

90
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,180
to pay it forward

91
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,180
so I'm trying to learn how to find the

92
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,919
joy in watching other people achieve

93
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,959
their goals and supporting them along

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,659
their way towards that goal and it's

95
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:08,510
been a process but so far investing in

96
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,949
others has turned out to be a really

97
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,120
good way to invest in myself but it can

98
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,650
be hard to practice shine theory I

99
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,720
understand that and even after years of

100
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,799
working on it I still fail sometimes for

101
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:24,050
example a new junior developer was added

102
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,210
to my team about a month ago

103
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,090
and before that me as the current least

104
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,250
experienced developer on the team was

105
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,940
like immediately freaked out and I kept

106
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,130
asking questions like okay but what if

107
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,930
she comes in and she's better than me or

108
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,949
what if she comes in and she's better

109
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,990
than me now and like wouldn't that be

110
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,490
really embarrassing will I still get a

111
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,479
promotion like I spiraled really but now

112
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,639
I'm able to recognize those feelings and

113
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,220
not let them consume me because I know

114
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,340
that they're misleading and even if

115
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,860
something does go wrong I now have a

116
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,400
support system to help me through it and

117
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,539
I would have never learned how to do

118
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,580
this without the community to teach me

119
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,350
that this is even possible so thank you

120
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,250
[Applause]
