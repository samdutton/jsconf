00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,620

today I'm gonna talk about cross from

2
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,620
native app development and its

3
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,860
architecture by the way my name is Alton

4
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,590
Shango I'm coming to manage it off smart

5
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:58,690
face inc is it a second sorry ok now

6
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,980
good right God we're based on parlor

7
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,680
altar in San Franciscan our R&D center

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,420
in Turkey we just write our own ID and

9
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,320
to make you guys all you know JavaScript

10
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,810
right and you all front-end developers

11
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,320
to write their own native mobile apps

12
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,690
for Android and is easily that's why

13
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,310
I'll show you that how we done that

14
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,840
first of all there are lots of questions

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,040
asking their people asking me that are

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,320
you like a phonegap or something that's

17
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,119
why I need to first figure out those

18
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:42,970
apps you know first section of the

19
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,280
mobile apps web-based steps probably

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,080
most of you know of that just writing

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,510
your HTML and JavaScript and CSS codes

22
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,880
there's a single code base then let's go

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,610
on mobile browsers also but it depends

24
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,710
on the JavaScript engine inside you know

25
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,950
some gecko some web kit and chromium etc

26
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,400
and don't give the mobile and users that

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,069
they're used to know UI and UX and also

28
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,469
because of the running on the web

29
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:13,840
browser it's little slow and not fluent

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,470
but

31
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,240
most important thing is not accessing

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,960
device api's that's why the solution is

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,600
phonegap most of probably know that

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,850
phonegap everything same with web apps

35
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,430
but phonegap put the plug ins inside and

36
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,500
you're writing those structure and

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,390
you're getting again single code base

38
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,720
and accessing some device API but again

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,420
sometimes not fast enough and you are

40
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,030
the UX may not be accepted that's why

41
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,450
and also we have native apps which is

42
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,760
objective c and java written probably

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,740
that's why here is a cross-platform

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,220
solution maybe most of you knows or not

45
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,300
but there are some examples for that

46
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,250
titanium we have we examine also we have

47
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,770
smart face apps to do and i'll show how

48
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,880
all these cross platform tools works

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,040
ninety-nine percent they work safe let's

50
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,310
start with it here's our architecture

51
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,040
but here is this architecture probably

52
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,760
most of them you know all the devices

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,519
which is Android and iOS devices comes

54
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,060
with the same not say comes with native

55
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,030
libraries inside their own Java and

56
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,310
objective-c written libraries that's why

57
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,250
what we've done we took WebKit you know

58
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,360
WebKit one and take out the drm inside

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,850
and put our core engine what our core

60
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,690
engine doing you're writing your

61
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,769
JavaScript code and we compile this

62
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,750
engine JavaScript engine for iOS like

63
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,850
Apple did it for iOS 7 also you're

64
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,250
writing your JavaScript code and we

65
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:03,190
wrote c++ wrappers c++ wrappers and put

66
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,070
into core engine and this is looking

67
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,180
this is looking for java and objective-c

68
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,459
libraries inside the devices and

69
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,850
matching your javascript code into that

70
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,760
libraries and that's why after that we

71
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,970
took all those calls to the C++ pool and

72
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,729
after that your javascript code which is

73
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,400
maybe you're calling an action bar or

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,420
navigation part

75
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,660
bar or some labels or some image

76
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,420
components are all components and we're

77
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,210
reading them and matching into native

78
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,790
libraries inside to all the devices like

79
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,050
is six are you 7 android 4.4 4.3

80
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,820
learning model and after that those

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,820
libraries working running on the user

82
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,130
interface layer and we're putting some

83
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,440
other extension tools like x-ray light

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,460
and others this is all architecture

85
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,970
that's why the differences between

86
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,040
phonegap and others web-based solutions

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,140
that's why it's cross platform solutions

88
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,160
for we are getting both native APK or

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,820
IPA for iOS and user interface layer all

90
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:24,970
natively working after that we wrote and

91
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,710
what you see is what you get designer

92
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,640
which I'll show you that and some other

93
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,160
stuffs I'm not going to read those parts

94
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,570
are just making a live demo VT and

95
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:42,390
you'll see how it works I'll explain

96
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,970
your architecture while I was live

97
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:53,760
coding by the way

98
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,690
okay here's our studio you know making a

99
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,460
mobile apps is such a disaster while if

100
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,110
you're designing your app because

101
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,330
designing the app is we thought that

102
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,460
fifty percent app app development

103
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,830
generally that's why we wrote our own

104
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,430
idea this idea is our own ID written by

105
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,750
C++ only reason to writing the ID is for

106
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,620
design editor I'll show you how it works

107
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,710
here is our UI component which we sorted

108
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,930
here UI components network components

109
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,720
and other components under most of the

110
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,060
native UI components here listed and

111
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,069
some of them are not distant also here

112
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:38,770
show navigation bar or action bar let's

113
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,130
show you if you these UI components

114
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,169
working with drag-and-drop tools for

115
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,240
example you just drag image component

116
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,710
into the design area and you can choose

117
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,409
the data for example let's put on a

118
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:57,039
picture and make it stretch and you can

119
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,349
check it out here it comes here actor

120
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:06,520
why I'll put text button here is button

121
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,389
comes change the color of the button

122
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,750
change the name of the button add new

123
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,069
phones anchoring effects etc put for

124
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,860
example switch button here to make a

125
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,539
switch button works for something and

126
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:24,880
put a map view component for example

127
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,060
here again we are working for

128
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,969
cross-platform and that's why if you're

129
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:34,120
if end-user if customer download this

130
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,289
app from App Store he's going to see a

131
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,599
Apple maps and if you download it from

132
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,909
Google Play Store is going to see Google

133
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,400
Maps and you don't need to write any

134
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,250
single line of code to make it available

135
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,219
just it's working like that for example

136
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:53,800
adding AdMob component code reader and

137
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,050
other things here for example also

138
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,800
adding some native compost navigation

139
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,279
bar Oh action bar is also available here

140
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,020
after you're designing app this easily

141
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,630
this what you see is what you get

142
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,550
editor that's why I'll show you that

143
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,370
here for example I'll make this like

144
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,020
this what I mean with what you see is

145
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,180
what you get design editor when I put

146
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,250
that component here you can see the

147
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,830
coordinates here weight height x and y

148
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,960
coordinates for example y con is two

149
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,510
point 92 ratio it means it will it will

150
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,039
exactly you can see that in the device

151
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,160
like 2.92 raid 2 you're under the screen

152
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,280
all the devices all iOS devices all

153
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,010
Android devices going to work with this

154
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,760
design language ok let's see in action

155
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,020
ah for example let's edit here edit box

156
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,430
that's a little bit customizes at the

157
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,310
box for example I just only want to

158
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,810
write numbers inside ok here is design

159
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,230
finish oh you know mobile apps designing

160
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,780
it page by page and adding new pages and

161
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,060
make a connection between that after

162
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,340
that lets go come back the script editor

163
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,200
this is one hundred percent cigrip

164
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,260
editor which means as I mention you

165
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,820
before we took WebKit and take out the

166
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,910
do em inside outside that's why you can

167
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,170
do everything with javascript in the

168
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,570
script editor without the arm I don't

169
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,020
say i forgot to say about architecture

170
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,630
why we're not using drm because we just

171
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,290
don't want your CSS or other some custom

172
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,280
plot against draw things because if you

173
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,790
drove things like CSS like PhoneGap or

174
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,040
other solutions it makes it web

175
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,440
application that's why we don't want to

176
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,870
see any web components inside we just

177
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,390
want to see all native user experience

178
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,130
that's why all native components only

179
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,610
available for example let's writing some

180
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,880
javascript code it's too easy for all of

181
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,140
us probably ok let's change me that this

182
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,440
button name for example let's make it

183
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,180
text button ok

184
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,790

box text and also we wrote some good

199
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,430
components to make you write your apps

200
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,220
easily for example data co network

201
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,680
component you know we can't think any

202
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,350
app without Jason arrest or show up

203
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,270
sometimes it's a little bit hard to

204
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,080
parse and transfer two components that

205
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,260
those Jason's or rests that's why we

206
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,460
wrote most of wizards here for example

207
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,820

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,470
i'll show the others after that point if

218
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,200
you when you finish your app just choose

219
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,930
the profile android our iOS for example

220
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,970
let's choose R Us and click on the

221
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,070
single button device simulator when you

222
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,030
connect your device

223
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,800
when you connect your device when it

224
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,080

touch it transfer my apps file sorry

226
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:50,570
into app okay and after that my app

228
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,400
seen on the screen will be on the device

229
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,090

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,360
native art box here as switch button for

233
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,400

234
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,710
that's all and also you can get the same

235
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:22,170

i'll show you our dataset sorry yes it

240
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,690

242
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,899

243
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,570

244
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,100
child just clicking on the which strings

245
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,889
of rose I want to use and after click on

246

that its routes on the table like this

247
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,589
and after that point when it rise here

248
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:28,079
to put in one of the label for example

249
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,550
