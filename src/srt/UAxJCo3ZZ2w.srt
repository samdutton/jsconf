2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,200
I'm gonna do a quick intro we are using

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,750
create react app but then there was the

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,359
react license thing going on and then we

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,970
saw that for react 16 as you can see

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,390
here it's not gonna be very good for web

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,150
components and any external libraries

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,119
used so we were like hey what else can

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,550
we do so we stopped react and we try to

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,120
find a way to switch over to pre-act

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
which what priya compact can use the

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,520
same API as react but we might smaller

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,460
have nice support for external libraries

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,090
and web components and all this stuff so

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,590
I'm gonna show this to you and like five

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:00,480
steps start the step zero so first you

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,480
set up a project with create react app

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,000
and what you get is a hundred and twenty

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,640
three kilobyte javascript file which

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,939
does nothing it's a 38 after gzipping

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,530
but of course all of this has to be

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,939
parsed and it's quite big this is how it

23
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:18,299
looks

24
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,930
react just react Dom takes up 80% of the

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,020
whole thing so then I was looking at how

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,509
this whole thing is built up and and

27
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,000
well what I found you can do is you take

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
the scripts that react is using which is

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,299
this in react scripts build and real

30
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,670
scripts start and then you just hack web

31
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,159
pack to replace anything that's react

32
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,990
with pre-act compare and react down

33
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,780
would also create combat so this way

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,229
when you run build or run start then you

35
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,500
will actually get pre act in your code

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,719
for testing it's a bit trickier what

37
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,610
what you need to do is replace a bunch

38
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,770
of stuff in just you can check this repo

39
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,730
the URLs up there if you can read it and

40
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,470
I did need to hack it a bit

41
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,620
I take the module constructor of note to

42
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,800
resolve the just config to this replace

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,090
just config and you write test a little

44
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,530
bit differently but you have render and

45
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,200
shallow render and you can have snapshot

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,050
testing and run stuff there's also this

47
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,320
hack which is because of Babel pre-sale

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,980
react that itself and source but

49
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,210
basically you're still writing the same

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,930
code and it becomes 38 kilobytes before

51
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,010
gzipping and 13 afterwards so after this

52
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,830
I was looking at what else can I do so I

53
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,580
I was like okay we don't need ie 9 and

54
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,630
10 so you can patch be able to use ie 11

55
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,950
as a target I also made a really really

56
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,900
shitty less compiler with watch which

57
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,180
you just changed some stuff where is

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,790
thank you Jason it's gone here that you

59
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,070
build the CSS and wash the CSS when you

60
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,470
start or build or test or whatever then

61
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,209
our security guys were like hey we need

62
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,580
some resource integrity right now and I

63
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,739
still didn't want AJ because I just

64
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,570
don't want to maintain wet pad coffee

65
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,150
because it's all the same everywhere why

66
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,050
should you so you go in and you push to

67
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,390
the plugins to add the ESRI plug-in to

68
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,640
web pack and it just works out of the

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,410
box so yeah you can check the repo here

70
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:55,110
and still have one minute so here's a

71
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,300
picture of my cat

72
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,210
