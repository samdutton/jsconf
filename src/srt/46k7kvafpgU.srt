1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,189

alright so I wanted to talk about the

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,130
recent use of JavaScript and some

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,990
industries that we might be less

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,340
familiar with so by old line I mean

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,880
industries that aren't using the world

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,840
wide web as part as essential to their

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,160
operation on a day-to-day basis so semi

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,430
conductor is one that immediately comes

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,070
to mind aerospace lots of industries in

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:50,619
manufacturing biology pharmaceuticals

11
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:54,539
plastics lots of companies sort of

12
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,469
outside of our world of kind of the

13
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,690
World Wide Web so here's one example of

14
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,420
a company in the south bay that does on

15
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,610
genomic sequencing for medical purposes

16
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,210
and I love seeing this job posts because

17
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,270
I would imagine they'd be hiring like a

18
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,360
PLC programmer or a c-sharp programmer

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,530
or a C++ programmer but they're hiring

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,560
an angular programmer to make dashboards

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,950
which i think is something that we've

22
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,189
only started to see in like the past

23
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:39,060
three or four years like these these

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,560
types of companies weren't really

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,619
looking for JavaScript programmers three

26
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,210
or four years ago so like why is that

27
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,570
why why is javascript suddenly coming on

28
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,450
the scene in these other you know these

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,649
other classes of companies so I used to

30
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,159
work at this solar cell plant and that's

31
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,960
actually where i learned javascript and

32
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,759
i was making internal websites that

33
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,920
never that were never seen by the world

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,390
wide web

35
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,870
we had we were collecting all this data

36
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,330
from the manufacturing line and it was

37
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,540
going into a my sequel database and we

38
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,300
had to present all that information to

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,630
the engineers and the factory workers so

40
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,550
everyone could easily see what was going

41
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,120
on and I had never done anything like

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,900
this before and being you know I guess a

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,770
millennial the natural the way that

44
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,330
seemed most natural to display that

45
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,000
information was using a browser so we we

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
built this sort of dashboarding system

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,459
using javascript and kind of the tools

48
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,040
you know people here are really familiar

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,620
with but if people if people in these

50
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,250
industries aren't using javascript and

51
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,500
websites to display this kind of

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,590
information and what what are they using

53
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,950
what have people been using you know for

54
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,519
the past 50 years in these kinds of like

55
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,040
old line manufacturing industries and

56
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,260
one on one program that's really common

57
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,970
that some of you guys might have heard

58
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,750
of if you had fewer in grad school or

59
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,670
you worked in a lab and college is

60
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,250
LabVIEW so like a really typical

61
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,570
paradigm believe it or not for these

62
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,980
companies where their labs or

63
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,500
manufacturing lines is you'll have one

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,030
computer that's like the dashboard

65
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,489
computer and if you want to go and check

66
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,130
what's going on in the lab you like put

67
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,440
on your bunny suit you go into the lab

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,049
and then you check the dashboard and

69
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,910
you're like okay great everything's okay

70
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,790
and you go back out out of the lab and

71
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,910
into the office or you might have some

72
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,980
kind of like remote desktop system so

73
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,510
that if you're at home you can check in

74
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,489
on the lab computer which it's which

75
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,810
sounds so ridiculous when you could just

76
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,140
use a browser but a lot of companies

77
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,560
still sort of work this way the

78
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,480
the company that makes lab views a

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,080
billion-dollar company just to sort of

80
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,810
like show the extent of how much these

81
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,820
kind of desktop dashboard programs are

82
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,400
still in use so dashboarding i think is

83
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,360
in my mind kind of the entry point or

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,690
has been the entry point for javascript

85
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,060
coming onto the scene and some of these

86
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,320
more some of these older school

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,160
industries and that's that's really

88
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,470
thanks to a lot of a lot of like the

89
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,200
easy and nice plotting tools that are

90
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,870
available now like d3 the Google charts

91
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,760
API digraphs it's just really it's

92
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,590
really easy to spin up charts in a

93
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,060
browser now and all those tools are free

94
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,790
so versus paying a few thousand dollars

95
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,520
for a program like LabVIEW there's been

96
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,919
a lot of kind of recent interest in

97
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,979
figuring out how to in sort of

98
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,150
scientists that don't have any

99
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,820
programming or JavaScript background to

100
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,340
learn enough to be able to make to make

101
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,860
dashboards and displays like these so

102
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,950
you know dashboarding to me is kind of

103
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,479
the entry point for these types of

104
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,460
industries but I think there are maybe

105
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,630
other future uses of JavaScript in these

106
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,220
sort of scientific and older school

107
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,280
engineering industries and one that I

108
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,320
think is really interesting is technical

109
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,340
computing like the the very early days

110
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,220
of technical computing were in C and

111
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,870
then there was Fortran and then there is

112
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,270
matlab and a lot of people use Python

113
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,600
now and now there are people working on

114
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,229
julia and technical computing is you

115
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:30,510
know it's like a it's a it's a branch of

116
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,039
programming that's really needed to

117
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,729
solve to solve math program math

118
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,070
problems that you know we can't solve

119
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,569
analytically and we need a

120
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,710
you to resolve and there are some people

121
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,679
that are you know starting to do the

122
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:49,349
groundwork for that would be needed to

123
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:53,369
do technical computing in JavaScript hmm

124
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:56,689
one person is this fellow McCollough

125
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:00,199
who's starting to do a lot of sort of

126
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,389
basic work and like how how do we store

127
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,279
matrices in javascript in an efficient

128
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,869
way just kind of like a lot of the

129
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:10,499
really fundamental work that would be

130
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:13,860
necessary to solve these types of

131
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,279
problems in JavaScript then another you

132
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,949
know potential future JavaScript

133
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:25,020
application in these industries that we

134
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,689
don't really see now but who knows 5-10

135
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:30,649
years could become commonplace is

136
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,719
instrumentation so there's this company

137
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,159
in berkeley tehsil that's making these

138
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,569
microcontrollers that you can program in

139
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,360
java script which which is something new

140
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,899
and cool and this is really just you

141
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,719
know for fruit insurers and hobbyists so

142
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,889
far but you know maybe in the future

143
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,599
this is sort of like a typical plc

144
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,039
programmable logic controller display

145
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,039
that would control some some type of

146
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,459
machinery in a factory and they're

147
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,529
typically program using c sharp or some

148
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,990
kind of graphical programming languages

149
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,169
but you know maybe in 5-10 years

150
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:14,759
javascript will change enough and so

151
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,800
many people will know javascript that

152
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,409
you know it won't be uncommon that you

153
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:22,919
program something like a programmable

154
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:28,759
logic controller in javascript and then

155
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,889
i work for a company called plot lee and

156
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:39,360
we really focus on sort of this the

157
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,539
scientific plotting part of what

158
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,480
javascript has to offer to the

159
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,100
scientific community in these types of

160
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,209
industries and the nice thing that you

161
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:53,360
get out of plotting and javis

162
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,550
it is there are all these great tools

163
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,589
like d3 and you get interactivity so

164
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:01,970
these chart on these charts you can

165
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,130
hover and you can zoom and you can pan

166
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,640
around and if you compare that to MATLAB

167
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,899
or LabVIEW or kind of other common

168
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:15,589
scientific software right now you don't

169
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,540
get that kind of interactivity so it's

170
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,320
it's hard to imagine going back from

171
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,800
that so you know there are a lot of

172
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,420
people in the scientific community that

173
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:33,170
think javascript is here to stay at

174
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,709
least for for visualizing data because

175
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:44,100
the upsides you get in interactivity

176
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,339
then finally I just wanted to mention

177
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,930
that potli has a node API so if any of

178
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,670
you guys are working on node projects

179
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,920
where you want to plot some data are our

180
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,600
API is on NPM and it's free and supports

181
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,089
pretty much any any type of chart so
