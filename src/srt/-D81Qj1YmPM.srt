00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,009

thanks for the introduction there I

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,170
always like to start a talk with a

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,429
little bit of a personal note so

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,650
cameraman you can cut and you know my

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,110
talk is not starting yet it's my first

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,750
time to Oakland so thanks so much for

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,170
having me I'm really happy to come here

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,900
and I wanted to embarrass Carolina and

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,150
just say thank you thank you for running

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,830
such a such a great conference so far

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,920
and to have a conference with more

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,980
female speakers than male is something

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,170
that so so good and you should you

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,430
should definitely be very proud of the

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,110
work that you've done because I'm very

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,860
proud of you so good job okay let's get

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,050
started my talk today is called useful

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,320
front end metrics my name is ben

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,610
schwartz i'm at ben schwartz on

20
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,910
basically everything on the internet so

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,410
i'm going to go through i'm going to get

22
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,559
through performance stuff in general um

23
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,170
you've probably seen talks before about

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,739
performance and you know we kind of hear

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,119
the same things time and time again so I

26
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,950
wanted to cover kind of what those

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,939
things are here's the scuba time is

28
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,090
money everybody knows that it's really

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,740
great the time equals money on the

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,540
internet because it allows us to qualify

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,030
when we when we do performance work and

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,520
we make people terrified and we actually

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,200
get to spend time thinking about our

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,700
architecture and thinking about how we

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,500
can improve our code bases for ourselves

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,630
and for our teams and for the businesses

37
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,000
that were representing it's really great

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,439
that it equates to money so i think

39
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,909
that's that's something that we can

40
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,619
establish that we all kind of know that

41
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,299
time equals money when a website is slow

42
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,700
it costs money when they're slow sales

43
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,549
drop engagement drops abandonment Rises

44
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,189
we've heard this time and time again and

45
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,840
it's how we're able to you know to keep

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,149
going amazon found that when they

47
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,770
increased their their page speed by 100

48
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,409
milliseconds it equated to one percent

49
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,540
of their revenue which is kind of crazy

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,219
it's not really a metric that you can

51
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,860
use for your business definitely but it

52
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,660
definitely works for amazon so maybe if

53
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,310
you go work for them you're going to be

54
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,270
saving them a lot of money and get a

55
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,930
healthy bonus

56
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,080
forty percent of people about a website

57
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,490
that takes more than three seconds to

58
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,820
load that's that's from KISSmetrics last

59
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,970
year i believe and their 2nd stat which

60
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,050
also is kind of interesting is that

61
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,700
forty-seven percent of consumers expect

62
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,000
a page load in two seconds or less and I

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,480
don't know about you but I look at a lot

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,270
of pages every day and I would say that

65
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,550
probably about ten percent of them load

66
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,130
in two seconds or less particularly on a

67
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,750
phone so someone that is doing an

68
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,430
amazing amount of work in the

69
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,780
performance base in general is ilya

70
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,870
gorrik he works for for Google's one of

71
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,240
the chrome team members and he said that

72
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,160
after a second or more the uses flow and

73
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,080
engagement with the initiated task is

74
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,460
broken and he's actually talking about

75
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,140
an interaction where somebody clicks on

76
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,810
something and they wait for more than a

77
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,940
second so we've often heard that school

78
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,010
of thought of an animation shouldn't

79
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,870
probably last for more than a quarter of

80
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,630
a second he's saying that if you make

81
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,980
them wait and they don't see anything

82
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,650
within one second they just kind of this

83
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,350
mental blank comes to them and then they

84
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,730
just move on etsy learned that when they

85
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,250
added 160 k to a page they actually got

86
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,740
a 12-percent plus bounce rate on mobile

87
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,120
which is a pretty alarming stat from

88
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,640
this is uh it's it's actually a graph

89
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,170
but it's it's abstract so it doesn't

90
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,290
really matter but from 2010 until 2014

91
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,180
response size grew by two and a half

92
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,370
times so your average response side this

93
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,670
is taken from the HTTP archive grew from

94
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,360
about 700 k to somewhere like the 1800

95
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,390
ish be on there and that's that's pretty

96
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,940
crazy because mobile phones like he was

97
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,920
talking about this it was Adam he

98
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,870
mentioned that you know you just go down

99
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,580
to the pier and suddenly your phone

100
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,900
doesn't work and you can't tweet it

101
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,550
anybody and you can't actually meet that

102
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,540
friend that you're trying to check the

103
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,190
map to go see them or anything like that

104
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,710
and about that really sucks and I think

105
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,140
we can all emphasize with that so let's

106
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,930
start start a rule everyone is on your

107
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,760
team is responsible for the performance

108
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,590
of your side Steve Souders back in 2008

109
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,530
stated that eighty to ninety percent of

110
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,490
old sort of perceived speed is basically

111
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,139
because of the front end so it's not our

112
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,889
job right it's everybody's job people

113
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,169
like developers who work on the back

114
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:39,790
ends will say that you know the servers

115
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,160
are really fast and we've got sequel

116
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,830
queries or super amazing and we got all

117
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,240
these amazing architecture but it

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,720
doesn't matter like it's in the front so

119
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,190
what do we already know what are the

120
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,980
rules of engagement what we do to make

121
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,280
sides fast we minify everything okay

122
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,730
cool we use async JavaScript's we know

123
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,950
that base64 in large fonts can block

124
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,750
other styles from loading so if you load

125
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,700
every font in the world and base64 them

126
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,060
you're basically blocking the browser

127
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,590
what else we should animate using CSS

128
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,350
and not JavaScript we should use

129
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,120
requestanimationframe for JavaScript

130
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,460
based animation so this actually takes

131
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,790
the time of when the browser would

132
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,800
naturally paint it will call the

133
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,810
requestanimationframe loop and it's an

134
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,800
opportunity for you to be I would

135
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,030
actually draw something to the screen so

136
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,979
this is really great for canvas or for

137
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,360
WebGL or whatever another thing we can

138
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,410
do is we can use video rather than gifts

139
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,760
if I actually can't believe I just said

140
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,740
that everyone you should definitely

141
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,700
follow your dreams and use a gift

142
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,190
because they make you happy we know that

143
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,050
changing a paucity transforms clipped

144
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,610
and filters are cheap because they're

145
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,570
hot way hardware-accelerated we've

146
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,950
learned recently and I was talking to

147
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,830
mark about this for bootstrap that

148
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,720
position fixed can cause really

149
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,120
interesting repaints and read roars when

150
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,280
you're scrolling and they found the

151
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,750
performance in bootstrap when kind of

152
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,550
kind of crazy and so they actually

153
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,950
pulled all that those hacks out without

154
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,169
adding translate 3d to try and push

155
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,210
something to another like compositing

156
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:22,270
layer in the browser wasn't worth doing

157
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,350
so we're learning these things people

158
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,520
are talking about them time and time

159
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,540
again box-shadow can actually be kind of

160
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,190
evil here's my browser using just box

161
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,010
shadows on these chrome logos and just

162
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,450
doing some basic scrolling and as you

163
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,540
can see the performance goes from pretty

164
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,960
great too pretty abysmal and of course

165
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,610
the chrome team talking talking a lot

166
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,830
about make your make your animation 60

167
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,150
frames a second and try and strive to

168
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,950
get there in May 2013 addy Osmani ran

169
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,169
through an amazing pitchfork special

170
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,970
Daft Punk mini side just before their

171
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,940
album came out where the scope scroll

172
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,440
performance was less than ideal and I

173
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,580
don't know how many people will actually

174
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,980
remember this I certainly do I was I was

175
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,380
really interested in the the full screen

176
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,090
video and typographically I was

177
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,640
interesting and I just them as a group

178
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,280
we're doing interesting stuff but it

179
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,250
really performed like crap Eddie has a

180
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,040
really great article on his blog you can

181
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,440
see here he's actually profiling the the

182
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,470
60 frames per second mock just up here

183
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,310
and you'll see that it's barely doing 30

184
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,840
and it's jumping all over the place and

185
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,910
it really gives you the idea of that the

186
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,680
browser and your machine are struggling

187
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,370
so that side feels like crap so let's

188
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,440
CPU burning painting and heavy effects

189
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,150
equals less battery bone I think

190
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,410
everyone can actually agree with that

191
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:54,110
too here's a rule let me load what you

192
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,150
need this this comes from Patrick

193
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,240
Heyman's talk at CSS comfy you fantastic

194
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,860
talk Patrick works for the Guardian and

195
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,520
he talked about what CSS you need to

196
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,100
deliver your side and in this example

197
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,400
he's talking about basically the fold so

198
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,410
at the Guardian they did a study of what

199
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,760
they as an organization consider

200
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,870
important content so in their case the

201
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,750
article the story that's what they're

202
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,740
writing that's what they're producing

203
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,140
that's their their product that's the

204
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,570
really important part about this page

205
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,240
the comments not really never read the

206
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,690
comments anyway right sharing related

207
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,760
content and popular content they're not

208
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,460
important so what the Guardian actually

209
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,570
going do is render that article content

210
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,970
first and then later go and load in the

211
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,770
sharing related content popular content

212
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,080
using Ajax or maybe local storage

213
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,150
depending on sort of how that works for

214
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,330
them and beyond that they experimented

215
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,310
with actually in lining their CSS so

216
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,350
this is something that Adam also touched

217
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,230
on where it sits like a bit of a secret

218
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,060
that you should never use inline styles

219
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,040
because it's disgusting or something and

220
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,080
you should kill kittens if you do but

221
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,390
what they found is when they inlined

222
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,050
their CSS that was just the above the

223
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,890
fold CSS the actual critical path styles

224
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,420
their performance on for on content load

225
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,010
and for Dom ready dropped by six to

226
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,110
seven hundred milliseconds now when

227
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,910
you're on a phone six to seven hundred

228
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,620
milliseconds if you've got a budget of

229
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,870
two seconds or maybe one try and get

230
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,090
contents you users that's pretty

231
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,780
significant I think we can agree that

232
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,250
okay so now that we've we've sort of

233
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,020
talked about all these things that you

234
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,120
should and shouldn't do and you know

235
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,860
everyone knows everything about

236
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,660
performance right so we just minify

237
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,320
scripts and don't do anything stupid and

238
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,580
everything's fine right so okay cool

239
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,440
I'll see you um that's not the truth how

240
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,880
do we how do we know that what we've

241
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,180
been told or what we've learned years

242
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,940
ago or what we've discovered on the last

243
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,320
project we worked on how do we know that

244
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:16,870
that's actually true

245
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,640
set a budget so how much is too much if

246
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,970
you're a Content Heaviside this this

247
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,130
screenshot is taken from a site that I

248
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,290
believe it was a news site and so their

249
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,130
content changes on a hourly basis their

250
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,860
image size on the very last point is two

251
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,630
points view yeah two points who makes

252
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,940
which is quite a lot of quite a lot of

253
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,720
images if you set a budget for images

254
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,310
suddenly you can have really interesting

255
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,680
conversations with your team you can

256
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,060
talk about what's acceptable and what's

257
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,910
unacceptable you can say if we go over

258
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,610
to Meg's we need to reconsider this or

259
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,130
maybe we can drop one story for mobile

260
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,660
devices or maybe just not load them

261
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,650
because we're going to do mobile first

262
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,900
in the first place and for a designer

263
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,070
this is actually a really interesting

264
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,920
point do we really need that insanely

265
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,530
huge banner of that perfect looking rich

266
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,900
couple but everybody hates anyway what

267
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,880
so set a budget and monitor all the

268
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:24,510
things i wanted to mention just

269
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,420
real-time monitoring in general if

270
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,160
you've ever logged into google analytics

271
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,290
you'll you'll maybe have noted that you

272
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,290
can get to an average page time load

273
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,840
time and on this particular site it

274
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,040
dived up on this one day to 14 seconds

275
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,930
which is quite a lot I think we can all

276
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,570
agree this is the real thing that your

277
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,730
users are seeing so no matter how many

278
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,260
times you run you're like grunts scripts

279
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,250
and you think you're doing the best

280
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,400
thing in the world this is the real deal

281
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,260
this is what people are seeing and this

282
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,870
is what gives you dada to tell you

283
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,610
should we use a CDN should we not do

284
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,070
when we added one did it help what could

285
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,240
we do next but aside from that we can

286
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,260
actually do our own metrics in a side so

287
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,820
here's the San Francisco Chronicle I

288
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,300
don't know if that's like a good good

289
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,010
newspaper to show here but actually want

290
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,630
to show you this API here this is window

291
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,240
window performance timing what window

292
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,839
performance timing is is the HTML

293
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,660
timings so you can go into any side in

294
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,740
your browser right now and you

295
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,750
go and type this window top performing

296
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,750
star timing and it'll give you the any

297
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,000
redirect times it'll give you any delays

298
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,060
that happens with your with your HTML

299
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,110
it'll tell you when Don content loaded

300
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,770
actually occurred and just getting these

301
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,270
metrics I mean Google are pulling these

302
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,620
into analytics for you but you could

303
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,850
actually go and do your own stuff in

304
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,040
your test suite and if your site goes be

305
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,899
understood a number you can alert for

306
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:58,500
that in addition to the the HTML timings

307
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,740
we can also get some additional data

308
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,990
here we can actually get every resource

309
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:15,390
in your page go video we going to go I

310
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:21,879
don't know

311
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:25,449
it's not going mmm that's a video right

312
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:29,600
you know thank you okay so here I've

313
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,069
actually called window performance get

314
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:33,499
entries and you'll see that it's given

315
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:36,049
us a whole bunch of resource timing

316
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,959
entries each one of these in this case

317
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,689
this one was a resource you can see the

318
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:44,089
script that it actually was we can see

319
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,559
all the timings we can see if it

320
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,540
redirected so obviously putting

321
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,639
redirects on resources in your page is

322
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,259
terrible for performance and we can

323
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,139
track that so what I want to encourage

324
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,759
you to do is actually going to use these

325
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,949
these two simple really like super

326
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:00,499
simple API s go and put those in and

327
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,299
track some metrics and Ajax it back to

328
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,589
your server so that you can actually go

329
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,329
and track that for yourself and have

330
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:07,069
your own numbers you don't have to fight

331
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:08,569
for your you know your boss to let you

332
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:10,249
use Google Analytics or whatever other

333
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,230
analytic tool there is or something that

334
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,519
costs money where you have to sign up

335
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,199
for it you can just go and do this and

336
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,459
then just beacon it back to your server

337
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:17,689
which i think is actually really

338
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:22,819
empowering as a front-end developer so

339
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:25,369
those two to AP is super simple there's

340
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:28,040
a performance timing and then there's

341
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,110
get entries get entries you can also say

342
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,939
get entries by type and you can say get

343
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,679
entries by type of resource or get

344
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,949
entries by type another one there's a

345
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:40,549
three of work but coming back to the

346
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:42,529
Guardian example that I showed earlier I

347
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:43,959
think there's something interesting here

348
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,059
we can actually go and track metrics

349
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,169
custom metrics for stuff like how long

350
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:52,730
did it take for the comments to actually

351
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,949
load right so we could put a little code

352
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:58,519
block around our Ajax and say how often

353
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,290
you know what are the real people on

354
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,350
outside all over the world firstly let's

355
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,850
look at where they are let's look at

356
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,399
what CDN they're using if any how often

357
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,720
do the comments load how often do they

358
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,029
fail because often we don't know this

359
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:14,959
stuff and this is this is how you do it

360
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,789
it's actually super simple you can make

361
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,919
a mock in your timeline by using window

362
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,589
performance mark in this example I've

363
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,709
labeled it foo then you can go and say

364
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,779
get entries by type mark and suddenly

365
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:28,160
you've got custom metrics that have

366
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,649
recorded using these nano times that the

367
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:33,139
performance api's give you and then

368
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,399
another really interesting part of that

369
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,730
is you can measure something so you

370
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,790
can say the sidebar initialization in

371
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,160
the time from Dom complete until in your

372
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,500
JavaScript code when your magic sidebar

373
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,170
unit code loaded it took this much time

374
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,790
and again you can track it and send it

375
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:54,420
back again google chrome team who seem

376
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,550
to do a lot of the performance work that

377
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,570
we see online have a metric actually

378
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,920
smell google chrome technically its web

379
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,110
page test so web page test is a project

380
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,529
that's sponsored by google and and they

381
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:10,110
use the idea of visually complete and so

382
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,310
they go and get your site and they get a

383
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,839
video and they record the whole thing

384
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,449
and then they break it up into

385
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,920
increments here it's showing second by

386
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,839
second but they actually break it into

387
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,610
increments of 100 milliseconds and they

388
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,980
get they actually diff the images and

389
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,779
they figure out at what point your site

390
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,550
was visually complete and I think this

391
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,899
is a really interesting metric because

392
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,149
it's actually when somebody will start

393
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:36,870
interacting with your page people wait

394
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,089
for things and you can you can actually

395
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,120
see this in action on facebook anyone

396
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,430
who uses facebook have you ever noticed

397
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,050
we're on your timeline feed it shows a

398
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,329
box and some lines and it kind of looks

399
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:51,029
like the post is there it draws your eye

400
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:52,500
straight away the side bars are still

401
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,350
loading but you actually draw into the

402
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,880
timeline and then suddenly the posts

403
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,050
appear it's actually really interesting

404
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,149
thing when they launched thought I

405
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,440
noticed that I was engaging with the

406
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,530
page sooner and i think that the study

407
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,970
that they're they're doing there is is

408
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,220
really interesting and I think this is

409
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,679
the most interesting performance metric

410
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,449
that we have is when will somebody start

411
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,819
interacting with your page and using the

412
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,169
performance api's that i've shown you

413
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,660
you can actually go and say hey when was

414
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,500
the first time that somebody actually

415
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,929
clicked on the page when did they

416
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:23,280
actually interact with something or

417
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,610
select some text once to mention a

418
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,549
couple of radical tools firstly you

419
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,020
could use pinga more New Relic they seem

420
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,230
to be about the same product essentially

421
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,880
I think they're kind of copying each

422
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,260
other I don't know if anyone works for

423
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,080
them sorry they're about the same you

424
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,909
can you can get your average load times

425
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:47,220
you can you know breakdown by action you

426
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,110
can break down by geographical region

427
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,880
etc

428
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,620
and also I wanted to shout out for four

429
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,380
atoms tool and brents CSS that's where

430
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,590
you can throw heaps of CSS at this thing

431
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,570
and it'll tell you the statistics and

432
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,700
characteristics of your styles so it'll

433
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,890
give you a little graph this is one of

434
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,950
my phrase I think its new is the

435
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,690
specificity graph which was first coined

436
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,789
I think by Harry Roberts maybe yep yep

437
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:20,730
that's great cool as far as far as we

438
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,429
know anyway shout out to Harry as well

439
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:25,380
and I definitely encourage that you go

440
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,000
and throw your CSS at this and

441
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,380
understand some metrics and numbers

442
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,789
because metrics and numbers allow you to

443
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,130
talk with your team and figure out what

444
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,720
you just did and what you should maybe

445
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,970
do next and also setting up and

446
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,620
installing all of these new tools or

447
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,899
like using new services every time for

448
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:44,309
every new project can be really tedious

449
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,220
and I kind of agree with that too so for

450
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,659
the last year or so I've been working on

451
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:51,179
an app called caliber its caliber opcom

452
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:56,190
and I track your site every day or when

453
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,070
you hit it with an API I record videos I

454
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,409
keep screenshots I get every metric that

455
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:03,000
I can possibly get out of chrome

456
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,830
devtools actually Rome run chrome

457
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,330
headless and I record it all for you and

458
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,409
that's been a really interesting project

459
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:13,080
for me and love to love to get your

460
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,610
feedback or see what you what you think

461
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,070
about it here's a couple of quick

462
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,390
takeaways one is your work set budgets

463
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,919
and make sure that you talk about them

464
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,169
on a regular basis because this is what

465
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:27,299
you're judged on for quality as a

466
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,600
developer and don't rely on what you

467
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,909
think you know actually go and prove it

468
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:36,990
thank you
