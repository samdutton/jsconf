[Music]

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,470
hi everyone thank you for having me

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,080
my name is Olivia Jack my talk is

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,689
entitled the browser as a modular

5
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,109
networked video synthesizer hopefully by

6
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,140
the end of the talk it'll be clear or

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,559
more clear what I mean by that

8
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,940
everything I'm gonna be talking about is

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,500
online at this website Hydra editor

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,120
glitch taught me and it's sort of an

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,270
ongoing set of research and

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,460
experimentation and creation that I've

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,100
been I've been working on for the last

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,390
year and a half and so Hydra is it's an

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,309
investigation of collaboration in the

16
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,280
creation of live visuals possibilities

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,030
of peer-to-peer technology on the web

18
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,460
feedback loops and it's also a platform

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,530
for live coding visuals in in JavaScript

20
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,880
and so one of the inspirations for this

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,729
this project is a project from 1977

22
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,700
called the satellite arts project by

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,020
Kate Galloway and Cher Shari Rabinowitz

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,090
and in the 70s they got access to a

25
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,340
satellite and were able to stream video

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,420
live between two places at once and this

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,369
is in the 70s you know before the

28
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,210
internet before Skype and and they

29
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,100
started experimenting with this just

30
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,119
sort of streaming video and putting

31
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:52,290
images on top of each other

32
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,100
mixing them together overlaying them and

33
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,079
and seeing what what happened when they

34
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,680
started experimenting with this and one

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,750
of the things they talked about with

36
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,299
their project is this marks the first

37
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,429
time that the geographically dispersed

38
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,220
electronic image was conduct

39
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,170
contextualized as a live immersive place

40
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,540
we're artists and others could convene

41
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,980
and co-create together

42
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,380
on a scale that could be as culturally

43
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,340
inclusive as desired and I want to focus

44
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,390
on the live immersive place piece of

45
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,400
this because I think all they're doing

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,350
they're sending data between two places

47
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,900
right and they're talking about how just

48
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,940
by putting these two images on top of

49
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,090
each other and seeing them live that

50
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,770
it's creating this space that's not

51
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,810
there and it's not there it's sort of

52
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,480
some third third space that's a

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,500
combination of these two spaces and I

54
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,220
think now with the web we talk about we

55
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,739
use this kind of metaphor of a place a

56
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,880
lot like a website it's a site it has an

57
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,570
address you go to the address you're at

58
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,440
the website and it might just seem kind

59
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,980
of like nitpicky but it's also it's it's

60
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,720
kind of talking about a way that we're

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,709
engaging with these technologies and and

62
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,630
but what's really happening when I go to

63
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,640
a website you know my my computer is

64
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,489
sending a message to a server somewhere

65
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,130
the server is responding with with a

66
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,250
message and so I'm not anywhere when I

67
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,410
go to a web site but but we have these

68
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,340
sort of ideas about how we talk about

69
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,410
the web and how we talk about how we

70
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,510
engage with the web that to me it's just

71
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,489
sort of interesting to be aware of them

72
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,390
and start to dissect them and especially

73
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,060
just in the 70s this was like wow what

74
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,880
do you mean we can see live video from

75
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,430
two different places at once and what

76
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,170
what are the possibilities of this and I

77
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,299
think sometimes when when technology

78
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,870
just comes out is when people are often

79
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,190
the most experimental with it and so

80
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,780
fast forward to now there's this

81
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,880
protocol called web RTC real-time web

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,440
streaming that lets you to browser

83
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,239
protocol for streaming video audio and

84
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,880
data directly between clients and so

85
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,450
what's in one of the interesting

86
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,910
WebRTC is that although you need a

87
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,840
signaling server to sort of set up

88
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,420
initial handshakes between clients once

89
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,610
clients are connected they're basically

90
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,290
just sending video or audio or data

91
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,530
between one another and about four or

92
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,880
five years ago I started experimenting

93
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,390
with this this protocol making sort of

94
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,100
little video chat applications and it

95
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,800
sort of was just kind of amazed that

96
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,790
it's not that hard in JavaScript to like

97
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:06,500
send video everywhere and so so I'm

98
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,000
still kind of interested in this

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,310
protocol and I think lately there's been

100
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,230
a lot of exciting developments with this

101
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,940
such as web torrent like BitTorrent

102
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,540
running on the web or Beeker browser and

103
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,300
different sort of peer-to-peer

104
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,770
peer-to-peer applications of this is

105
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,840
saying what happens if we don't

106
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,780
necessarily depend on a server for

107
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,330
everything or on honest on

108
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,560
centralization for everything and so so

109
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,290
this this diagram kind of gets thrown

110
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,150
around a lot but on the left is like a

111
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,450
really centralized network and towards

112
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,090
the middle a more decentralized network

113
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,610
and on the right a more distributed

114
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,780
network and one thing that WebRTC

115
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,170
enables is possibly more things like on

116
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,010
the right but one thing that's been sort

117
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,400
of interesting to me is seeing a lot of

118
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,100
peer-to-peer technology that often

119
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:12,200
although it's use it it's it has the

120
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,210
opportunity to connect people like the

121
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,890
diagram on the right often what happens

122
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,650
is sort of replicating a centralized

123
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,960
database such as with Bitcoin or

124
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,750
something you're you're creating a

125
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,420
centralized database of transactions and

126
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,140
so everyone still sort of receives the

127
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,000
same information and in some ways it's

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,710
recreating the experience of a

129
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,550
centralized database and so

130
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,530
experimenting with this video streaming

131
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,840
I got interested in sort of different

132
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,470
ways of of thinking of using this kind

133
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,000
of client-side peer-to-peer network and

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,289
so one of the things that really

135
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,319
inspired me sending video around the

136
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,050
Internet is analog video synthesizers

137
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,800
and so what's an analog video

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,889
synthesizer this is an example also from

139
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,370
the 70s it's the Sandin image processor

140
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,880
created in 1971 by Daniel Sandin and

141
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,220
basically each of these boxes either

142
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,729
generates a series of electrical signals

143
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,099
or transforms a series of electrical

144
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,349
signals and when the when the signal

145
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:24,830
gets to the screen it creates a pattern

146
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,710
and then the order in which you connect

147
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,370
the boxes sort of creates different

148
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,180
possibilities for modifying and changing

149
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,039
the image and so what I was interested

150
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,060
in is is kind of I sort of seeing

151
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,370
similarities between this thing where we

152
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,740
can send lots of video streams around

153
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,169
and this thing over here which is

154
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,780
sending lots of signals around and the

155
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,779
way and the order in which which we're

156
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,610
sending them can create different

157
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,279
creative possibilities and this is

158
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,050
really I had no like specific goal in

159
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,490
mind but this is sort of like oh I just

160
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,449
want to play with these web protocols

161
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,699
and and it's not in this case not really

162
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,699
thinking of a website as a place or a

163
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,830
site but thinking of it as a flow of

164
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,740
information in this case sort of a

165
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,509
signal flow and so so this is sort of

166
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:23,539
was like an initial experiment that I

167
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:27,620
did with this which is basically here I

168
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,500
have a bunch of windows connected via

169
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,950
web RTC in this case they're all on the

170
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,050
same computer but they could easily have

171
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,300
been you know one in one country one in

172
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,010
a different country connected over the

173
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:46,040
web and here on the Left I'm creating an

174
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,920
image and I'm sending it as a video

175
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,350
to here and combining it with this one

176
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:57,079
and then I'm sending other videos here's

177
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,329
the webcam and then combining it with

178
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:03,230
what's on the bottom right and again I

179
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,029
would just sort of started explaining

180
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:07,490
around with these things and as I didn't

181
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,820
exactly know what my goals were with it

182
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,070
I started live coding in the console

183
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,500
just to sort of experiment and be able

184
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,510
to live change change these these things

185
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,620
and it's sort of like it's both a visual

186
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,839
experiment but also sort of a conceptual

187
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,060
experiment of what happens if we connect

188
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,089
in these ways and how can we maybe

189
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:35,420
collaborate or something so so this is

190
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,290
an initial experiment and then it turns

191
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,560
out it's not that practical all the time

192
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,480
if you're on the same computer to be

193
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,450
sending video streams

194
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,670
it's like takes a lot of processing

195
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,200
power if you're if you're just on the

196
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,640
same computer and so this experiment led

197
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,760
to a node module called RTC patch Bay

198
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,839
that just for me made it easy to to send

199
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,589
these video streams and sort of reroute

200
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,040
them and then I started making this sort

201
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,350
of in browser editor to play with this

202
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,939
and I'm gonna go to right now let's see

203
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:28,160
so and so this this platform is called

204
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,899
called Hydra that I've been working on

205
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,000
it lets you send video streams to other

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,130
people who are connected but it also

207
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,230
lets you kind of play with this way of

208
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,899
making images directly within the

209
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,269
browser and so I'm gonna actually clear

210
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:51,410
the canvas right now and so drawing from

211
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,540
analog synthesizer world one of the

212
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,240
basic things that you can make in Hydra

213
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,660
is an oscillator but then when you just

214
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,550
write oscillator you don't actually see

215
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,910
an

216
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,790
and so then to connect it to actually

217
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,020
see it you have to connect it to an

218
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:11,390
output and so when a and I'm doing

219
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,400
control enter to execute this code and

220
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,020
so here I have an oscillator and I'm

221
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,180
connecting it to an output and I sort of

222
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,720
use functions to correspond to this idea

223
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,810
of the analog modular synthesizer and

224
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,360
then chaining the functions as sort of

225
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,950
the patch cables connecting the

226
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,050
different pieces of of the analog

227
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,210
modular synthesizer and then the

228
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,450
parameters here can correspond sort of

229
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,570
like turning the knobs of of the analog

230
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,770
synthesizer where I can change change

231
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:49,160
certain parameters and so here here I'm

232
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,190
I'm changing the frequency of the

233
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,290
oscillator how fast it's moving and how

234
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,590
separated the colors are and then I can

235
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,420
add more more chained functions onto

236
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,170
this more transformations of the signal

237
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,020
suits similar to the boxes and the

238
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,160
modular synthesizer and so I can keep

239
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,460
adding there's oscillator rotate and now

240
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:24,310
I could add a kaleidoscope change them

241
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:30,650
repeat the kaleidoscope and so one of

242
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,470
the things also for with this that's

243
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,760
interesting to me is it's it's sort of a

244
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,420
lot of the ways that we make graphics on

245
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,400
the computer use also different

246
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,180
analogies for example canvas it's like

247
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,950
the idea that you have a canvas and

248
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,920
you're drawing things onto the canvas or

249
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,440
using Microsoft Word or something it's

250
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,060
the idea that you have a document and

251
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,430
you're you're typing text onto it and

252
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,010
all of these analogies kind of create a

253
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,350
framework for thinking about making

254
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,110
things using the computer and so instead

255
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,530
of using either the idea of a canvas

256
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,400
where you're drawing shapes or using a

257
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,000
3d rendering thing

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,280
3G is where you have a camera and a mesh

259
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,910
and lights and all this stuff here and

260
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,420
really interested in this idea of signal

261
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,350
flow and using signal flow as a way to

262
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:35,610
to create images and all of this this

263
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:41,550
each function corresponds to a GLSL

264
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,340
shaders function and a shader is a

265
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,290
program that runs on the graphics card

266
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,770
and it basically is given a coordinate

267
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,750
and outputs a color and it's sort of

268
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,910
most basic sense and so so I'll each

269
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,690
each of these functions either

270
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,840
transforms a coordinate to a color

271
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,580
transforms the color or transforms a

272
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,890
coordinate space and then adding them

273
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,350
together kind of lets you experiment

274
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,820
with these things and of course the

275
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,560
order that things are in matters so like

276
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
if I put another rotate here then gonna

277
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,110
start rotating afterwards and I can also

278
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,120
instead of using an oscillator as a

279
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,640
source I could use for any of them for

280
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,610
example I could use a camera as a source

281
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:49,900
[Music]

282
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:55,710
dark but that's all of you and so I

283
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:02,390
could I can also sort of apply apply

284
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:08,890
transformations to this so let's see

285
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,510
yeah it's a little it's a little darker

286
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,460
I'm gonna switch to my camera so we will

287
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:22,359
see better there we go

288
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:29,339
apply transformations and so now we just

289
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,850
sort of have one source and one output

290
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,769
I've shown you and I could I could

291
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,629
execute different code to sort of switch

292
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:39,839
back between the two but we thought the

293
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,579
whole analog synthesizer there's all

294
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,170
these options for like patching things

295
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,249
into each other and so so in this system

296
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:48,899
in order to be able to do that I

297
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,899
actually have four sort of virtual

298
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,160
outputs with which with different names

299
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,679
and so I could send the oscillator

300
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,769
instead of to the first screen I could

301
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,269
send it to the second screen which in

302
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:07,230
this case has a name oh one and I'm

303
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,410
gonna simplify this a little here so so

304
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,799
here I'm sending the camera to the to

305
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,189
the first output zero and I'm sending

306
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:21,059
the oscillator to the second output and

307
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:23,149
then what I could do is actually blend

308
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,110
blend these together so I could take

309
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,179
zero and blend it with a one and send it

310
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:41,610
out - OH - here and so here I'm blending

311
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,129
the two together and if I change one of

312
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,249
them it changes all of them again this

313
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,559
is all running directly on the graphics

314
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,779
card with through WebGL and shaders and

315
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,110
and if you're familiar with Photoshop or

316
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,619
video editing software there's different

317
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,990
ways of compositing pixels together so

318
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,659
here I'm taking the difference between

319
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,850
the colors if you think of each color as

320
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,389
a number between zero and one RGB

321
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:14,730
channels and then you can do different

322
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,959
sort of arithmetic but then another

323
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,059
thing that I borrowed from analog

324
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,329
synthesizer is not just combining colors

325
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,100
together but it's actually using the

326
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,159
colors of one thing to affect the

327
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:31,860
coordinates of another thing and so here

328
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,910
um here it's using the oscillator to

329
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:44,520
sort of warp the initial image and this

330
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,799
I'm all doing this sort of in separate

331
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,730
function changes but I could also do it

332
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,390
all all sort of together and so I could

333
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,920
just here say I'm gonna take this and

334
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,850
modulate it with an oscillator I'll just

335
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,309
show here and I could I don't know

336
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,230
put another oscillator on top here and

337
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,900
just keep keep kind of chained chaining

338
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,150
all these things together and it creates

339
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,240
really complicated patterns really

340
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,669
quickly and this this is just really fun

341
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:31,260
for me and then so using different Web

342
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,470
API is also you can not just use the

343
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,150
camera as an as an input but also lots

344
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,130
of other things oh and this is one of

345
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,020
the things that dance and and said about

346
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,600
this Sandin image processor in the

347
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,520
seventies is the modules are designed to

348
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,990
maximize the possibility of

349
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,059
interconnection thereby maximizing the

350
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,890
number of possible modifications of the

351
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,620
image so that's like when I'm thinking

352
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,510
about the functions that are there it's

353
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,320
how can these functions really maximize

354
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,059
the possibilities of the way that you

355
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,460
can you can mix them together and so

356
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,590
this is using the screen itself as an

357
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,510
input these are sort of experiments that

358
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,880
I've done using this this idea of the

359
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,580
video synthesizer this is using my

360
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,530
Twitter feed as an input using the

361
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,309
desktop capture API you can use any

362
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:24,179
window as an input this is using Google

363
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,260
Maps as a as an input and sort of

364
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:34,440
experimenting with it and this is using

365
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,140
a live stream of an aquarium and a live

366
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,620
stream of a Time Square and then live

367
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,920
coding them together and and this

368
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,710
sort of going back to the the satellite

369
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,800
arts project of just sort of combining

370
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,590
two live things and what are what kind

371
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,170
of possibilities or ideas about those

372
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,050
two spaces or arise by putting them on

373
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:11,350
top of each other and so another thing

374
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,970
that when it clear this here that is

375
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,220
really exciting for me to experiment

376
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,000
what this is is video feedback or sort

377
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,030
of using the output of something as the

378
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,080
input to itself or in other words sort

379
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:45,960
of recursion and so here so here here's

380
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,610
the camera I'm actually gonna switch

381
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:57,850
cameras here to the other one and so so

382
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,530
the basics of video feedback is just

383
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,480
pointing a camera at its own screen and

384
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,620
sometimes it can create really

385
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,440
complicated things but when I'm holding

386
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,930
a camera here it's not very precise and

387
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,210
so I could actually just do it sort of

388
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,000
within the code so for example I could

389
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,420
here make a shape and then I could blend

390
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:28,060
it with its own output which is oa0 in

391
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,520
this case but because it's blending the

392
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,290
same thing with the same thing it just

393
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:37,600
ends up also being a triangle but if I

394
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,580
blend it with itself and then repeat the

395
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,910
entire thing add a shape on top to the

396
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,710
repeated output it gets more interesting

397
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:53,920
and so we get sort of a fractal which is

398
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,950
a form that repeats itself a different

399
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,400
scale

400
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,670
and so just using this idea of a video

401
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,080
feedback and in pretty simple code then

402
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,840
you get something that's as complex

403
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,120
account as complex as a factor and so

404
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,220
another example is here I could go back

405
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:24,400
to the camera and they're actually

406
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:35,440
another example oh yeah and so I could

407
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,820
blend my face with itself here we go and

408
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,830
so then I just start to get these sort

409
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,760
of trails but then if I use that

410
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,010
modulate function again and so I

411
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,190
actually use the colors to affect the

412
00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:02,860
coordinates and so each frame update I'm

413
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,860
sort of using the colors that were there

414
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,600
to to affect the coordinates and and

415
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,490
because of feedback it ends up being

416
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,410
this sort of liquid effect and it turns

417
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,330
out this is kind of similar to how fluid

418
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:22,840
dynamics or exceeds textures to to talk

419
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,610
about pressures and velocities and so

420
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,470
this is exciting to me because it's sort

421
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,770
of the code isn't that complicated but

422
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,320
these things that are supposedly

423
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,970
computational really computationally

424
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,520
complicated like navier's stokes fluid

425
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,650
dynamics and stuff maybe we could have

426
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,720
sort of an intuitive understanding of

427
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,400
them by thinking about them in sort of a

428
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:52,780
different way and so it closed in my

429
00:23:52,780 --> 00:24:00,800
slides

430
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,050
oh yeah you could also use like a canvas

431
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,180
as a as an input which is kind of fun

432
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,370
and yeah I've just kept playing around

433
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,450
with this this sort of this thing or

434
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,330
this is reaction diffusion made using

435
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,320
using feedback and this is one of the

436
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,050
things that dance and it said in the 70s

437
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,910
about the idea of the feedback loop is

438
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,980
put yourself in a feedback loop yes the

439
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,420
reason you put yourself in a feedback

440
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,920
loop is so you can learn something or

441
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,870
rather learn to do something you know

442
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,340
you do something in the results get

443
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,930
processed somehow perhaps just by

444
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,000
yourself just looking at it and you do

445
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,830
another thing in the results of that get

446
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,110
processed and your action can constantly

447
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,480
be tuned or corrected or refined by what

448
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,930
you see and so this has been interesting

449
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,520
to me because although I've built this

450
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,970
software from from basically scratch

451
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,490
like there's almost no using no

452
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,940
libraries and stuff but I still don't

453
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,070
know what's gonna happen and having the

454
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,620
editor there and being able to change it

455
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,200
in real time and see the results is sort

456
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,600
of really resonates with me both as an

457
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,120
artistic process as well as a process

458
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,440
for developing code and just sort of

459
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,350
investigation as well and so also one of

460
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,600
the things they've done is made a

461
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,890
Twitter bot where you can you can post a

462
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,560
sketch to the Twitter ah and there's

463
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,370
actually an anyone who's different

464
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,440
people who've been using the editor can

465
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,080
can post something here and then if you

466
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,300
actually click click on on it in the

467
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,360
Twitter bot it directly opens the code

468
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,860
and so then you can edit directly edit

469
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,760
the code here and so here I'm editing

470
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,160
this I got a little fast and then I can

471
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,850
upload it again and here let's say J s

472
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,750
conf Asia

473
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:14,000
and then upload it and we'll see if it

474
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:25,260
shows up here but yep that goes so it

475
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,240
and so it shows us what we just did but

476
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,909
it also shows the sketch that it was

477
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:34,159
sort of based on here and that this one

478
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,289
was based on one earlier and it's

479
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,150
thinking about like oh we're all just

480
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,580
kind of exploring the possibilities of

481
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:47,000
this the game almost out of time yeah

482
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,530
but I wanted to just quickly mention

483
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,340
this idea of live coding so I've started

484
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,590
I live code visuals with this so

485
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,570
sometimes in clubs or in different

486
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,450
events with experimental music and I

487
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,020
make a write code live to make visuals

488
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,809
and this is there's another people all

489
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:06,890
over the world doing this using

490
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,390
different languages and sort of

491
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,630
experimenting with ways of programming

492
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,820
and sort of showing the code while there

493
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,950
while they're performing in this there's

494
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,100
this language called tidal cycles that's

495
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,370
for making music and as somewhat similar

496
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,640
ideas as Hydra for making visuals in

497
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,240
that although it's in in Haskell but

498
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,830
everything that you write in title is

499
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,770
sort of a transformation of a pattern in

500
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,270
time and using that you can make music

501
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,809
so yeah we have a live coding group in

502
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:44,900
Bogota there's little groups all over

503
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,000
the world there's one in India and I'm

504
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,350
meeting with some people in Indonesia

505
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,010
next week insects

506
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,039
this is last week in Bogota using title

507
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,519
to make music

508
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,519
Haeju to make business anyways thank you

509
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,440
so much
