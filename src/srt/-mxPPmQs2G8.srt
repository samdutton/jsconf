10
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,970
my name is Ruth I'm from the UK I'm also

11
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,160
here with my milk collective which is

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
over in the corner there which is life -

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,640
I think the web platform is a really

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,930
really interesting platform for making

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,090
art it's because of its openness its

16
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,940
ease of use its consumer ability by

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,180
everybody its connectivity like the web

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,550
is everywhere and for everybody which i

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,000
think is exactly what artists

23
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,640
so my talk was about maintaining bowel

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,700
and it was kind of just like my story of

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,260
how I got involved in the project and

26
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,810
then kind of like I shared a few stories

27
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,400
about what it's like to be a maintainer

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,680
keep the internet weird is a talk that

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,170
I'm giving to let people know that there

30
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,360
are communities available now that we

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,520
have that will be able to help you

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,710
foster that kind of growth and feeling

33
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,590
of inclusivity and code exploration and

34
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,200
that you just have to know where to find

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,959
them my talk was about compression and

36
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,330
were specifically about HTTP compression

37
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,050
so I was talking about being able to

38
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,820
kind of compress out your bundles before

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,020
you serve them up

40
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:40,750

41
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,720
I saw this tweet earlier that kind of

42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,180
summarizes really well whose was the Jay

43
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,500
s come for you feels more like a

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,200
festival than maybe the classical tech

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,970
conference and I think this is really

46
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,409
really nice to see because that's kind

47
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:55,930
of what we were trying to do I think

48
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,489
technology and the tech industry can be

49
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,890
only about engineering and frameworks we

50
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,780
really have to focus on the human aspect

51
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,760
of it and that's why we will never stop

52
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,650
having the stocks and we will never

53
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,810
never stop challenging the industry in

54
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,970
the way we do and that upsets some

55
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,859
people but I think that's good because

56
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,079
that creates a certain discomfort and

57
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:16,500
that drives change
