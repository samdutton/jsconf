00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,460
hello excellent I do have a loud voice

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,930
so it probably doesn't really matter if

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,430
I have a microphone or not but anyway

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,580
this is probably better so that was a

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,080
really great introduction so I can just

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,489
skip all the stuff about me this is last

8
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,530
year I attended jazz con for ages so

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,790
it's really cool to actually be standing

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,180
on stage this time but what I'm gonna do

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,710
is jump right in and tell you about the

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,850
talk today I'm going to talk about

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,760
variable fonts we're gonna do a quick

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,559
explanation of what they are for

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,020
everyone that doesn't know I will very

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,750
very briefly touch on performance and

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,800
then we'll just look at some ways that

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
you can implement them to do some

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,750
practical things but my favorite demos

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,250
are the ones that are a bit fun so

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,789
there's quite a few of those so what's

22
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,470
important to know is that I'm a

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,250
developer I love to design that looks

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,280
really terrible but oh well hopefully oh

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,299
wow it looks so pixelated that's so sad

26
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,240
okay well I guess we'll just have to

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,939
live with that so I started creating

28
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,470
text effects like a couple of years ago

29
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,860
and during my experiments I started

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,299
playing with variable fonts and it

31
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,700
became really clear to me very quickly

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,320
that they offer a lot of unique

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,390
opportunities that standard fonts just

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,710
can't provide us so the reason for that

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,890
is that mobile fonts are basically one

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,689
font file that acts like multiple fonts

37
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,210
and that's basically the crux of what

38
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,340
they are and what that means is that

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,220
where we might have normally had maybe

40
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,649
six different font styles as separate

41
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,320
individual files you can now have all of

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,450
that information in the one file instead

43
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,860
that looks not too bad so that's good

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,500
the way this is achieved all comes down

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,420
to the way that the font itself is

46
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,540
created so a variable font can have one

47
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,150
or more

48
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,579
maxi's and what they do is provide

49
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,349
different variations between different

50
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:20,200
extremes so in this case we have a light

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,640
- a bold weight

52
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,790
now along that axis you can have named

53
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,790
instances like regular and bold which is

54
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,439
things that we're used to seeing in our

55
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,500
code on the web but you also gain the

56
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,370
ability to interpolate between those

57
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,280
values and this allows for intermediate

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,829
designs providing much finer control

59
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,950
over the font itself so along with those

60
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,230
standard values you can have everything

61
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,310
in between as well like I don't know 207

62
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,970
and that includes decimal places and

63
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,709
because the axis is interpolated it

64
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,870
means that we can animate between the

65
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,280
values creating really smooth

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,849
transitions between the variations but

67
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:06,099
we're not just limited to a single axis

68
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,019
at a time a variable font can contain

69
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,920
thousands of axes and what you get out

70
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,079
of this is the interpolation isn't just

71
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,209
applied to one axis at a time it's

72
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,799
applied to the combinations of those

73
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:18,910
axes as well

74
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,599
so if you wanted to have a wide heavy

75
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,569
font or a really narrow thin font you

76
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,889
can have that all within the one file so

77
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,260
in essence a variable font gives us a

78
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,419
single file with a greater amount of

79
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,669
variation and a significant increase in

80
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:39,159
style choices and they don't just have

81
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,199
to be standard things like font weight

82
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,690
or width it can be something totally

83
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,180
different or a little bit weird like

84
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,430
deco bar this is probably my favorite

85
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,000
font it's by a designer called David

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,519
bellow it's the first one that I ever

87
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,620
played with and it has a lot of

88
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,659
different creative axes in it that you

89
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,129
can do awesome things with then we'll

90
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,940
have a look at some demos later now the

91
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,190
way that we use variable fonts is really

92
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,900
similar to how we would normally use

93
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,069
fonts on the web for the most part we

94
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,870
set it up exactly the same way as we

95
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,970
normally would in our CSS using font

96
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,880
face the main difference is how we

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,130
define variations for descriptors like

98
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,710
font weight font stretch and font style

99
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,350
so in this example

100
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,150
might have previously set a font face

101
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,430
block for the light version and then we

102
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,470
do another one for the bold version and

103
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,200
so on until we'd hit all of our styles

104
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,310
but with variable fonts you don't need

105
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,440
to do that you can simply define a range

106
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,420
for the font weight so in this case I'm

107
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,670
going to hundred to 700 and then from

108
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,400
here when we reference it in our CSS we

109
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,810
do it exactly the same way that we

110
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,610
normally would but instead of being

111
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,750
limited to values like bold or 700 you

112
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,810
can pick any number between 200 and 700

113
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,070
like 658 now this is really really good

114
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,900
for something like weight because we've

115
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,630
already got a CSS property that we can

116
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,780
use in the land of variable fonts this

117
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,970
is known as a registered axis and all

118
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,290
that means is that it's been

119
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,960
standardized in the spec at the moment

120
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,270
there are five registered axes weight

121
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,170
with slant italic and optical sized and

122
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,690
they're all matched to preexisting CSS

123
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,000
properties but if you want to use

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,950
something more custom like the deck of

125
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,840
our examples we're going to need a new

126
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,330
CSS property and that's called font

127
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,030
variation settings now this is an

128
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,550
example of a font that I have invented

129
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,280
called my jello font jello is the name

130
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,200
of my dog he does feature in this

131
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,140
presentation so look out he's very cute

132
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,500
and in font variation settings you can

133
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,870
define as many registered or custom axes

134
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,480
as you want so here I have two custom

135
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,460
axes one is called jello and one is

136
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,560
called fellow and they both have an

137
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,680
Associated number value custom access

138
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,870
codes are defined by the font creator

139
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,150
inside the font and they're always four

140
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,550
characters whereas a registered axis

141
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,480
that's defined in the spec now as I said

142
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,460
you can use registered axes in front

143
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,620
variation settings however it is

144
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,390
strongly recommended that you use their

145
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,730
map CSS property instead so we like font

146
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,370
weight and the reason for this is it's

147
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,740
not really this is kind of like a backup

148
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,140
if the axis doesn't exist because

149
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,270
there's a lot of custom stuff but to be

150
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,580
honest it's way easier to manage your

151
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,440
typography if you use the map properties

152
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,850
when you can anyway and I'm sure people

153
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,240
one

154
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,919
about browser support it's actually

155
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,569
really really good

156
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,850
ie doesn't support it but that's not

157
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,740
unexpected they're not developing that

158
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,190
anymore

159
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,229
so you know it's fair the only caveat to

160
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,050
this browser support is you do need more

161
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,169
modern operating systems so on Mac I

162
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,210
believe it's high sierra some of the

163
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,569
browser's rely on the operating system

164
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:08,199
versions in order to for it to render if

165
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,910
you are worried about browser support

166
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,560
and you have to support ie still which a

167
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,550
lot of us do you can use the CSS feature

168
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,130
detection to detect for support of font

169
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,560
variation settings and then you can fall

170
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,060
back to a standard font if variable

171
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,590
fonts are not supported so there are

172
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,110
options there for us if we need to

173
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,430
support it in browsers that don't

174
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,409
currently support variable fonts but to

175
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,120
be honest it's pretty good and you're

176
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,590
probably going to get away with it I'm

177
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:41,199
using them for most use cases so as I

178
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,300
said earlier I did want to briefly talk

179
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,099
about performance because it's a

180
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:46,690
question people often ask there's a

181
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,310
whole lot of stuff around web font

182
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,759
performance that can impact this I'm not

183
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,370
gonna go into it because that's like 40

184
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,289
minutes of a talk on its own but

185
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:57,909
essentially everything that you apply to

186
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:00,400
web fonts on the web now also apply to

187
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,440
variable fonts but there are a couple of

188
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,180
things that I wanted to specifically

189
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,650
mention because I get asked about it a

190
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,139
lot the first one is the number of font

191
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,150
requests and the second one is font file

192
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,800
size so often when we think about

193
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,120
reducing the number of font requests to

194
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,099
improve our font performance it means

195
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,780
that we would plan our typography

196
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,520
choices and we'd weigh up the cost of

197
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,889
design over the cost of performance and

198
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:26,409
this is why we have that rule where you

199
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:28,270
can only have like three fonts in your

200
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,050
website that's an employee's limitation

201
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,750
because of things like performance but

202
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,789
because variable fonts can contain all

203
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,279
that information in one file that means

204
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,140
we've immediately reduced the number of

205
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,209
font requests simply by using a variable

206
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:48,279
font however if all of that information

207
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,940
now exists in one file instead of three

208
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,600
what's that going to do to file size

209
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,890
so that brings me to file sizes you'd be

210
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,810
right in assuming that a variable phone

211
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,820
is going to be larger than a standard

212
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,060
font typically not always but typically

213
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,220
so I want to give you a bit of a

214
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,650
comparison I'm gonna use source sans Pro

215
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,830
which is on github

216
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,840
the single weight of source sans Pro is

217
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,460
approximately two hundred and thirty

218
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,290
four kilobytes it varies a little bit

219
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,330
depending on the style but about that in

220
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,390
the OTF file version now if we use a

221
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,220
more efficient front weight format like

222
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,930
wofe two that will drop down to about

223
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,120
one hundred and eleven kilobytes that

224
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,740
still seems like a lot but keep in mind

225
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,480
that source hands have like lots of

226
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,040
language characters and stuff in it so

227
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,750
you can subset this to make them even

228
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,210
smaller I'm pretty sure when I subsetted

229
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,070
this to like English characters it came

230
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,470
down to sixteen so that is always an

231
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,180
option now the variable phone the ODF is

232
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,370
very large it's four hundred and five

233
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,890
kilobytes but the wolf 2 is only a

234
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,920
hundred and twelve which is only one

235
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,130
kilobyte more than a single weight and I

236
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,640
get a lot more options with that so to

237
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,440
me in this case if you're using

238
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,730
efficient font formats you get a lot

239
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,350
more design opportunity with very

240
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,460
minimal impact to performance but as I

241
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,110
alluded to this is obviously going to

242
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,440
depend on a font a font basis it's not

243
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,880
always going to be better to use a

244
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,530
variable font it's not always going to

245
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,150
be better to use a standard font so you

246
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,280
do need to do your research and check

247
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,250
this stuff out beforehand if anyone

248
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,450
wants to talk about parable font

249
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,010
performance come see me afterwards I

250
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,570
haven't done a presentation on it before

251
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,850
so we can have beautiful in-depth

252
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,150
discussions about it

253
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,460
so we talked about browser support we

254
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,020
kind of know what they are hopefully

255
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,160
talk about a little bit about

256
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,750
performance and how we can use them in

257
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,590
our CSS we're all across that with that

258
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,270
in mind now we can start to shift our

259
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,210
focus we no longer need to really trade

260
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,400
off design for performance in my opinion

261
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,840
variable fonts are a really great way to

262
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,480
move past that and we gained much more

263
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,420
flexibility in our design opportunities

264
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,530
designs which would have previously been

265
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,340
a really

266
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,160
burden on performance or impossible

267
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,870
because of technical limitations like

268
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,090
the font weights or whatever not

269
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,690
existing

270
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,870
they're now completely possible and we

271
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,730
can start to forget about a lot of the

272
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,830
perceived limitations and figure out how

273
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,600
we can use this technology to create

274
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,580
better or more interesting experiences

275
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,070
for our users and the tone and the

276
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,510
intent of our words can be more

277
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,030
effectively represented with less worry

278
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,250
over the impacts of loading in too many

279
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,360
font weights and more importantly and

280
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,330
this kind of goes towards the first

281
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,160
presentation is that we can start to

282
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,900
embrace the learnings and the growth of

283
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,390
print design I am gonna add here

284
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,010
the reason I'm not a designer is because

285
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,640
of stuff like this it's really ugly but

286
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,540
it's so cute so I've left it in that's

287
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,600
my dog's Instagram too by the way should

288
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,360
follow him he's very cute well unlike

289
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,340
print design right we can benefit from

290
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,930
the flexibility and the interactive

291
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,900
nature of the web because variable fonts

292
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,120
can have an interpolated range of values

293
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,610
we can create animations or transitions

294
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,950
with the text itself without relying on

295
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,460
things like SVG or canvas or you know

296
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,710
complex JavaScript stuff and we can

297
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,960
achieve these effects using techniques

298
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,970
we might already be familiar with like

299
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,940
CSS animations transitions or JavaScript

300
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,770
events like viewport resize scroll

301
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,930
position sensor API that kind of stuff

302
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,440
so what we gonna do now is we're gonna

303
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,360
look at how we can animate and interact

304
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,220
with variable fonts to create things

305
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,020
that are practical to use but also a

306
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,850
little bit fun and we're going to start

307
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,710
with that grass effect that I just

308
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,660
showed you so the grass or grow effect I

309
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,880
use a font called deco var which I

310
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,890
showed you earlier I'm going to use two

311
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,070
of its axes one is called inline and one

312
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,340
is called skeleton worm so this is what

313
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,100
inline looks like on its own it's kind

314
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,890
of like a hedge it's pretty nice I put

315
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,000
my clicker down I should've done that oh

316
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,100
yeah and this one is skeleton worm so we

317
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,200
add its maximum value of a thousand it's

318
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,330
like little novel things now when you

319
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,150
combine these two

320
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,680
that's how we get the leaves from the

321
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,320
effect so once we've set up that base

322
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,420
CSS with the font family and our two

323
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,020
axes we can create our animation now I'm

324
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,120
just going to use a keyframe animation

325
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,540
it's got starts at zero we set both

326
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,220
inline and skeleton worm to their

327
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,250
maximum values of a thousand at 50% we

328
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,530
set skeleton went back to zero and then

329
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,090
it's just going to loop back round and

330
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,350
what this will do is we'll start

331
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,360
expanded it'll disappear and then it'll

332
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,510
come back out again we add the animation

333
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,450
to our h1 it runs infinitely it's called

334
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,680
grow four seconds and that's it that's

335
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,170
how I made that all I did was add a

336
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,320
little bit of extra CSS for texture it's

337
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,090
a couple of tax shadows and a background

338
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,000
image for the most part the heavy

339
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,480
lifting is done by the font I'm a bit of

340
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,000
a lazy developer the least I can write

341
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,250
the better and variable fonts make this

342
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,460
stuff so easy because they've already

343
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,260
done all of the work for you in the font

344
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,140
itself so with just a little bit of CSS

345
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,620
you can make all sorts of things you can

346
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,800
do writing text this is a font by

347
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,700
underwear this one's Dec over again this

348
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,770
uses blend modes this is a simple one

349
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,600
using a hover state with transition

350
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,360
changing the weight as you hover over it

351
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,090
it's called gingham I don't really know

352
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,760
how to describe this one but it's cool

353
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,740
this is my favorite demo and the reason

354
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,060
that I love this demo it's a daiquiri

355
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,650
bar again daiquiri bar is like the best

356
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,170
font David bellow is the best what I

357
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,270
love about this is if you have a look at

358
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,800
it it's got a really long text shadow

359
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,390
applied to it but what it demonstrates

360
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,050
is that as you modify the variable font

361
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,180
the text shadow disappears with it

362
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,880
because we're actually changing the font

363
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,430
itself we're not just applying effects

364
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,260
over the top of it and I think that is a

365
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,120
really beautiful and perfect

366
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,620
demonstration of what makes variable

367
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,000
fonts so different but it's not just

368
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
that they're beautiful or they're cool

369
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,040
or any of that kind of stuff

370
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,690
what they demonstrate is that as

371
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,029
developers and designers we can control

372
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:39,550
the font itself and that means that

373
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,190
variable fonts allowed typography on the

374
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,290
web to adapt to the flexible nature of

375
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,089
our screens our environments and our

376
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,940
devices and there's currently a lot of

377
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,130
work being done with CSS media queries

378
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,500
the level 5 spec it's in draft at the

379
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,690
moment but it aims to give us control

380
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,940
over our designs based on environments

381
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,750
like contrast and color schemes and even

382
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,060
though it's in draft stages there's one

383
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,490
which I'm sure some of you know about

384
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,130
which we can play with called prefers

385
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,329
color scheme and dark mode I'm going to

386
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:16,209
show you a really cool example I've just

387
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,620
talked it up I hope you still think it's

388
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,649
cool anyway what I've got here I'm using

389
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,230
a font called Qi it's by owner type code

390
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,019
it's got a axis called temp I'm gonna

391
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,509
set that at 0 to start with mounting a

392
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:30,579
transition so you can see it animate for

393
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:34,029
demo purposes but then we use a media

394
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,829
query of prefer color scheme and we

395
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,690
check for dark and if it's in dark mode

396
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,069
I'm gonna change the access to a

397
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:42,029
thousand this is what it looks like

398
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:48,310
so as you switch to dark it oozes cuz

399
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:53,290
it's dark right and when it goes back to

400
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,389
light it goes back to the normal state

401
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,300
that looks so bad on that screen at

402
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,160
least it kind of works with the ooze but

403
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,929
sorry the interface is not great but we

404
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:07,179
can apply that kind of concept to our

405
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:09,010
typography to adjust all sorts of things

406
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,409
like screen widths and that might allow

407
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,770
us to change the font weight based on

408
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,120
whether the screen is larger or smaller

409
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,610
or other things like width and optical

410
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,970
size as well and where the viewport is

411
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,669
wide we might have more detail or it's

412
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,559
small line or more confined space we can

413
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,950
reduce the width of the font and we can

414
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,299
make the most of different JavaScript

415
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:34,419
events like resize scroll Mouse move and

416
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,690
we can create all kinds of interesting

417
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,190
storytelling and experiences on the web

418
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,020
I spent more time trying to figure out

419
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,280
what word to put in this and they did

420
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,730
writing the code for it to work I really

421
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,900
like this example

422
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,490
it's not everyone else's favorite but I

423
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,620
think it's great now the good thing

424
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,610
about these kinds of examples is that

425
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,230
once you have the formula for modifying

426
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,210
the font you can apply it to basically

427
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,460
anything and I'm going to show you what

428
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,560
that formula is so that you can go away

429
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,360
and you can make all sorts of fun things

430
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,270
with variable fonts so what we're going

431
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,850
to do is if the font if the viewport

432
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,000
size is big or small like as it changes

433
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,290
we're going to change the font weight as

434
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,000
a simple demonstration the problem is we

435
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,950
might have a font weight of say 200 to

436
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,800
900 and a viewport size of 320 pixels to

437
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,680
1440 pixels so we need to align these

438
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,840
two sets of values which are not only

439
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,760
different ranges but also different

440
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,760
measurements so what we're going to do

441
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,830
is start off with our minimum and

442
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,250
maximum access and event values which is

443
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,870
what these numbers are so two hundred

444
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,240
and nine hundred for the font and 320 to

445
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,230
1440 for the viewport it's basically

446
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,360
setting the start and end points so that

447
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,440
it doesn't just go on infinitely so now

448
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,580
that we've got our minimum or maximum

449
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,710
values we're going to get the current

450
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,210
viewport width so the current event

451
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,460
value and we can do that with something

452
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,300
like window in a width for example now

453
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,840
once we have that what we want to do is

454
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,730
change the pixel values to something

455
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,870
more useable so we're going to convert

456
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,320
it to a decimal place so what we do here

457
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,020
is we take the current size that we just

458
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,110
set with window don't inner width and

459
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,030
then we minus the minimum size of the

460
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,880
viewport and then we divide that by the

461
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,310
maximum minus the minimum and that's

462
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,650
going to give us a value between 0 and

463
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,100
0.99 which we can then use to determine

464
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,260
what our font weight is going to be so

465
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,960
we take that new decimal and we multiply

466
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,180
it by the minimum weight minus the

467
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,220
maximum weight and then we add the

468
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,850
maximum weight back on again what that's

469
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,800
going to do is give us a value between

470
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,990
200 to 900 based on the viewport size

471
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,210
then you can update the value in your

472
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,510
CSS however you normally would I'm using

473
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,930
CSS custom properties

474
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,210
I have a custom property called weight

475
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,690
so I'm basically saying update my custom

476
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,040
property of weight with my new

477
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,740
calculated front weight and then that

478
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,560
will update it in my CSS so you can

479
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,270
chuck that in a function or something

480
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,610
like that and then what we're gonna do

481
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,510
is add an event listener for resize

482
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,120
Chuck our function in there and what

483
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,250
that's going to do in its simplest form

484
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,980
is change the font weight based on the

485
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,270
viewport width now you can do all sorts

486
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,890
of things for performance and stuff but

487
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,560
in its simplest form that's what it does

488
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,760
and it might be something like this so

489
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,700
pixelated so sorry now what I'm doing

490
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,350
here is I'm actually changing the font

491
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,820
weight based on the viewport weight so

492
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,560
as it gets smaller the front weight gets

493
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,720
heavier and I'm changing it at different

494
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,940
rates depending on the paragraph but

495
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,650
what I'm also doing is changing the

496
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,480
width of the headline so that it doesn't

497
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,730
wrap onto a new line and what this means

498
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,620
is that I can maintain the integrity of

499
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,020
my design rather than just wrapping it

500
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,640
onto a new line and stacking everything

501
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,500
and I think this is really valuable and

502
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,900
really really useful when we're talking

503
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,970
about all of the different screen sizes

504
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,150
and devices that are out there now and

505
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,560
as I said this code can be used to

506
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,210
change all sorts of things when I made

507
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,580
this I didn't associate it with the fact

508
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,040
that my phone is completely smashed but

509
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,920
it's actually quite funny in hindsight

510
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,380
so this uses the device position and

511
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,370
orientation or we can do something

512
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,210
really interesting

513
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,330
this one will respond to audio input so

514
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,980
I'm gonna switch in a minute but um

515
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,780
there's a couple of things I wanted to

516
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,880
mention about it special thanks to Ruth

517
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,740
I don't know if she's here yet but she's

518
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,660
gonna be here doing stuff tomorrow I

519
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,700
originally wrote the code for this with

520
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,470
a library and I didn't think it was

521
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,150
quite right and she gave me some new

522
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,890
code for it which is super cool all

523
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:05,090
right let's try switching

524
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,200
so I'm just gonna let it use my

525
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,889
microphone yay I have a really loud

526
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:16,559
voice so it triggers it oh I probably

527
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,389
shouldn't have made it so sensitive but

528
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:19,830
as you can see what's happening here is

529
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,419
it's responding to the sound of my voice

530
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,750
and it's taking that audio input and

531
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,039
reacting accordingly and this is really

532
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,590
interesting for things like

533
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,759
conversational you eyes so that you can

534
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,580
visually represent the tone or the

535
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,440
intent of a person's input so like if

536
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,730
they're really loud maybe it's like

537
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,559
super bold or if they're really quiet

538
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:41,039
maybe it's you know really thin and I

539
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,240
just I think this is like a really cool

540
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,919
future possibility for us as things like

541
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,919
the Google home and Alexa become more

542
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:58,279
and more prevalent so what's next this

543
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,200
is really cool

544
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:07,049
one moment please so I'm just gonna

545
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:11,220
where's my mouse switch back over I'm

546
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,389
gonna go full screen for this one so

547
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:17,759
this font is called wool which I just

548
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,789
heard some of you say bye scribble tone

549
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:23,159
I kind of wish they called it slinky but

550
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:24,659
whoa kind of wax

551
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,759
what this is doing is it's changing

552
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:29,129
based on the mouse position and it's got

553
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:33,029
three axes that you can modify there's a

554
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:35,460
vertical horizontal and then there's a

555
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,799
rotation and I'm just passing the X&Y

556
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,009
coordinates or to the variable font with

557
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:42,809
that code that I just showed you to

558
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:50,639
update the axes I really like that

559
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,440
example because the fonts so cool the

560
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,799
thing to note about this is that

561
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,629
essentially again all the hard work is

562
00:23:57,629 --> 00:23:59,029
done in the font like that is an

563
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:01,470
incredible creation what they've done

564
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,919
there and it's just simply spectacular

565
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,330
this is a good opportunity to bring

566
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,429
yourself closer to people who create

567
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:10,230
fonts because I kind of feel like at the

568
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,389
moment we're very separate but now that

569
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:14,429
we can start to control the font in our

570
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:16,379
code and on the web I think this is a

571
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:18,000
really good opportunity to come together

572
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,810
and like

573
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,990
on things and solve problems together

574
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,790
but we can also do some other

575
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,100
interesting things like improve the

576
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,170
legibility of our text with new features

577
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,790
that allow us to query the

578
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,920
characteristics of the users display or

579
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,620
light level so this demo that I'm going

580
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,060
to show you it currently only works

581
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,210
behind a flag so the support isn't great

582
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,010
but it is a good demonstration of the

583
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,020
opportunities for the future what I'm

584
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,640
gonna do first is show you a little bit

585
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,120
of code so I didn't show you this before

586
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,860
but this is essentially what the CSS

587
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,560
looks like with the custom property the

588
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,720
font I'm going to use is called tiny and

589
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,600
it's what I'm doing is passing a value

590
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,490
to my custom property and then updating

591
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,050
it in the font weight value we set up

592
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,830
our default base ranges just like before

593
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,630
but instead of viewport width we're

594
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,650
using an ambient light sensor value and

595
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,510
then we're going to set up the ambient

596
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,420
light sensor so in this case we check if

597
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,010
we have access to the ambient light

598
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,190
sensor if we do we create a new instance

599
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,610
of that sensor and then what we can do

600
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,190
is start to gather readings from the

601
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,440
sensor using the on reading event

602
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,100
handler now the reading frequency is

603
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,020
decided by you you can pass an optional

604
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,180
value to the sensors constructor and

605
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,860
that will specify the number of readings

606
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,540
per second I'm not going to do that for

607
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,030
simplicity but you can do it and then

608
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,100
what we do is we pass that same function

609
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,290
that I showed you before I've called it

610
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,720
fluid access variation with all of our

611
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,330
values including the sensor dot

612
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,240
illuminance reading which is what we get

613
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,200
our current value from and then the

614
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,300
final step is telling the sensor to

615
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,140
start so the function with the values in

616
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,460
it manually might look something like

617
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,810
this but now I'm gonna show you what it

618
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,180
actually looks like this is probably I

619
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,370
say a lot of demos are my favorite but I

620
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,960
think this one really is my favorite a

621
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:32,520
promise

622
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,010
all right I'm just gonna get my handy

623
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,250
device here I'm gonna change the light

624
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,710
input so sorry if I'm shining my light

625
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,750
in anyone's eyes in the front row the

626
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,260
perils of the front row so what I'm

627
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,690
doing is it's detecting a change in the

628
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,090
light around my computer laptop sensor

629
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,340
and then the font is responding to it

630
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,160
now this is like really cool right it's

631
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,250
it's responding to the users environment

632
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,360
and you can use this to change the way

633
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,460
things are represented in low light

634
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,470
environments to improve legibility

635
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,480
accessibility and usability of your

636
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,260
sites but also and this is fun for me

637
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,380
you could create some really cool

638
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,930
like storytelling experiences like if it

639
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,730
was really dark you could make something

640
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,560
like cool thing where it gets all dark

641
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,050
and creepy I'm all the reverse of that

642
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,940
unicorns could appear to make people

643
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,750
feel safe unicorns I wish I wore my

644
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,000
unicorn pants instead of MySpace ones

645
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,640
I'll have to like work that out next

646
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,440
time hang on one second why switch back

647
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,540
cool so basically it's only because

648
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,550
variable fonts give us this more greater

649
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,560
control over each of these elements that

650
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,480
we can start to fine-tune the different

651
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,400
font characteristics to maximize the

652
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,500
legibility the readability and the

653
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,540
accessibility of our website text and

654
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,280
while they might seem a little bit

655
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,560
trivial and you might be like well I'll

656
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,470
never use that their demonstrations of

657
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,420
the possibilities and like I said like

658
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,820
this isn't just about fun stuff it does

659
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,130
give us an opportunity to respond to our

660
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,080
users environments and at their unique

661
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,870
circumstances it's a level of control

662
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,300
over fonts that's unprecedented for us

663
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,910
and I hope by the end of this conference

664
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,040
you'll agree but in my opinion it's

665
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,750
never been a better time to be a

666
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,390
developer or a designer on the web

667
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,130
variable fonts which is one of the many

668
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,840
things that open up doors that have

669
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,090
never existed for us before and we can

670
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,010
combine these things in any number of

671
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:45,799
ways

672
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,259
to think more creatively for our users

673
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,539
and to solve problems in more creative

674
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:54,769
ways and with variable fonts at the very

675
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:57,470
least we have the opportunity to improve

676
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,039
performance but at its best we can make

677
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,080
websites that are more usable more

678
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,440
accessible and more meaningful and that

679
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,720
to me is what gets me really really

680
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,059
really excited about the future of web

681
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:13,549
typography so I have some resources

682
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:16,220
which I'll share out should follow Ruth

683
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,210
for her awesome

684
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,899
audio stuff um specifically though I

685
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:29,879
made this website where are we

686
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:32,059
it's called variable fonts for

687
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:34,279
developers here's another cool fun Hey

688
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:37,009
I forget what this one's called I should

689
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:37,999
know this because I made it the other

690
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:42,039
day it's got this has kicked in mobile

691
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:48,080
version sad whoo the aspect ratio of

692
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,980
this is very low anyway it's got

693
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,179
tutorials for how to make the light

694
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:55,789
sensor demo and the gray demo and I will

695
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:57,950
add a whole bunch more on here in the

696
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,989
next few weeks there's also a getting

697
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:02,419
started page which will go through the

698
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:05,029
basics of setting up and using variable

699
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:06,739
fonts that you can go through and have a

700
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:07,940
look at if you want

701
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:13,680
it's called variable fonts dot dev

702
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,440
putting this microphone down and
