00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,300

you

2
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,320
so today i wanted to talk a little bit

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,970
about the future computing i think

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,770
that's kind of in tradition with jay s

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,970
comp and kind of talking about the

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,759
present and the future but i wanted to

7
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,230
start today by looking at where we've

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,079
been so in computing you know computing

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,330
started as a computer was something that

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,580
took up a whole room it was something

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,260
that only a government had access to

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,470
this is a this is an N evac it was a

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,150
computer that was developed in the

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,420
United States ran on vacuum tubes that's

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,650
what all those little those little all

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,150
those little knobs are and essentially

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,360
people ran around in suits changing

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,979
vacuum tubes frantically while wow this

19
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,199
computer started to compute or try to

20
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,000
compute something for us and so this is

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
very inaccessible to obviously the

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,040
average person and you know over the

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,540
next 10 years the computers became

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,790
accessible to people in in large

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,500
corporations they became accessible to

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,750
people in universities this is what am I

27
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,130
actually one of my favorite pictures in

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,100
computing this is a PDP 11 which is a if

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,240
any of you actually studied that in

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,920
university but it's a fantastic

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,930
architecture for its time and this is

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,740
Kernighan and richie at Bell Labs one of

33
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,780
my favorite research institutions and

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,920
always like to imagine it they're

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,079
inventing the C programming language but

36
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,670
this computer is a thousand times faster

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,950
than the previous one so thousands times

38
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,310
cheaper it's now accessible to two more

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,340
people and this trajectory increase i

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,659
think you know from here people know

41
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,060
kind of the story things computers got

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,009
less less expensive they got even more

43
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,780
powerful people at companies had access

44
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,159
to computers and then they are able to

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,619
start having them in their homes they

46
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,060
started you know these computers became

47
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,600
more mobile they came even even cheaper

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,310
until they came to the point where we

49
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,079
basically always have a computer in our

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,810
pocket and so computers now are

51
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,729
ubiquitous in our lives and it's you

52
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,140
know it's possible that one of these

53
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,880
things we start you know that we think

54
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,350
about what's next in computing and i

55
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,850
think because the mobile phone is is the

56
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,400
the current state of the art we start

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,870
thinking about what's next it's possible

58
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,150
that something like a watch or something

59
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,690
like a pair of glasses are really the

60
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,000
next thing but i really believe it's

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,439
next things that are going to be big and

62
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,580
computing are the things that are

63
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,200
already in our lives the everyday things

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,239
that are already in our lives so you

65
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:33,750
know

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,150
light switches electrical sockets

67
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,330
doorbells stop lights these are the

68
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,340
things that are I think that computing

69
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,900
is going to go to next and is really

70
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,600
good where a lot of change in our lives

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,260
are going to is going to occur and one

72
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,730
of the things that is driving this trend

73
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,640
this is the emergence of open and very

74
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,490
very inexpensive hardware so this is for

75
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,080
people that don't recognize it on site

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,709
this is what's called a raspberry pi

77
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,270
this is ben 445 US dollars it's a fully

78
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,930
featured computer it can run a full OS

79
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,550
it has hdmi out yes USB port has

80
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,980
everything and and more importantly and

81
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,260
so this this device is built for

82
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,930
emerging mark or emerging countries in

83
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,209
particular Africa and beyond that

84
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,050
couldn't afford a very expensive

85
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,030
computer so folks would hook this up to

86
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,800
their television set and plug in a

87
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,410
keyboard via USB and it's been really

88
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,660
successful in that sense a way that it's

89
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,640
being used that it was never know that

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,530
people did never imagined is that it's

91
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,570
being hooked up to every day saying so

92
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,489
these little pins along the edge there

93
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,260
are actually Jen what's called a

94
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,130
general-purpose eye open and that allows

95
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,750
you to hook it up to everyday things so

96
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,790
things that have analog values you know

97
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,680
voltages that that vary as opposed to

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,860
just digital ones and zeros and this has

99
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,330
led to an explosion of different types

100
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,100
of hardware and some of which are really

101
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,810
important I think for us is JavaScript

102
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,030
developers this is what's called a

103
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,860
tehsil this is a Kickstarter project

104
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,160
that a group of folks at MIT are working

105
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,450
on this runs JavaScript natively on a

106
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,739
betel piece of hardware it actually

107
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,530
compiles it to lua on the Lua vm and

108
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,720
runs it but you can hook in all these

109
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,550
little connectors you can hook in

110
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,500
additional things temperature sensors

111
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,800
Bluetooth connectors all sorts of things

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,660
that allow you to interface it with the

113
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,580
physical world and it's not alone

114
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,320
there's no there's another Kickstarter

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,729
project that's even more interesting in

116
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,030
my perspective called espera know which

117
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,070
is a completely open hardware design

118
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,400
that runs JavaScript natively and what's

119
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,440
really interesting about this is it's is

120
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,610
you could take this

121
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,650
add it to your hardware add it to your

122
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,810
projects even either in a personal sense

123
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,509
or in a professional sense and build

124
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,800
things that build upon this platform and

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,949
so you know the the the the trend I'm

126
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,569
trying to lead you here is that is that

127
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,550
this hardware is becoming much more

128
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,580
accessible and even the enclosure so

129
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,689
when you start thinking about you need

130
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,310
to enclose these product you know if you

131
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,270
want to use them in the real world

132
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,650
typically you need to enclose them in

133
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,930
plastic or something like that even the

134
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,509
way you design these these physical

135
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,639
enclosures is becoming software i

136
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,990
actually just discovered this program

137
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,419
this week it's called open s cad and

138
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,400
essentially what this is is it's a

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
programming language for building 3d

140
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,580
models so i want to build here i'm

141
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,939
building an enclosure for the Raspberry

142
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:35,099
Pi that i showed earlier and if you

143
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,569
lotus little to the left you have a

144
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,159
programming language that almost looks

145
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,050
like javascript and basically what it

146
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,479
allows you to do is to express the the

147
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,969
3d model that you want to build and so

148
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,039
here it's a little small and hard to

149
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,870
read but basically i'm taking two cubes

150
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,090
and I'm differencing them and that's

151
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,879
producing this kind of this this box

152
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,529
like enclosure that I'm going to use for

153
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,629
my raspberry pi so this is not obviously

154
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,009
not completed I just started on this

155
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:02,789
this week but you know the thing to

156
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,099
notice is that everything is becoming

157
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,919
much more it is being driven by software

158
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,520
and so in my opinion software is is is

159
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,300
is eating hardware this is an apple one

160
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,699
and so in when they built the apple on

161
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,020
the Apple one is the very first computer

162
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,159
that Apple made the software on this was

163
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,870
really more like hardware all those

164
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,400
chips along there that that Steve

165
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,199
Wozniak he basically designed the

166
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,969
program by putting different chips on

167
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:33,389
the board and you know you contrast that

168
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:34,889
to the previous slide where everything

169
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,569
was basically specified with software

170
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,569
you can see the arc of where we're going

171
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,339
wherever you know where computers used

172
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,289
to be you know literally pieces of

173
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:44,669
hardware that you glued together and

174
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,259
where you know we have the term bug

175
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,120
because actual moth flew into a computer

176
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,370
and caused a short between one of these

177
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,560
these electrical circuits the trajectory

178
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,689
is that if you start thinking about five

179
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,219
years out everything is going to be

180
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:59,520
software and I think a project that I

181
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,070
saw that kind of kind of

182
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,010
takes this glues this all together is is

183
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,480
a project that i saw on kickstarter

184
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,000
called the good night light and i think

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
this is a really interesting example is

186
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,330
because it's taken something is really

187
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,520
simple it's a light and it's only light

188
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,260
and it's made it really interesting

189
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,990
using the the things that I've just

190
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,940
talked about the computation and

191
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,940
connectivity so this light is you buy

192
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,240
them in a pair and it has it has a twist

193
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,430
and so in that you could maybe a little

194
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,200
bit hard to tell but on the top of this

195
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,640
this light there's a little chimney and

196
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,350
that's the button for the light and what

197
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,730
you do is you give one of these lights

198
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,500
to one of your loved ones and when you

199
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,570
push the chim your chimney it doesn't

200
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,890
turn on your life but it actually turns

201
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,900
out in their light in their house and so

202
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,130
this is a way that you can tell somebody

203
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,080
over a distance that you're thinking

204
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,340
about them and you know or you know or

205
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,550
whatever and I think this is really is

206
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,600
this really cool it's taken something

207
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,430
it's very simple it has a real-world

208
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,100
user interface and it's made it better

209
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,590
with computing and I think this is the

210
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,720
kind of shape of what computing is going

211
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,130
to look like in the future where you

212
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,480
interact with things in the ways of your

213
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,350
you know you're used to used to doing

214
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,300
and computing is completely behind the

215
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,950
scenes and just makes it happen the way

216
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,940
that you expect so you know as mentioned

217
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,000
in both of my intros I worked for a

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,100
company I called nest labs so nest labs

219
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,150
is building a thermostat thermostat you

220
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,880
know I used to guys obviously have

221
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,080
air-conditioning here but allows you to

222
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,460
you know to control the temperature in

223
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,099
your house and what this did is it

224
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,500
dynamically detected what temperatures

225
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,540
you liked at what times it could detect

226
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,880
if you walk past the thermostat and

227
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,770
automatically turn itself off and save

228
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,650
energy for the house and save you money

229
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,630
but when I you know then working on that

230
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,460
I learned know that that when you go to

231
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,370
do this for real it's really difficult

232
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,390
so the Internet of Things is very

233
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,620
difficult there's a number of problems

234
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,480
that you actually have to solve before

235
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,030
you can even get started and the reason

236
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,340
for this is that these these real things

237
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,730
in our lives are actually really

238
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,660
dangerous if they fall into the wrong

239
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,210
hands so if you think about the previous

240
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,640
example of a thermostat if somebody has

241
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,920
access to that and I actually come from

242
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,660
a very cold place and United State

243
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,910
it's in Michigan in the very north you

244
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,259
know where it can drop to negative 10

245
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,959
Celsius if a hacker gets access to that

246
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,879
and turns it turns basically turns off

247
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,800
my heater people you know it has

248
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,740
life-threatening consequences and so

249
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,209
when you start building real-world

250
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:31,610
products like this you need to think

251
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,910
about these things up front so how do

252
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,879
how does this device Afeni Kate who has

253
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,620
access or you know who has authorization

254
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,589
to use a device like this and then how

255
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:44,180
do these devices communicate with

256
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,889
applications so I thought I would you

257
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,209
know I there's you know there's a number

258
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,639
of models about how this would you know

259
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,959
how this potentially work but I thought

260
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,100
I would talk about that you know

261
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,139
controlling a light as one example and

262
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,180
one of the major ways that people are

263
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,529
talking about solving this problem is

264
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,149
through a messaging approach because

265
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:03,860
these devices aren't always connected

266
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,220
they for power reasons for connectivity

267
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,230
reasons you can't always assume that

268
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,930
they're connected at all time and so a

269
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,430
messaging approach works really well for

270
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,399
this and so you know you could think

271
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,410
about this and as in terms of its

272
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,610
sending commands to the light and

273
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,560
settings which you know responses back

274
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,800
from that so in this case I'm using

275
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,269
what's called a switch command to turn

276
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,069
on the light the light responds and says

277
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:31,519
okay I got you I got your I got you know

278
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,839
I got your command I've turned on the

279
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,269
light and and now it's on oh got a stray

280
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:41,810
arrow there sorry um I'm actually not at

281
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,430
the expert at powerpoint now I'm running

282
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,740
at keynote so who knows so what's

283
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,149
interesting about this if you start

284
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,420
thinking about that message stream is

285
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,100
that you you can start mining that

286
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,240
message stream to build really

287
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,269
interesting applications and so here I'm

288
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:57,079
diagrammed out how you might use

289
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,000
something like this to build a vacation

290
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,829
application so let's say you wanted your

291
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:05,180
life to go on and off automatically you

292
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,970
know while you're on vacation or not

293
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,319
while you're on vacation you could look

294
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:10,879
at when when you were normally turning

295
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,559
it on and then just basically replicate

296
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,269
that and so if you start using this

297
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:16,069
messaging model or think about it it's

298
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:17,720
kind of Twitter for devices this is the

299
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,550
kind of applications at these that this

300
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,430
enables and so I've been working with a

301
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,990
number of companies so as he mentioned i

302
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,939
worked with the microsoft accelerators

303
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,470
around the world so I working with a

304
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,890
number of companies to

305
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,810
to help them do you know launch their

306
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,550
products on Windows Azure and on Windows

307
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,940
platforms in general and one of the one

308
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,960
of the companies that I'm working with

309
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,490
is actually trying to add these types of

310
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,680
smarts to everyday items inside the

311
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,000
house n another one has a much more

312
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,880
industrial application for this inside

313
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,090
factory floors and you know as part of

314
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,590
working with them and when I experienced

315
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,020
in working at nest there's I realize

316
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,220
that there's always common set of

317
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,570
problems that are hard for people to get

318
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,910
right and so I started a project called

319
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,030
nitrogen and you know thanks to jay asia

320
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,370
for letting me talk about it but

321
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,640
essentially it's a platform that solves

322
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,110
all these hard problems for you so you

323
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,140
can focus on on your device on your

324
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,870
application and not have to solve this

325
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,790
you know reinvent the wheel so to speak

326
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,740
it's written completely the end to end

327
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,320
in JavaScript and that builds on my

328
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,000
belief that in the long term that

329
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,580
JavaScript given its ubiquity in the

330
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,960
computing industry is going to eat all

331
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,810
of software and so it's built I think I

332
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,280
mentioned in ojs and then the client

333
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,870
there's there's there's JavaScript

334
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,390
clients available as a node module then

335
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,090
also in the browser and I thought you

336
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,680
know that you know the best way to kind

337
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,540
of walk through it would be to do to

338
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,970
show an example and so what I've done

339
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,290
here is I'm going to I'm going to show

340
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,000
an example of how you would build the

341
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,280
internet connected camera using using

342
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,370
nitrogen so this is a Raspberry Pi again

343
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,340
the Raspberry Pi has a module you can

344
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,230
buy to add on that hooks in and it's a

345
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,120
camera so that's the camera connected

346
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,060
with a lead to the Raspberry Pi and so I

347
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,530
put this in an enclosure and I put it in

348
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,290
the front window of my house and one in

349
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,690
my garage and I've connected it using

350
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,970
nitrogen so I'm going to switch over

351
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,330
hopefully the github and show you the

352
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,700
code for this looks like so another

353
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,410
thing is all this code to all the code

354
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,420
that I nitrogen and all the sample code

355
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,550
that I've written is all apache2 license

356
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,170
so you're welcome to use it in your

357
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,220
projects to use it in at home for fun or

358
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,310
or whatnot and so what you know my gosh

359
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,929
that's small

360
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:44,769
that's right that better okay and so

361
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:46,420
this is an example of a device

362
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,009
application so this is running on the

363
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:51,100
Raspberry Pi running as a node

364
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,629
application and it's simple and that's

365
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:57,549
and that's really the you know the goal

366
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:00,269
of it right so there's really only one

367
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,499
there's really only one line attention

368
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:03,850
here so i have a configuration section

369
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,230
where i define all the cameras that i

370
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,869
have and then essentially i do a service

371
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:10,209
connect and this heavy handles all that

372
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,829
heavy lifting that we're talking about

373
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:14,829
that kind of you know list of pain that

374
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:16,209
we have when you start doing Internet of

375
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:17,410
Things projects it does all the

376
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,239
authorization or the afen occation and

377
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:21,730
all the authorization and it returns a

378
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,079
session that we can use for subsequent

379
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,290
things and then I also you know start a

380
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:31,660
new the i start a new a camera manager

381
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,459
and the manager inside nitrogen

382
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:35,829
essentially follows that that stream of

383
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:37,329
that the kind of Twitter stream of

384
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:40,179
messages for the camera and reacts to

385
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,149
command messages that are sent to it so

386
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,069
in this case I'm following all the all

387
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:46,929
the all the messages to and from this

388
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,410
this camera and reacting appropriately

389
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,910
and so one of the other things that I've

390
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,259
built as part of nitrogen is a really

391
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,689
simple kind of administrator should miss

392
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:59,850
no one more time that work one more time

393
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,189
nope not that many times all right so I

394
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:07,720
build a really simple admin tool and you

395
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,100
know what this allows you to do is see

396
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,230
how these devices are operating in your

397
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,970
you know in in the in the kind of the

398
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,309
network that you set up and so I'm going

399
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:21,790
to try here Wi-Fi willing and demo gods

400
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,410
willing to actually take a picture of I

401
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,749
have a picture of my garage and the

402
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:27,369
application that I'm thinking of here is

403
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:29,100
kind of using it as an alarm

404
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,179
unfortunately where I live in Santa Cruz

405
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:32,649
California there's a little bit of kind

406
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,929
of casual theft of bicycles so actually

407
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:39,040
right here I have a camera that's that's

408
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,749
in my garage looking at a set of

409
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:44,350
bicycles that we have and so it's dark

410
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,119
this makes me jet lag just looking at it

411
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,009
and I did that a little bit too fast but

412
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:49,449
I just did there as I issued

413
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,129
one of those those commands do that that

414
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,079
camera in my garage and it responded

415
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,389
back with an image and so you could see

416
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:58,600
I'll do one more ques up the snapshot

417
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,869
command sends it over to California

418
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,489
California camera takes a picture and

419
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:07,239
sends it back so that's the idea yeah

420
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:12,279
thank you thank goodness it works and so

421
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,199
that's the general idea right so you you

422
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,109
have you had these commands that are

423
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,489
your kind of well-defined with

424
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:20,350
well-defined schemas and then these

425
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,199
applications can use these commands to

426
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,149
to control things in the real world and

427
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:27,129
what's interesting about that is the

428
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:28,749
application knew nothing about the

429
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:30,189
device it doesn't know how that device

430
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,660
is implemented it doesn't know what kind

431
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,519
of camera it is it just knows that if it

432
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,829
issues a camera command that this this

433
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,040
camera can can answer to it and what's

434
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,359
interesting about that is you can start

435
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,470
building up really interesting

436
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,389
applications and so one of my art

437
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,449
projects is using the camera out the

438
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:48,699
front of my house I'm trying to take a

439
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:52,929
picture of a sunset every every day for

440
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,189
a full year and then I put it on a

441
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:58,089
poster or something so we'll see but you

442
00:16:58,089 --> 00:16:59,619
know of course you know the note those

443
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,289
years have done note I you know the the

444
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,970
note ecosystem is amazing i thought i

445
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,409
was gonna have to write my own sunset

446
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:07,240
calculator no of course not there's

447
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,919
already an amazing package called Sun

448
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,659
calc that allows you to you know

449
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:13,120
calculate the sunset of any place on

450
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,880
earth thank you hopefully you're out

451
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,220
there and you hear my thanks so what

452
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,419
I've done is this is looks really

453
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:20,500
complicated but it's actually pretty

454
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,689
simple i calculate the the sunset time

455
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,970
for when the Sun is point three degrees

456
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,939
above the horizon because I don't want

457
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:29,409
to be down completely otherwise you know

458
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:31,179
it's not really interesting picture then

459
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:33,309
I just basically look to see if I have I

460
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:35,080
have any of these sunset commands

461
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,090
already and the real you know the real

462
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,950
meat of this is I essentially send it a

463
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,809
message and I say hey at the sunset this

464
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,580
sunset time just take a photo for me and

465
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,289
just and put it in and put it into this

466
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:51,399
devices feed and that's really it and so

467
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,250
why what I've been doing is is is is

468
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,610
essentially collecting these whoops oh

469
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,419
yeah so and so I ran this before so I

470
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:03,129
stacked up right here you can see these

471
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:03,399
are all

472
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:05,289
actually commands in the future and I've

473
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,419
stacked up all these so it's ready to

474
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,089
take sunset images and of course I've

475
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,159
thousand IP messages I knew that was

476
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:17,679
going to happen hang on hopefully there

477
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:28,590
we go whoops

478
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,380
whoops

479
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,270
here somewhere

480
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,000
but basically I just could have

481
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,250
collected a there we go there there some

482
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,710
of the sunshine shots I've collected a

483
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,090
ton of these different sunsets and you

484
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,140
can see now that we're in the winner

485
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,150
it's starting to be you know more cloudy

486
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,309
and whatnot and so I think that's you

487
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,350
know the idea is that these applications

488
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,540
don't have to know about the devices

489
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,460
they're using and you start building up

490
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,990
these really interesting feeds that then

491
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,240
different applications can use to build

492
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,210
you know interesting applications with

493
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,260
so let me switch back to this I don't

494
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,120
have much more but you know if you're

495
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,700
interested in this area you know I've

496
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,920
talked about this as and I'm sure your

497
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,960
your kind of thinking that you know this

498
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,120
is completely you know why do I need to

499
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,980
know anything about this but I would

500
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,450
challenge you to think back seven years

501
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,070
and how you thought about the mobile web

502
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,770
and you I think many of you if you think

503
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,059
back seven years you would never have

504
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,070
guessed that you know your day to day

505
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,990
job today you'd spend a predominant

506
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,420
amount of time thinking about mobile and

507
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,620
I actually think that it's gonna be very

508
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,120
similar for these everyday things I

509
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,530
think if you look out seven years I

510
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,179
think you know a lot of us will be doing

511
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,570
things that have a lot of impact I have

512
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,130
a lot to do with everyday things and

513
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,050
working with hardware so I would

514
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,370
challenge you even if you don't you're

515
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,780
not used to this but to actually do look

516
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,730
into it and start getting you know start

517
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,230
learning a little bit about these these

518
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,080
these different platforms and so I just

519
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,280
thought I'd talk to finish off by

520
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,240
talking about a couple things that I

521
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,710
want to do in the future with the

522
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,500
platform then I'm happy to take

523
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,690
questions the first is I you know the

524
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,740
current Internet of Things has a very

525
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,059
very centralized model so these devices

526
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,679
connect directly into a cloud service

527
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,559
and and communicate back and forth I

528
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,820
don't think this is the right approach

529
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,490
for two reasons the first is a very that

530
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,750
is a very high latency solution so you

531
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,890
know the previous presenter mentioned

532
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,870
you know making a trip out to all the

533
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,670
way out to you know potentially across

534
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,770
the country to a cloud service and back

535
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,660
and can you know be up to 400

536
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,780
milliseconds or 600 milliseconds and it

537
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,100
for a lot of applications that's too

538
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,150
that's too you know it's too much time

539
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,800
and the second thing is this gives up a

540
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,870
lot of our privacy so these are the

541
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,300
Internet of Things these everything when

542
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,770
computing it goes out to everything in

543
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,050
our lives sending back all this data to

544
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,220
a centralized place I think

545
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,010
is is really dangerous and so one of the

546
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,120
things that I'm working out as part of

547
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,470
this project is to figure out how we can

548
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,990
distribute this such that we have

549
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,960
control over how this data is sent up to

550
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,450
cloud services and so instead of sending

551
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,610
everything about our presence in our

552
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,559
house and no matter our likes and

553
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,390
dislikes and and all these types of

554
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,309
things up to a cloud service that a lot

555
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:12,630
of that data we actually reside in our

556
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,309
house and we would decide what we need

557
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,270
want to exchange that with an

558
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,220
application that may exist in the public

559
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,280
cloud another thing we need to think

560
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,960
about you know is that I'm thinking

561
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,450
about as this project is how you how you

562
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,030
keep these devices up-to-date I think as

563
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,090
we ant Lee demonstrated today with our

564
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,159
with our with with by a connectivity

565
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,440
woes we have a long way to go in terms

566
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,030
of making devices you know plug-and-play

567
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,400
completely plug and play this is an

568
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,659
extreme example this is actually a

569
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:42,110
climate sensor that's down in Antarctica

570
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,299
and I use an extreme example because you

571
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,159
know for somebody to do an upgrade of

572
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,380
this let you know assuming they didn't

573
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,090
have any connectivity you know they'd

574
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,320
have to take a snowmobile and I'd

575
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,299
probably and you know involved in a very

576
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,179
thick coat at the least to get out here

577
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,059
and so I think this is an extreme

578
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,669
example but as the number and we started

579
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,650
extending computing out to these devices

580
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,650
in our house and our intern our

581
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,539
businesses there's going to be too many

582
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,549
of them to manually manage them it's not

583
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:14,280
going to be okay to do an OS upgrade or

584
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,710
upgrade you know update all on mine your

585
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,230
applications like we do on our phone it

586
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,049
can't be that primitive it has to be

587
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,620
completely managed in a transparent

588
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,090
sense otherwise we're all going to go

589
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,830
insane even no matter how much we love

590
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,169
technology and so one of the things I'm

591
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:32,480
working on is being able to

592
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,770
transparently upgrade the applications

593
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,480
and the firmware and the things that run

594
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,299
on these devices and then also extending

595
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:43,750
it out to the smallest and the most

596
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,140
embedded the most very you know

597
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,390
lightweight not very much processing

598
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,070
power devices so that's all I have I

599
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,470
somehow managed to cut out my slide with

600
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,620
anyway with the links to this but go to

601
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,720
nitrogen do if you're interested it's

602
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm building all of this in

603
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,120
and I'm taking JavaScript as far as I

604
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,120
can with this problem I think there's

605
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,020
going to some devices where we have to

606
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,510
use C++ but javascript I think could do

607
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,400
can go very deep into this into this

608
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,890
problem and if you're interested in

609
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,890
contributing I would love to I'd love to

610
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,210
have your help and yeah thanks for

611
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,590
letting me come and talk to my crazy

612
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,910
project Kim yeah got a question yeah one

613
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,500
of the devices that he mentioned you

614
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,860
said that the that the javascript is

615
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,720
being compiled down to lure yeah that's

616
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,280
why is that I think it's from a resource

617
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,100
perspective I didn't know I didn't

618
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,330
design that so I can't say for certain

619
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,220
but I think their idea was that the Lua

620
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,660
vm was a little bit more memory can

621
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,620
efficiently efficient oh yeah I don't

622
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,450
know why but that the that's that's the

623
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,090
tehsil the tehsil hardware and they're

624
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,250
very open folk so you can approach them

625
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,730
on the web and right nice thanks yeah i

626
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,900
think i could try to answer that a

627
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,770
little weight yeah essentially Lua from

628
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,830
the almost the very beginning has been

629
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,000
they've been trying to make it in such a

630
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,760
way that it really should be for

631
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,940
embedded applications and there isn't a

632
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,670
sort of a vm that has optimized for

633
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,590
embedded applications for javascript not

634
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,890
yet mm-hmm so it's the best way to go
