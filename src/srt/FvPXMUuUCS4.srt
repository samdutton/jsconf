1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049

hear me yeah perfect okay cool so yeah

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,290
as Vanessa said I'm Carolyn and I work

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,000
as a technical writer and a front-end

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,820
developer in Berlin and I'm here to talk

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,960
to you about humanizing your

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,360
documentation and for the sake of this

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,330
talk documentation is defined as the

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,430
information that describes products to

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,920
its users and this can mean anything

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,320
from API references to getting started

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,359
guides to anything in between so I want

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,700
to start off with the single question

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,489
why do we even write documentation is it

14
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,350
because our competitors have it or

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,440
because someone told us to do it or is

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,120
it because we really want the people

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,920
using our software to achieve their

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,430
goals it should be the latter but mm

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,890
that's usually not the case writing

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,989
documentation is often afterthought is

21
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,690
something that we just get done but what

22
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,550
if we gave our documentation the same

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,010
time and consideration that we do the

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,430
features we ship use case driven

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,530
documentation derives from the idea of

26
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,689
goal driven documentation both of which

27
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,610
were coined and made popular by Tanner

28
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,490
Blaine in 2006 and it works like this

29
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,490
put your users goals at the focal point

30
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,140
of your Docs instead of just describing

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,700
interface elements from left to right

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,549
and a common way to illustrate this idea

33
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,920
is a drill so if we approach documenting

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,119
this drill the same way that most

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,430
document software will end up with

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,820
something like this how to adjust the

37
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,860
speed how to change the direction of the

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,369
drill how to change the drill bit so now

39
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,680
you know how to operate a drill but you

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,180
don't actually know how to accomplish

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,850
anything with it and these are known as

42
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,680
reference documentation and their

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,390
information oriented they describe the

44
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,299
machinery and they're always or they try

45
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,329
to always be accurate and complete and

46
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,590
while this documentation type of

47
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,840
documentation is certainly necessary it

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,110
could definitely use a more nurturing

49
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,270
counterpart so if we reach reshape our

50
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,430
thinking just a bit and think about what

51
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,920
it takes to do the job and not just use

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,410
the tool we could end up with something

53
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,840
like this how to drill a hole in a flat

54
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,960
surface whether it's

55
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,210
or metal how to select the right screw

56
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,520
for fastening items how to stir paint

57
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,620
with your drill suddenly the

58
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,360
documentation is helping us achieve our

59
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,420
goals and these guides are goal-oriented

60
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,100
they show you how to solve a specific

61
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,350
problem and they're typically presented

62
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,920
in a series of steps but why is this

63
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,560
approach because successful well to

64
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,910
begin to understand that we need to

65
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,130
think back to that original question why

66
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,230
even write dogs and perhaps more

67
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,720
importantly we need to consider who are

68
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,150
we writing documentation for and the

69
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,740
answer is surprisingly simple humans so

70
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,470
yeah yeah with the development of BOTS

71
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,940
and AI this answer could certainly

72
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,970
change in the next couple years but for

73
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,680
now most software documentation is

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,540
written with the idea that humans will

75
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,600
read it and humans need that guidance

76
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,230
that documentation is meant to provide

77
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,490
that's why that these same principles

78
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,260
for the drill can also apply to our

79
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,510
software and we aren't writing

80
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,960
documentation to teach someone how to

81
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,940
work with our software but rather we're

82
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,220
teaching it someone how to achieve their

83
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,950
goals and solve their problems using our

84
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,770
software now let's apply this idea to

85
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,210
something more applicable to our

86
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,100
industry say slack slack is a

87
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,350
cloud-based set of team collaboration

88
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,840
tools and because I know they have a

89
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,250
developer portal and thorough

90
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,410
documentation I crawled their sites for

91
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,400
examples and here's what I found as

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,440
expected they have those information and

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,600
oriented reference Docs that we talked

94
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,450
about earlier they teach us how to add a

95
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,360
bot user to our slack app programming

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,490
those bot users and how to subscribe to

97
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,730
event types with the events API that's

98
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,100
nice but maybe as a first-time slack

99
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,910
user I'm not sure how or why I would

100
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,270
need these features so this is a

101
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,700
screenshot from the exact same site just

102
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,550
a different page notice how they are not

103
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,000
only giving us use cases creating simple

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,430
workflows building BOTS but they're also

105
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,190
outlining what we can accomplish you

106
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,780
know creating a simple workflow by

107
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,180
completing

108
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,210
ryouta mating tasks like requests and

109
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,250
approvals or building a bot so we can

110
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,979
talk with our users and it points to

111
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,630
that reference documentation that we saw

112
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,630
in the previous slide and now that we

113
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,699
have an idea of what use case driven

114
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,979
documentation is let's take a look at

115
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,970
the outline so when you develop a use

116
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,010
case you typically start with a goal

117
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,260
then if you're using use case driven

118
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,270
development or something similar the

119
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,740
rest of your workflow should look

120
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,680
something like this you'll define the

121
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,870
functional requirements you'll design

122
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,000
the product and then you'll implement

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,490
the feature this is called a structured

124
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,410
requirements approach and with an

125
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,600
approach like this we've already solved

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,490
half the problem determining what to

127
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,669
document the thing is is that most what

128
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,070
most documentation is doing is starting

129
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,350
at this implementation phase it's once

130
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,970
you've already finished that feature and

131
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,110
this is ok it works the docs get done

132
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,639
but what a use case driven approach is

133
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,820
suggesting is that we start here at you

134
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,510
probably guessed it the use case and the

135
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,740
beauty of this is that you can design

136
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,380
your documentation simultaneously with

137
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,060
the features that you're developing and

138
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,700
when we use this structured requirements

139
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,710
approach we have an established

140
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,740
framework for defining the problems that

141
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,349
where our software will solve and we

142
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,150
also can articulate how people will

143
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,340
solve these problems with use cases and

144
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,010
then these use cases define exactly what

145
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,370
we should be documenting but there's a

146
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,750
problem with that approach first it

147
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,539
requires a fundamental change in how our

148
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,630
team tackles documentation and that's

149
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,539
not always possible also it sounds more

150
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,449
like this beautiful ideal instead of our

151
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:18,630
you know immediate reality also those

152
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,400
reference Docs you know the ones that

153
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,560
describe what the software can do those

154
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,780
are why documentation have such a bad

155
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,199
rep in this industry they tend to be dry

156
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,250
and really leave us wanting more

157
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,229
personally I know this feeling all too

158
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:36,659
well because even if I write technical

159
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:39,990
content for a living I still have a

160
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,090
pretty unsatisfying relationship with

161
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,660
documentation about this time last year

162
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,240
and after two years of working in tech

163
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,540
as a journalist or a writer I decided to

164
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,000
take the dive and learn to code and I

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,810
knew exactly what I wanted to focus on

166
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,890
JavaScript but okay I don't know how you

167
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,560
guys felt while you were learning but it

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,500
felt like to me every single day I was

169
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,130
asking myself something like what is

170
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,440
going on in my text editor in my

171
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,060
terminal it didn't matter where I looked

172
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,550
I had no idea what was happening

173
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,290
am I the only one who finds this

174
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,510
confusing because I know there are a lot

175
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,700
of people working in JavaScript and they

176
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,450
seem to be thriving but not me not so

177
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,090
much at the moment and do people

178
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,660
actually enjoy this and will I ever

179
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,790
think that programming things with

180
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,020
JavaScript is fun spoil their I got it

181
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,410
together it's pretty fun now but it felt

182
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,240
like in order to do the interesting

183
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,400
things with JavaScript you needed to

184
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,650
know the advanced features not to

185
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,150
mention all of the frameworks and

186
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,910
toolings it felt impossible to keep up

187
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,850
but the most detrimental part I think of

188
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,620
my learning experience was the

189
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,230
documentation I was finding it was

190
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,540
supposed to be fueling my learning but

191
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,670
it was actually stunting it for the most

192
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,610
part and more often than not I felt

193
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,430
really deflated after reading dogs and

194
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,250
my questions they're still left

195
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,420
unanswered and the thing is I'm not

196
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,390
alone in feeling like this documentation

197
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,220
is one of the largest pain points for

198
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,490
developers just search reading

199
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,990
documentation on Twitter and you'll see

200
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,140
that most of the tweets are same not so

201
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,260
positive and here's some of my favorites

202
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,120
actually that I found just within the

203
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,700
last week

204
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,950
hi I was reading your documentation and

205
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,900
you described this data in two different

206
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,110
ways which is correct

207
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,480
thank you the way it works is third

208
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,560
completely different description

209
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,320
or this one nothing like spending a day

210
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,990
reading a hundred and thirty-seven page

211
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,529
PDF for CMS documentation puts head down

212
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:08,880
on desk and cries I would cry too and

213
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,950
this is my personal favorite bad

214
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,790
documentation is bad and even after

215
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,400
someone else asked this person if there

216
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,550
were no Docs would it be better she

217
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,160
still said deep thoughts honestly yes

218
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,420
because it would waste less of my time

219
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,350
so people love to hate documentation but

220
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,510
I believe that's also on us the people

221
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,240
who write Docs because it seems like we

222
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,100
hate them right back think about the

223
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,300
term users Laura call bag a designer and

224
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,010
accessibility advocate explains this

225
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,910
well she says I tend to not to not even

226
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,279
refer to people as users I refer to them

227
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,279
just as the people who use things she

228
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,260
explains that this is because when we

229
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,920
say user as a developer we're separating

230
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,890
ourselves we turn the people who use our

231
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,820
products into this far away thing and we

232
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,320
don't necessarily think of them as

233
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,980
someone who is just like us and that's

234
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,140
why as a technical writer at my job I

235
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,810
have needed to constantly remind our

236
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,950
developers or myself even that we are

237
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,070
writing for humans and not just that but

238
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,470
we are writing for humans who don't even

239
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,410
want to be reading what we're writing

240
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,790
because people as been as I mentioned

241
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,440
people don't enjoy reading technical

242
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,540
documentation for the most part people

243
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,670
visit your documentation when they're

244
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,520
frustrated they're already mad they're

245
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,170
frustrated with your software they're

246
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,730
disappointed that they haven't been able

247
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,520
to solve the problem on their own and

248
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,260
they're generally feeling pretty low and

249
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,810
that reality is not awesome especially

250
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,490
if you are someone who puts a lot of

251
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,620
love and care and consideration into

252
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,990
your documentation but being aware of

253
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,730
these negative feelings that your

254
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,700
readers are experiencing is key because

255
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,710
these emotions frame the readers

256
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,270
effective and therefore they should

257
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:16,170
shape the mood of our Docs so what were

258
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,910
these issues that I had with the

259
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,060
documentation I found well I could put

260
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,700
all of it into three categories

261
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,920
they were disorienting the underlying

262
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,500
structure was difficult to follow and

263
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,510
and in some cases the docks were not

264
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,120
accessible as in I literally couldn't

265
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
read them because of the way they were

266
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,210
programmed

267
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,550
they were alienating so some

268
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,290
documentation I read it made me feel

269
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,930
super isolated afterwards there were

270
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,910
words or concepts that were assumed

271
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,990
knowledge difficult syntax and that were

272
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,360
never explained and not to mention the

273
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,010
use of gendered or discriminatory

274
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,610
language and finally they were just

275
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,850
plain confusing and it was clear that

276
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,950
the developers working on these features

277
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,500
I was reading the docs about had a huge

278
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,440
depth of knowledge but it wasn't exactly

279
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,930
translating to me as a first-time or

280
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,560
generally pretty new user so now let's

281
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,270
run through each of these one by one

282
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,090
I'll show you the problems with examples

283
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,330
of what not to do followed by some tools

284
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,920
and role models that can help us do

285
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,470
better and all of the what not to do

286
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,660
examples are come from the software

287
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,820
documentation that's actually live on

288
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,120
the internet but I'm trying not to make

289
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,840
too many enemies during this talk so

290
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,430
I've adapted some of them to go back to

291
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,560
that drill example just to keep it keep

292
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,360
the end of em keep it anonymous so let's

293
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,640
start with disorienting a big part of

294
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,160
that as I mentioned was the poorly

295
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,220
defined structure and how we structure

296
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,230
our documentation is really important

297
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,630
because it shapes that learning journey

298
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,480
for our user and the overall experience

299
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,810
for our readers and if the structure is

300
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,840
not well-defined you lose control of how

301
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:13,350
people interpret your work here's one of

302
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,890
those not-so-great examples and again

303
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,920
adaptive for the drill um so here's

304
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,550
here's the short story

305
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,649
getting up and running quickly with your

306
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:28,870
drill one read the documentation to read

307
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,110
the documentation 3 remember that you

308
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,330
were warned twice about reading

309
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,250
documentation like art 1 if I'm in the

310
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,810
getting started guide aren't I already

311
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,430
reading the documentation and it goes on

312
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,740
after this to just list off every

313
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,810
command optional or not that's possible

314
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,420
with this tool and I specifically put a

315
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,120
screenshot because I I can't make this

316
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,860
up I cannot make up that someone just

317
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,500
wrote this and it's particularly bad

318
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,240
because getting started guides or any

319
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,860
sort of introduction err materials are

320
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,760
your first impression to potential users

321
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,180
so how can we combat this a mindful

322
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,690
structure whether it's just in one

323
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,390
particular article or throughout your

324
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,350
entire doc app in development we want to

325
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,910
have a clear and easy to follow

326
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,959
structure and when in doubt especially

327
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,180
for individual articles I would aim for

328
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,420
something like this talk about one

329
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,520
specific feature use that kind of

330
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,440
reference Docs and explain what it

331
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,200
really does go on to explain potential

332
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,350
use cases that people could use this or

333
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,970
the best case scenario for people to use

334
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,390
this and finally offer solutions then

335
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,839
for tooling integrations etc because

336
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,279
then you can kind of guide the reader

337
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,029
into what to go to next and this covers

338
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,410
all of your bases it has those

339
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,360
information oriented reference Docs it

340
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,350
has the goal oriented guides and like I

341
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,570
mentioned it plugs what where they

342
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,890
should go next in their journey the next

343
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,240
big issue is unexpected errors so have

344
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,550
you ever read something that I don't

345
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,589
know says something like just run this

346
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:18,970
snippet and you're good to go

347
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,850
but then when you run the code you get a

348
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,769
big fat error like unfortunately this is

349
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:29,440
all too common and when error messages

350
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,750
do come up a lot of times they tend to

351
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,350
look like this we have lost connection

352
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,110
to our server and disabled editing

353
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,940
features please verify that you have

354
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,970
internet access

355
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,510
ok this literally tells me nothing all I

356
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,280
know is that I need to check my

357
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,340
connection but I don't understand why my

358
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,000
editing features are disabled will they

359
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,850
still will my changes still save did the

360
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,980
connection go down is mine is it theirs

361
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,690
I don't know so we should consider and

362
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,670
address common errors whenever we know

363
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,040
them and because this helps reassure

364
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,200
your users that mistakes will happen

365
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,930
errors will happen but it also provides

366
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,570
options for troubleshooting so when

367
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,430
you're writing these error messages try

368
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,850
to explain what happened and why and

369
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:28,300
then tell the readers what to do next so

370
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,400
here's a better solution for our error

371
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,600
mishap earlier this tells you what

372
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,750
happened the fields are locked why it

373
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,390
happened because of no internet

374
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,420
connection and its implications so that

375
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,060
you won't lose changes it appears you

376
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,320
aren't connected to the Internet at the

377
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,240
moment the fields are temporarily locked

378
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,210
so you won't lose any important changes

379
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,660
here's another example and this is a

380
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,300
screenshot from the Apple 2 basic

381
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,620
programming manual from yes the 1970s it

382
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,780
tackles the nuances of common user

383
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,610
errors quite well and they actually

384
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,430
explain many of the syntax errors before

385
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:13,210
they even have you start coding and this

386
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,980
example in particular also follows

387
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,930
that's three-step approach it tells us

388
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,740
what happened

389
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,410
you got a beep and the syntax error

390
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,770
message why it happened

391
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,500
you probably press return and what to do

392
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,720
next it literally just says for the time

393
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,550
being ignore this message and that's

394
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,450
perfectly fine when we're formatting

395
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,520
these error alerts I'm in a tutorial

396
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,680
especially Django Girls is a great

397
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,740
resource to reference they do a great

398
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,890
job as scattering these types of notes

399
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,660
throughout the tutorial and the format

400
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,059
is clear so that it enables

401
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:50,950
it enables them to be informative enough

402
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,690
so if people are having errors they know

403
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,289
what to do not to panic and it they're

404
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,909
not so distracting so if you're not

405
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,649
having these errors it's easy to kind of

406
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:02,919
brush through them alright that's the

407
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,960
last of the disoriented category so

408
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,230
let's move on to alienating and the

409
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,249
first thing that comes to mind with

410
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:12,970
alienating is insensitive language and

411
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,909
this one can be tricky because across

412
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:18,549
nationalities and personalities you know

413
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,580
in sensitive language or phrase wording

414
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,259
or phrasing it can mean a lot of

415
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:26,559
different things and in this case we're

416
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,289
mostly talking about gendered language

417
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:31,869
profanity racial slurs or anything that

418
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:35,379
kind of falls under those lines so some

419
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:38,590
bad exam or not-so-great examples if the

420
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,869
programmer wishes to uphold invariant he

421
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,360
must satisfy the functions preconditions

422
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,659
as a woman Tech I hate reading

423
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,399
documentation like this because I

424
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:50,379
already feel pretty ostracized in the

425
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,960
community a lot of times and having

426
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,509
something like this shows me that this

427
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,529
isn't for me or this one in this guide I

428
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,259
will show you three main ways to hide

429
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:05,559
your first of all profanity is

430
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,059
probably not the way to go and also it

431
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,200
doesn't really tell me what it's doing

432
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,629
and both of these are relatively tame

433
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:14,440
examples but they show instances of you

434
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,450
know this insensitive language both in

435
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,299
both instances they won't always some

436
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,279
people might find it funny but a lot of

437
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:23,049
people it won't go over well in your

438
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:26,350
community so you can think before you

439
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,830
type easier said than done but a good

440
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,840
rule to follow is when documenting code

441
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,039
don't make assumptions or make any

442
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,679
implications about race gender religion

443
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,629
political orientation or really anything

444
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:42,730
else that isn't relevant to your product

445
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,749
and or you can have a linter do it for

446
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:51,009
you so this is Alex jeaious and it and

447
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:54,909
it catches insensitive and polarizing

448
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:56,860
writing in your markdown files and also

449
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,280
suggest helpful alternatives

450
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,940
you can use it on the command line or as

451
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,330
an integration with atom sublime vs code

452
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,540
and even slack and it's also open source

453
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,040
so if you run into some words that

454
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,260
you're like hey I don't know if I'm cool

455
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,640
with this but they're not catching it

456
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,150
you can feel free to contribute I would

457
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,740
also say you should still have a human

458
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,600
an actual human being read over it

459
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,460
preferably someone who's not from your

460
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,460
same nationality or demographic but it's

461
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,540
a good start so here's that same

462
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,130
sentence from earlier but now Alex

463
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,559
jeaious is helping us catch those words

464
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,320
that might be better left out of our

465
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,600
documentation and on that note of words

466
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,090
not to use don't say simply easily easy

467
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,170
simple just leave it out James Harrison

468
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,450
Fisher actually gave an entire talk at

469
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,250
read the docks London about this very

470
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,190
topic at one point he searched the word

471
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,330
simply on github and he found over 92

472
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,590
million references in documentation on

473
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,730
github and it's just not appropriate for

474
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,059
example simply connect to the HTTP

475
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:20,920
endpoint at API dot my drill comm and

476
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,630
that was it but so ok but we don't know

477
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,370
how to do this or this one we simply

478
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,230
start parsing an expression and

479
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,840
afterwards if the next token is a colon

480
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,059
and the expression was a simple

481
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:40,330
identifier node then dot the dot I don't

482
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,010
know about you but this doesn't sound so

483
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,510
simple to me and my solution for this

484
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,640
don't use it and just take the word out

485
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,220
completely because really after fixing

486
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,490
bugs for hours do you really want

487
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,830
someone to say to you like but this was

488
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,070
so easy respect people's time and

489
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,320
people's progress and just find another

490
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,230
way to say it be more specific and

491
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,770
figure out why you think it's simple try

492
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,600
it maybe as an alternative being

493
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,860
comparative so X requires less typing

494
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,970
then why or even better be absolute five

495
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,169
lines of code

496
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,500
the next issue that's alienating is

497
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,679
bloated language or these kind of overly

498
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,670
complicated and robust prose and okay

499
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:39,850
sip of water before this next one this

500
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,890
approach will work for our specific use

501
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,170
case but we haven't achieved the

502
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,030
objective of truly encapsulating the

503
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,090
behavior in a reusable way now every

504
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,799
time we want the drill position for a

505
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,900
different use case we have to create a

506
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,059
new component ie essentially another

507
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:57,280
drill with screw that renders something

508
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,120
specifically for that use case that's a

509
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,340
mouthful that's a lie and it's only two

510
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,730
sentences um and it's difficult to read

511
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,179
and difficult to comprehend at least on

512
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:13,480
the first try so an alternative is to

513
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,929
use plain language we want to choose our

514
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,280
language intentionally when we're

515
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,799
writing documentation and using plain

516
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,630
language is critical for a more

517
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,840
inclusive documentation but it can be

518
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,940
difficult because especially if you went

519
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,740
to university they really try to get

520
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,080
that out of you because plain language

521
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,690
is seen as a negative thing but in

522
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,270
reality it's just allowing more people

523
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,160
to understand and comprehend our work

524
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,850
and again there is an app that can help

525
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,929
you so this is Hemingway editor and it

526
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:48,850
is a tool to paste your text in and

527
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,740
it'll highlight problematic words or

528
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,049
sentences for you as well as offer

529
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:55,510
suggestions it's available as a text

530
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,910
editor application a web app and even a

531
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,809
linter and so in the case of the example

532
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,150
that we just had it identified that the

533
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,799
first sentence is hard to read that's

534
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,290
why it's highlighted in yellow the

535
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,360
sentence the second sentence is very

536
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,480
hard to read so it's in red um it

537
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,850
highlights adverbs in blue because

538
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,429
they're not necessary for what we're

539
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:21,040
trying to say and it also points out

540
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,540
words that could have had a simpler

541
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,520
alternative so in this case objective

542
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,659
and our sentence right now is

543
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:31,269
grade 12 and we want to get that down

544
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,309
and you want to stay around a maximum of

545
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:36,369
grade 8 reading level and never worry

546
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:39,029
about a reading level being too low

547
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:41,559
because as the amazing

548
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,259
Ashley bishops once said no one has ever

549
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:46,269
complained about something being too

550
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:52,059
easy to read and now to the issue of it

551
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,049
being confusing

552
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:55,690
fortunately out of the three issues this

553
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,369
one is actually the one that comes from

554
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:01,239
a good place so for instance you're just

555
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:04,840
in way too deep so when you're working

556
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,369
as a developer it can be difficult to

557
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:08,200
write documentation because you're so

558
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,479
deep in that product and that specific

559
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:14,440
feature that you're developing so what

560
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,970
often happens is that while you're

561
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,979
writing documentation you might be

562
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:19,690
talking writing it as if you're talking

563
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,460
to you yourself or maybe one of your

564
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,889
colleagues but the problem is is that

565
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:28,239
new users or it really any user B don't

566
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:30,220
have that same frame of reference that

567
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,029
you do and so any you know unexplained

568
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:37,749
term or skipped step in a tutorial can

569
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:39,489
destroy the learning journey for that

570
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,049
reader and really put them off of your

571
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:44,830
documentation so it's important to keep

572
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,989
in mind that everyone is a beginner at

573
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:49,960
some point and no matter how intuitive

574
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,239
you think your product is or tool my

575
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:56,200
beam everyone start some way what I've

576
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,470
found to be effective is that is it's

577
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,179
for you to go through the entire process

578
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:04,389
from start to finish and talk out loud

579
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:06,279
while you're doing it or explain the

580
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:08,710
feature as you're going along and have

581
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,629
another colleague close by preferably

582
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:12,009
someone who's not working on the same

583
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:14,440
project take notes about what you are

584
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,869
doing and identify those points that

585
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:20,369
might be confusing or unclear to others

586
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:25,149
and another confusing issue that kurz

587
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:28,330
frequently is that your product isn't a

588
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,950
good fit for the person who's reading it

589
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,869
and that's okay just be transparent so

590
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:37,179
when you know there's a specific use

591
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,970
case that maybe this tool or integration

592
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,460
doesn't work well with just say so

593
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,320
you'll save people a lot of headaches

594
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,930
and long run and also in your

595
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,690
introduction material it helps to remind

596
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,660
people to double check that this tool is

597
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,700
appropriate for what they're trying to

598
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,010
accomplish

599
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,690
the reason documentation does this quite

600
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,780
well in their converting from Jas page

601
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,580
they emphasize that you should make sure

602
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,000
that reason is fitting your needs and it

603
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,610
also points out that you shouldn't

604
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,930
unnecessarily thrash your colleagues

605
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,480
over other languages and frameworks but

606
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,000
for the record that's always unnecessary

607
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,510
you shouldn't do that so I hope that

608
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,550
I've given you a some a new tool to

609
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,260
implement or maybe some new ways to

610
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,080
update your documentation checklist but

611
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,880
before I get off the stage I want to

612
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,500
leave you with something that I learned

613
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,690
during my time working at contentful and

614
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,020
I believe that it's wise words that are

615
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,520
applicable for anyone writing

616
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,280
documentation so when I read through

617
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,500
content tools style guide something

618
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,290
immediately struck me and at the very

619
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,680
beginning it says we aim for accuracy

620
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,220
and consistency sure this is the case

621
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,190
for most Docs but what really got me is

622
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,120
what came next we also want to aim to be

623
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,020
honest helpful and human honest in that

624
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,880
we communicate the pros and cons of a

625
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,070
solution because in doing so will build

626
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,400
trust helpful because we want our users

627
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,890
to succeed I mean their success is

628
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,620
ultimately our success and we want to be

629
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,990
human we want it to feel familiar and

630
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,540
approachable because after all the

631
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,900
people writing your Docs are human -

632
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:29,779
thank you
