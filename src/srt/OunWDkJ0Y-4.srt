1
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,089

so um did I want to expect that I'll

2
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,130
explain how to write a game engine if

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,439
yes then don't worry I'll explain some

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,970
great stuff but not how to write a game

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,470
engine tonight so getting closer H my 5

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,650
gaming in 2011 as Martha already

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,910
mentioned I've done a talk last year and

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,940
this year will be bit more a more closer

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,540
to go first of all me I'm Celia of Sigma

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,270
Germany zigga germany was dextrose

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,399
before and has become Zynga Germany I'm

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,649
the greater of the others engine

13
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,469
prototypes um that I have released last

14
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,949
year went through the Twittersphere lon

15
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:56,340
and Jake we are and i also love shiny

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,410
things so I love getting shipped down

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,359
syke Germany is the first European

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,100
development studio that Zynga has

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,400
created and this is sounds bit cheesy

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,290
but we are really creating the tech of

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,439
the future that's what we're doing we're

22
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,049
doing our emt development over here just

23
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,330
a quick words about a singer whose

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,020
singer singer the world's leading social

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,150
game developer most people connected to

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,549
farmville say the bill and I have to

27
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:31,259
have to tell you that I wasn't a social

28
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,810
gamer before a joint Zynga I was a

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,880
traditional console gamer so I didn't we

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,240
understand social games um and struck me

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,130
that social games can actually reach

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,950
each numbers of people and a very very

33
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,869
different target audience much broader

34
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,479
target audience so we now have more than

35
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,790
60 million daily active players who play

36
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,180
our games and more than 230 million

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,159
monthly active players that we can reach

38
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,680
through those games that's what makes it

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,450
really exciting we also started to be

40
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,310
really global so now our games are

41
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,540
played in over a hundred sixty six

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,670
countries in six in different languages

43
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,970
and what made it really really exciting

44
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,740
to me as

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,570
now if you look at console games you

46
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,280
know they're fun and they played a lot

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,310
but if you look at social games you see

48
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,010
certain pattern right social games if

49
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,870
you look at if you compared to TV you

50
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,090
know our games like cityville and

51
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,300
farmville I actually you know consume

52
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,360
more entertainment time of people's

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,210
lives then popular TV shows like Dancing

54
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,640
with the Stars no American Idol stuff

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,130
like that so it's a great way to reach

56
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,310
of really broad audience well let's get

57
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:47,090
started flashback so first of all in

58
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,940
april 2010 that was the first time where

59
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,640
we showed the others engine prototype

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,970
one so was a the kind of a medieval

61
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,160
world where you know guys were walking

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,060
around stuff like that then that was on

63
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,660
a mac where we displayed it then in june

64
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,570
2010 we did a new prototype that was you

65
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,010
know based in a modern word and most of

66
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,510
all about community it was all about

67
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,520
running a cross-platform so we're a

68
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,030
video that showed it running on ipad and

69
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,300
that was the exciting new scoop there

70
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,300
then in fifa 2011 I realized that

71
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,850
browser games the term browser game is

72
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,310
actually diluted and force founding a

73
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,290
new term called open web games because

74
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,240
that's what we wanted to build we wanted

75
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,610
to build games that are cross-platform

76
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,120
plugin free and run across any device

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,580
and I still have the feeling that we

78
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,800
were running faster than what technology

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,140
could give us so we're running away from

80
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,170
technology as our time and now it's

81
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,650
interesting how it's all develops now so

82
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,170
looking back you know from one and a

83
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,060
half years ago how did it browser tech

84
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,160
evolve and this is you know there's a

85
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,570
lot more stuff that's happening but this

86
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,080
is what really relevant to us so WebGL

87
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,140
let's talk about that first WebGL is

88
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,520
exciting and it's really exciting to us

89
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,910
because it allows us to you know build

90
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,640
stuff in 3d or you know accelerate 2d

91
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,060
stuff in 3d however if you look at the

92
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,269
adoption pattern of web

93
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,400
she'll when child's now almost two years

94
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,639
old um yes actually that also the spec

95
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,819
is really now has made you but the first

96
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:31,590
implementations we saw you know one and

97
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,069
a half years ago so um and still the

98
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,389
only thing we're seeing right now our

99
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,110
demos and not only are some of them are

100
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,909
really cool but they still look like the

101
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,250
demo scene from the 90s and now that can

102
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,680
be really read oh and retro and sexy but

103
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,770
if you want to write a new console you

104
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,960
know console game or something that

105
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,310
looks like a console game something

106
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,319
that's really exciting and attracts

107
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,690
people you know I haven't seen a single

108
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,620
use case for WebGL get that really you

109
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,520
know makes makes a huge huge experience

110
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,409
that's bad and I hope you can see

111
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:10,220
something soon canvas whatever canvas

112
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,780
our canvas is adopted broader than web

113
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,880
shell but we still have to issue that

114
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,699
for now the main use case of canvas

115
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,949
remains being graphs and charts and

116
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:26,729
that's very unfortunate so no canvas has

117
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,169
the advantage that it allows you to do

118
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,520
everything and the downside that it

119
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,860
allows you to do everything and most

120
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,000
people don't most people don't realize

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,490
in the game word is that as soon as you

122
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,310
you know have to manage your scene graph

123
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,099
for drawing yourself and not leave it to

124
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:44,250
the browser um you're moving all this

125
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,840
bottleneck that was on the browser

126
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,630
before in native C code and move it to

127
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,270
JavaScript so now everything's executed

128
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,370
in JavaScript and you have this huge j/s

129
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,710
heap that people you know sometimes can

130
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,479
count do you work and that that's a

131
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,389
problem so still not really deployed

132
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:01,919
widely if you look at you know the top

133
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,500
hundred pages that people use you know

134
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,779
it's really hard to see where face for

135
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,590
where canvas is used now this was from

136
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,210
couple slides that I have published last

137
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,180
year and fortitude is still true audio

138
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,699
is still broken there's still the codec

139
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,580
battle iphone problems you know one

140
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,849
sound at a time weird security model so

141
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,259
you can only activate sound when you

142
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,199
click on something there's still memory

143
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,400
issues and you can't cash sound so

144
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,800
that's not obvious but if you create

145
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,240
cache manifest on your mobile device

146
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,699
there's no way to catch that sound in

147
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,180
there that's a big issue device api's

148
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,030
are still missing so stuff like camera

149
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,509
file system access on mobile devices Oh

150
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,440
everything that we want to play with and

151
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,300
then there's some non obvious stuff like

152
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,610
we have access to the gyroscope for

153
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,979
instance nowadays and an hour in tation

154
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:59,419
change however gyroscope information

155
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,490
right now is completely useless because

156
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,639
you can't prevent orientation from

157
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,220
changing so as soon as you have a ball

158
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,620
and on an iphone if you want to like

159
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,870
rotate your phone to move the ball right

160
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,750
the phone just you know changes its

161
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,150
orientation arbitrary and that's

162
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,970
problematic so those things are not well

163
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,389
thought out yet now this is a big one

164
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:28,039
for me right mobile debugging on mobile

165
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,949
devices it's not there is not existent

166
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,190
there's small parts of it in Android but

167
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,820
not what we need so really you know you

168
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,830
have this great debug extension in

169
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,849
WebKit that most people don't even know

170
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:46,520
about that gives you information of is

171
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,710
something drawn on the GPU or is

172
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,780
something drawn on the cpu gives you

173
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,849
information on memory leaks and memory

174
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:54,650
consumption and all these interesting

175
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,840
information that we need to build a

176
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,270
performant game engine and all of this

177
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,630
we don't have a mobile so it's just you

178
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,520
know really bad now that's all about

179
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,599
bashing let's talk about the good part

180
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,699
so some of you might recognize this one

181
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,130
web could overflow scoring touch that's

182
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,960
amazing because for the first time ever

183
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,940
you know there's a property you can

184
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,060
actually have you know if you want to

185
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,550
construct a a application that has a

186
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,979
fixed hair of fixed footer he would take

187
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,070
the inside content and and do an

188
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,830
overflow overflow auto in there and then

189
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,279
you can flick through and now finally we

190
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,959
can do that so it looks pretty native

191
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,310
web sockets and iOS

192
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,520
so that's also something I I really like

193
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,850
and there's numbers improvements over

194
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,400
web inspector yourself if WebKit is one

195
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,080
of your many level platforms it sucks

196
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,050
that you know back then Firebug was so

197
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,910
much better than the inspector that you

198
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,190
always have to switch back Firebug to

199
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,470
look at what's wrong and nowadays the

200
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,160
web inspector is actually really great

201
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,589
finally you know hardware accelerated

202
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:12,170
hardware accelerated cameras that's a

203
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,720
big one for us um it's really gaining

204
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,580
traction it's a med apart from snow days

205
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,200
so I 9 has it I 10 obviously Firefox

206
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,670
Chrome on vista and windows seven well I

207
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,800
say this I'm window 7 because windows XP

208
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,070
is still a big bottleneck and it's a 551

209
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,540
also has it on line that's very exciting

210
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,990
so that's that's the review that's not a

211
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,750
bit about html5 so html5 is still the

212
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,839
hot new bus as we all know and the way

213
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:46,970
to get hired is to tell you know I'm ha5

214
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,540
developer but what does that mean so one

215
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,550
of the big issues i see with html5 at

216
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,080
this point is this situation so if you

217
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,270
look at iOS 5 you know you see around a

218
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,570
thousand five hundred native api's and

219
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,240
compare it to you around 20 api is on

220
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,790
safari that we we get access to you and

221
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,920
that you know i mean that really says it

222
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,280
all right so we need more api's we need

223
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,580
those camera API is file system API is

224
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,290
we need a lot lot more love bye-bye d

225
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,180
vendors and also html5 you know is

226
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,339
really something that everybody wants

227
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,000
but nobody can get um so it's like this

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,870
nice shoes and that that I mean

229
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,370
basically as I think nobody actually can

230
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,890
plus nobody knows how so every company

231
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,020
wants to jump on the html5 band working

232
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,240
but there's no talent there's no

233
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,370
resources there's no training you know

234
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,279
you can't just Google

235
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,019
this stuff I could just you know Google

236
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,449
no give me an isometric game engine in

237
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,680
JavaScript theory run why is that right

238
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,759
so theory run is good deaths good deaths

239
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,480
don't want to learn html5 so what we we

240
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,089
all have heard that probably see we too

241
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,790
is companies don't have the balls to

242
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,180
ditch and explore smaller than nine and

243
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,300
this is something that I'm particularly

244
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,050
mad about so because you know those

245
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,720
companies will probably argue but you

246
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,220
know a large percent of our users surf

247
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,879
with these process um now there's this

248
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:35,970
nice quote by Steve Jobs and this is a

249
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,100
real exciting part where it says you

250
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,800
know that the TV networks are in

251
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,079
business to give people exactly what

252
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,709
they want and it's very very bad so you

253
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,029
know we think about you know all those

254
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:50,519
crazy channels and then TV programs say

255
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,499
you know this is but this is

256
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:53,930
that people actually want to watch and

257
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,279
there's other TV programs that give

258
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,670
people what's exciting so you know what

259
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,029
we what people would should really think

260
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:05,759
that is traditional game makers you know

261
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,269
make people buy new hardware and those

262
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,160
companies don't have the balls to force

263
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,779
them to update the 10 year old browser

264
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:16,949
and that's bad so we should stop

265
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,290
thinking about you know what can we make

266
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,129
better for ie6 users but really think

267
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:24,779
about how do we have them upgrade their

268
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,769
browsers because it's luxury to just be

269
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,389
able to download free software and

270
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,309
install it you know traditional

271
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,139
traditional game makers didn't have that

272
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,179
luxury they had to buy new hardware go

273
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:37,980
to store to play their games and it

274
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,220
still worked so upgrade the web so it's

275
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,790
still a problem with html5 gaming asian

276
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,480
of 5 was not created with games of mine

277
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,660
the WTC and what we g historically had

278
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,459
no members from gaming companies and

279
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,160
it's telling so there was simply no

280
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,000
focus whatsoever on on gaming also wept

281
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,790
are seldom good game devs and vice versa

282
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,100
that's something I've learned in the

283
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,630
past that's something i learned when

284
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,300
looking at myself i started as a web

285
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,000
developer and only very slowly became a

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,820
game developer and that transition in

287
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,420
any direction takes a lot of time and

288
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,020
that's the third significant issue we

289
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,480
don't have which I des to build build

290
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,100
stuff we had one of the talks mention

291
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,320
that I think the first talked talked

292
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,110
about tools and I totally agree we need

293
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,330
tools the reason why I flashes so

294
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,090
insanely popular is it has great tooling

295
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,610
the slash IDE is really really useful

296
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,510
and we don't have that this IC efforts

297
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,530
being done but we're not there yet so

298
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,470
let's talk a bit about with zynga and

299
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,170
our specific role you know as singer

300
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,660
CIGNA's technician is to make the web a

301
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,970
better place for games that's what we

302
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,370
want to achieve how do we achieve that

303
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,730
well a couple things we do WTC

304
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,680
participation dialogues with browser

305
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,860
vendors game engine development and open

306
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,810
source so WCC are Zynga is a pretty

307
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,150
fresh member of WCC we joined februari

308
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,290
2011 and we started to actively proposed

309
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,260
new specs the stuff in there that seems

310
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,480
non obvious to most people like one of

311
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,270
the things that we proposed was was a

312
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,170
point events opacity proposal where you

313
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,580
could basically say you know take this

314
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,740
opacities threshold on any element and

315
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,960
then make the point events go through

316
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,170
that opacity so imagine you have you

317
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,760
know a element and you want to have

318
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,130
rounded corners on that element if you

319
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,780
hit on the edge of the rounded corner

320
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,640
you still hit the element and that's

321
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,860
stupid we don't want that and for

322
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,780
graphics is more interesting so you have

323
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,480
a house right and you want to be able to

324
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,250
click the house behind that but you're

325
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,839
still on the rectangle of the first

326
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,020
house so those use cases we have all the

327
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,720
time and they can solve a lot of

328
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,940
problems for traditional web companies

329
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,530
well

330
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,480
we are having an open dialogue and very

331
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,060
well exchange with most of the big

332
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,830
browser vendors um so whether it's you

333
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,100
know Google Chrome Firefox Safari or

334
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,180
Internet Explorer it's really important

335
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,310
that we talk to the implementers because

336
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,890
they usually and you can do our two

337
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,720
obviously there's there's no reason why

338
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,840
you can't it's really important to have

339
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,940
a voice and tell them what we need

340
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,250
because they're usually looking they

341
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,020
come from all different perspectives and

342
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,850
they're not necessarily implementing

343
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,250
what's good for you there's sometimes

344
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,680
implementing what's good for them to be

345
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,840
able to do all right so they focus on

346
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,580
the things that they can do quickly and

347
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,550
easily but this point events a positive

348
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,500
thing for instance is really really hard

349
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,990
to do but everyone agrees that is a

350
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,590
great addition so a couple of those

351
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,110
interesting things that we propose block

352
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,600
orientation change multi-channel sound

353
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,330
on iOS mobile device debugging so those

354
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,440
are just some quick examples so that's

355
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,590
that's what we do to bring the web

356
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,680
forward but then finally and this is

357
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,680
probably the most significant point open

358
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,430
source um and this is exciting because I

359
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,560
talked about that a couple months ago

360
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,590
said you know we do have plans

361
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,990
eventually to do open source because we

362
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,370
want to give away something and and

363
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,190
learn from giving it away and really

364
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,440
excited to announce that open source

365
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:55,130
that Zynga starts today

366
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,480
so today for the first time ever you're

367
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,850
getting access to two projects that

368
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,279
we're open sourcing they have been beta

369
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,049
internally for quite some while and we

370
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,750
we think we are now ready to give you a

371
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,870
sneak peek um so today will be will be

372
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,660
soft launching two of four projects that

373
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,299
we want to lounge this year and the two

374
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:18,819
we're launching is view pouria something

375
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,809
i call viewport and scroller jukebox and

376
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,150
speedrun are more focused on actual game

377
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,179
development so they're well sweded for a

378
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,460
different audience will be releasing

379
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,340
them later on so let's talk about

380
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,299
viewport first now imagine you are

381
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,520
running a page on your iPhone and you

382
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,130
want to create a web app right so you

383
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,080
have this blue element that's left

384
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,200
bottom 0 it's red element that's chopped

385
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,480
right zero stretch it up to a middle of

386
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,610
screen and that due to what what you get

387
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,650
right so you do a normal may not view

388
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,169
port um like the thing you learn

389
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:02,020
everywhere and it's what you get but

390
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,210
people want to scroll away this your L

391
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,860
bar that's on top because that your

392
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,900
elbow doesn't need to be there if you

393
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,130
want to play a game or if you want to

394
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,230
maximize your if you don't want to have

395
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,150
to do Alba so this is crazy hack that

396
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,850
everyone knows scroll to 01 on the

397
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,690
window just call away the you elbow now

398
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,710
what keeps happening is this so everyone

399
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,270
who's done mobile development we have

400
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,940
probably have seen this before so the

401
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,429
stuff scrolls up but now left bottom 0

402
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:32,710
is not you know where you expect it

403
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,630
anymore so you have this blank space

404
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,580
here that keeps keep staying there and

405
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,450
euphoria change that so view porter

406
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,980
if your neighbor if you plug in the

407
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,590
viewport a plug-in to your page it will

408
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,830
do that so it will scroll away

409
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,779
everything it can find including debug

410
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:55,510
bars your elbows whatever we're hittin

411
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,640
the if you want to the native resolution

412
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,700
so you can always the speed and pomp

413
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,250
improvement and it will always create

414
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,169
the right viewport dimensions

415
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,200
dynamically on Android and iOS devices

416
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,559
so left bottom 0 is actually left 10

417
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,770
that's what it's all about so it's

418
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,480
around 6k unified iOS and Android

419
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,990
handles orientation change so twisted as

420
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,779
much as you want you I remember we were

421
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:24,940
rotating devices for four weeks or so

422
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,169
was no fun it can also normalized epi

423
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,029
that's pretty exciting so let's say you

424
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:33,940
won't you have a element on screen that

425
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,460
should be you know a centimeter in size

426
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,399
on any device you can do that you can

427
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:43,210
say you know my base DPI is 100 and it

428
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,600
will do 100 on any device so we look the

429
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,750
same on iOS for iphone 4 look the same

430
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,270
on iphone 3gs and any kind of android

431
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,350
phone and can also map device pixels to

432
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,000
screen pixels so that was the important

433
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,549
part for us because that's a huge

434
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:01,960
performance gain so if you trigger the

435
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,520
native resolution on the device you

436
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,620
might have you know some trickiness

437
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,039
around handling layout but it's really

438
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,260
used to be fun so that's URL I will this

439
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,140
is not public yet aftershock I'll give

440
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,360
me 10 minutes I have to see all ready

441
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,100
for you to check out so it's all in get

442
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:28,510
up so next next topic so this is what's

443
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,600
your friends some of you might know it

444
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,059
it's pretty popular in two years what's

445
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:36,309
your friends it's just a traditional you

446
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,799
know looks like a traditional I iOS

447
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,990
application and you have this chopped

448
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,710
fixed header and bottom header and in

449
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,880
the middle there's the game board and

450
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,159
this could be any web app so you know in

451
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,620
the middle you have a every year that

452
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,990
you can scroll right

453
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,670
and in a classical web app you would

454
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,440
probably do position fixed on the top

455
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,420
and the bottom and then have dinner card

456
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,850
and scroll or you do an overflow auto

457
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,090
container in the middle ultimate work

458
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,190
however they never worked on mobile

459
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,030
before and why is that that's because

460
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,640
that's what most people don't realize

461
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,800
panning is not scrolling so on mobile

462
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,440
devices on ios and android and webos

463
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,260
anything that's touch-based you have

464
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,090
this concept of actually panning the

465
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,130
view port rather than scrolling it so

466
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,490
the viewport size is a bigger size than

467
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,030
the device for you know desta optimized

468
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,929
websites and in order to not not cause

469
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:36,059
too many reflow issues they're not

470
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,250
shifting the screen size to be really

471
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,559
tiny their basic allowing you to pen the

472
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,080
whole viewport and panning is in

473
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,640
conflict with sprawling so you couldn't

474
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,090
have both but now there's there's a

475
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,090
couple of companies that tried to fix

476
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,890
this and to private solutions that so

477
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,800
this I scroll that created in JavaScript

478
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,900
ends just as transforms and cradled a

479
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,059
library scroll ability is doing the same

480
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:04,590
I think using CSS animations Google Mail

481
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,980
has it has its own implementation um

482
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,600
actually even Apple has its own

483
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,850
implementation of written in JavaScript

484
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,890
for their mobile web apps which is

485
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,530
hilarious but no that's hence the way

486
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,840
they did too so everyone has to find had

487
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,720
to find a workaround for that because

488
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,670
there was you know you could have of

489
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,559
overflow order before but you would need

490
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,090
you know two fingers to scroll the

491
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,610
content there was no nifty acceleration

492
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,970
or anything now as mentioned already we

493
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,340
got web could overthrow scrolling touch

494
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,580
now and that's awesome it's really full

495
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,770
of win but oh wait um so it's full of

496
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,330
win and really allows you to scroll

497
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,330
really nicely but what about canvas

498
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,610
right let's say I want to do a game

499
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,160
that's on canvas so you have your canvas

500
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,530
screen maximize two hundred percent and

501
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,020
you wants Colin you're right you could

502
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,210
do a 10,000

503
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,669
thousand pixel canvas but i'm pretty

504
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:03,230
sure that you would run into performance

505
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,580
problems here um so for canvas this is

506
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,289
obvious not a solution you need

507
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,200
something if different so meet the

508
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,539
scroller squad is our second plug-in

509
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:15,470
that we're releasing today and we're

510
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,649
really excited about it the squatter is

511
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:20,270
one hundred percent event-driven it's

512
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,000
just logic and it's not applying

513
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,990
anything to the Dom or you know any

514
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,580
values anything that's really related to

515
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,039
lay out that means it can handle dumb

516
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,890
canvas SVG web chair whatever you want

517
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,289
to trample because only what you do is

518
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,840
you tell it that someone started

519
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,210
scrolling if we do all the mathematics

520
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,580
and logic for you and five events so you

521
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,230
can basically say whatever you want to

522
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,570
and modify your scroll values internally

523
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,270
say you know if you have a Dom element

524
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,000
it's as easy as you know sticking CSS

525
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,740
transform values on the element and just

526
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,659
shifting it around the whole logic is

527
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,120
done but applying it handles more than

528
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,909
scrolling so it handled zooming snapping

529
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:04,730
blocking paging because that's also the

530
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,500
things that you can't do with web could

531
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,539
overflow scroll and with the other

532
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:11,870
solutions so on the game board on a

533
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,760
traditional isometric game board like

534
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,130
farmville in cityville you always want

535
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,450
to have to ability to zoom in and out

536
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,520
and that's something god for instance

537
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,260
WebKit overflow scrawling couldn't give

538
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,929
us so again this project is I'll get up

539
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:30,169
later on and feel free to play with it

540
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,970
and we're looking really to a lot of

541
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,789
feedback so that's the scroller and I've

542
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:38,799
got to show you preview right away so

543
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:48,970
let's see

544
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,250
here we go so that is the canvas

545
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,060
implementation of scroller um this is

546
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,640
how to compare around you know it has

547
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,880
locking you can flick it you consume it

548
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,130
you know you can flick and zoom at the

549
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,750
same time but you can do on it on the

550
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:15,450
apple stuff you can have stuff like it's

551
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,770
all program magnet so you have an IP i

552
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,930
right you get all of that us back there

553
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,090
you can do whatever you want with it

554
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,430
enable everything on the fly scrollview

555
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,520
certain coordinates and zoom tool ever

556
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,120
now the good part is that the native

557
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,340
demo so this is native we just wanted to

558
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,710
compare it to the actual a touchpad

559
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:40,290
deaths in LA and Mac OS X scroll demo on

560
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,080
dumb so this is this is done this HTML

561
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,240
looks really excited at the same it's

562
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,570
the same thing it's the exact same logic

563
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,100
you do it for canvas you do it for dom

564
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,570
and the only thing you're doing

565
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,270
differently is the actual applying of

566
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,140
the values um this plugin can do more

567
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,880
than that so for instance we have

568
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,950
snapping in there so let's say you have

569
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,350
those small rectangles and you won't

570
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:10,500
snap to them so here's what's doing it

571
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,320
also does YouTube page so paging

572
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,760
horizontally and paging virtually so

573
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,980
here we go that's the scroller

574
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:30,529
you

575
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,340
so finally I have no idea how much time

576
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,399
I have but finally talked a bit about

577
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:40,870
the future so let's take a look at Ava's

578
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,080
engine and single engine now Alice

579
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,149
engine has been a prototype we threw it

580
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:48,490
away when we started working the real

581
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,620
deal we want to start all over and

582
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,740
credit really performance-driven engine

583
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,289
so what you've seen on the others engine

584
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:58,570
was around 5,200 elements that moves on

585
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,340
the screen or like not even move but

586
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,769
were rendered on the screen and what

587
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:05,559
we're dealing with right now is more

588
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,330
than 4,000 elements on screen that we

589
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,909
render and that my might or might not

590
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:12,580
move around so that's a really big shift

591
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,759
so it's 10x increase of objects stuff is

592
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,340
smaller stuff moves around and speed

593
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,049
real deal so um the what we've realized

594
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:26,529
is when doing the development for over

595
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:30,490
15 years now we realized that we had

596
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,350
some expectations and some assumptions

597
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,419
that we did back then and some of you

598
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,250
might remember me always talking about

599
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,950
how to dumb is the right solution to do

600
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,009
gangs because canvas is too slow and I

601
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:44,139
said I over and over and over now

602
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:48,190
actually it's not true anymore and it's

603
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,830
not it's not true anymore to some extent

604
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,409
but that's really interesting so dumb

605
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:56,740
it's now first of all dumb is now faster

606
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,870
than in HTML so if you create something

607
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,330
in the end of Dom like with native dumb

608
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,100
operations it's faster than playing

609
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,409
supplying stuff in HTML that's something

610
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:07,929
that totally changed from work from two

611
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:09,730
years ago so two years ago I was always

612
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,639
talking about use in HTML wherever you

613
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:15,279
can just put it all out there and this

614
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,950
has changed canvas is now faster than

615
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,129
some dumb in some cases so on iOS 5 i'm

616
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:22,750
pretty sure if you're building a game

617
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,809
canvas will perform faster on windows 7

618
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:29,679
canvas will perform faster there's no

619
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,230
need anymore for external CSS so we have

620
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,330
this technique where we use external CSS

621
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,210
to you know not as much as you know

622
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,610
stuff in the NHL stuff you're rendering

623
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,820
out so now

624
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,190
you can just put all in line CSL inline

625
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,350
CSS on the elements we just work equally

626
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,740
well maybe even better and that's

627
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,440
interesting to us because we really see

628
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,200
the the technology shifting from time to

629
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,470
time and luckily we have been able to

630
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,750
adapt it really which are they so that's

631
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,510
good what our engine what we are we

632
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,250
working on so if you if you work out

633
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,380
something and flash for instance right

634
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,810
you usually have a way to render and

635
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,220
that's it and then you have you know all

636
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,280
kinds of game modules but we have this

637
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,290
technique where we implemented hot

638
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,630
sweating in the engine so we're prepared

639
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,640
for whatever comes up we have all the

640
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,290
engine logic implemented generically

641
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,530
like the scroller but we can hot swept

642
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,260
any renderer at any given time so we can

643
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,870
hot swept to an HTML renderer for

644
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,030
windows XP or switch to canvas render on

645
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,340
Widow 7 or switch to something else on

646
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,280
web shell so that that makes it really

647
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,840
really really flexible so some examples

648
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,560
of craziness that we're doing on the

649
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,810
engine and stuff I'm looking forward to

650
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,780
talk about in the next next couple of

651
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,250
J's comes arrays were way too slow for

652
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,300
us so that's interesting so we have a

653
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,130
lot of loose in our engine we're looping

654
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,220
through a lot of them handling objects

655
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,080
handling what you draw handling what you

656
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,270
animate and we had we actually

657
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,760
implemented a custom linked list on top

658
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,830
of JavaScript that is dramatically

659
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,470
faster than arrays in our use case where

660
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,630
we're insane it inserting a lot of stuff

661
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,880
into the into the list and removing a

662
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,710
lot of stuff dynamically so that's

663
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,230
that's the basic stuff we're doing it

664
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,270
out with any jobs which is really none

665
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:35,130
obvious or depth sorting so every game

666
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,980
has this challenge that you know you

667
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,540
need to sort objects that are behind

668
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,390
others in the correct way so you know if

669
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,610
you have an iso game board obviously you

670
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,850
know this example here looks bad doesn't

671
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:52,440
make sense and this example does so um

672
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,690
you have

673
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,100
as those routines you called depth

674
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,200
soaring and perfect depth sorting

675
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,080
something we've worked on by slicing

676
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,059
images it's really weird and really

677
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,919
wicked and we worked in it for a long

678
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,649
time we have read countless books and

679
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,169
this and none of the books were giving

680
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:11,000
us perfect depth sorting so those are

681
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the kind of problems for trying to solve

682
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,850
and honestly I think we're getting close

683
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,460
but we need help to get the final pieces

684
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,879
done so we're really looking for

685
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:25,220
engineers that can help us please apply

686
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,980
today talk to us if you're looking for

687
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,440
ridiculous J as challenge because we can

688
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,750
certainly give you great challenges and

689
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,450
we really want your single journey so

690
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,600
join the fun visit our booth visit you

691
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,830
know this awesome short URL and other

692
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:57,350
than that see you soon yeah thank you

693
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,100
we got plenty of time for questions and

694
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,510
I'm sure there's going to be lots of

695
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:09,940
them so go ahead hi I also work at a

696
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,580
games company and I know many of the

697
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,809
problems that you talked about are

698
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:16,030
familiar to me I was thinking in terms

699
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,960
of tools where do you think that the

700
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,700
best option could come from do you think

701
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,700
it have come from Adobe and something

702
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,929
ready to flash or something else

703
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:28,150
entirely I'm not correctly I think I

704
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,730
think Adobe we seen Adobe trying to

705
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,480
enter the html5 gaming hi5 space right

706
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,669
and then produce tools I think all of

707
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:39,490
them are very early and now we also see

708
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,770
now companies like unity that already

709
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,580
have a great 3d game ID and bringing the

710
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,049
new platforms like they recently

711
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,970
announced you know having having flash

712
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,919
as their deployment platform so I think

713
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:53,710
those traditional game engines could

714
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,100
could really be be able to port to WebGL

715
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,720
and stuff like that so that's an option

716
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,110
but I think there's also room for IDEs

717
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,970
that work for web engineers right

718
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,159
because I see a lot of web developers

719
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:11,020
that want to enter the game market so

720
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,580
it's just different target audience you

721
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,890
know for traditional game developers

722
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,039
something that unity is great and for

723
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,440
for people like me i would i would

724
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,230
rather wish for a you know I de that

725
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,210
looks a bit like fireworks but it's

726
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,940
really all about games so let's see i

727
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,870
don't know i was a question about the

728
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,940
linked lists you mentioned which are

729
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,970
faster and louder than errors why are

730
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,350
the faster and what are they implemented

731
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,470
on this eres themself the link lists are

732
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,630
I can't talk too much about it because

733
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,549
I'm not the one that implemented it but

734
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:53,669
even if you want to talk about it yeah

735
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,350
what so previously there was always the

736
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,850
problem so we will see there was always

737
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,460
the problem with Jasper performance

738
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,629
being too slow so custom data types

739
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,669
which we you would normally use and C or

740
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:13,220
C++ didn't make any sense because he

741
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,829
always had off creating objects and all

742
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:18,200
staff dynamically at one time what's

743
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,859
wrong well was pretty much destroying

744
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:27,040
all the games you would gain for me yeah

745
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,470
from the algorithm so of course in

746
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,530
linked lists it's pretty much all or one

747
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,899
unless you need random access but but

748
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:37,970
you hardly ever need random access in

749
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,909
our cases so of course having an old one

750
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:44,619
linked as for removal or even well I

751
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:47,119
implemented it so that you could even

752
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,869
have 0 1 contains that's also pretty

753
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:53,450
useful so in the end it's all one was as

754
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,730
0 N and since we have thousands of

755
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,170
objects and stuff in there that

756
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,000
obviously will speed up syncs

757
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:08,640
automatically all right thank you

758
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,589
Heather you mentioned it would be

759
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:13,690
awesome if you could export from unity

760
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,029
which is a great development tool and

761
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:19,210
really nice to to WebGL there was a

762
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,609
project called J 3d which does exactly

763
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:23,650
that it was announced at on games start

764
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,309
like a week ago ok interesting have to

765
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:31,299
check it out thanks well any more

766
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:44,250
questions

767
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,300
do you still use jQuery in your engine

768
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,640
yes as a matter of fact we do wish to

769
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,760
use jQuery um we now Jake where it can

770
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,200
be bottleneck right so you have to be

771
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,020
careful about where to use it um it can

772
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,390
dramatically speed up co-development but

773
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,050
if you have a very hard render loop it

774
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,280
probably doesn't make sense use it in

775
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,640
there so we're trying to replace

776
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,470
instance of jQuery where we have you

777
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,020
know a lot of optimization to do but

778
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,520
we're still using it across the engine

779
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:22,880
so definitely great if there's no more

780
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,860
questions give Paul another round of

781
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:31,820
applause please thank you
