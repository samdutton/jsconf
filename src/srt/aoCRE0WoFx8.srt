00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449

all right Thank You Marci

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,370
so hello Cascadia Jas welcome to this

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,179
talk how many people are feeling drowsy

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,269
after lunch shine some light on these

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,800
people right here we want to make sure

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,220
that I asked a few questions during my

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,189
talk wake people up alright so for the

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,689
next half an hour or so I'm going to

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,490
pretend to know a few things about

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,470
JavaScript but like Marcy said I do

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,630
security research so hopefully you'll go

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,070
along with the facade and not call me

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,079
out if I say something wrong but but I

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,149
spend my time looking at malware and I

15
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,530
thought I could share some of the

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,450
JavaScript malware they've been seeing

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,170
lately on the Internet in the wild so

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,149
this talk is called Raiders or the

19
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,270
JavaScript based malware all right so

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,550
the two important threats that I wanted

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,829
to discuss is an example of a ransomware

22
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,539
that is written entirely in JavaScript

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,359
which is which is something we didn't

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,859
even know could happen as security

25
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,120
researchers because we always see

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,040
ransomware written in C or C++ one of

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,409
those languages right but this

28
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,189
ransomware is written entirely in

29
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,170
JavaScript the second thing the second

30
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,700
important thing we want to discuss was

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,670
crypto jacking and crypto jacking is

32
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,049
proliferating on the Internet and what

33
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,340
we want to discuss a little bit about

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,939
that as well so let's go ahead and get

35
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,950
started a little bit about me a little

36
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,780
bit about a group I work as part of the

37
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,250
security research group at Michigan

38
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,470
State University before I was a PhD

39
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,880
candidate there before I started my PhD

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,009
there I used to do independent

41
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,500
penetration testing so you know finding

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,630
flaws security weaknesses for clients

43
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,070
and then getting them a report at the

44
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,990
end of it so that they can fix the

45
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,229
security holes so I am an active speaker

46
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,549
or security conferences this is the

47
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,899
first time I'm speaking at a conference

48
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,790
which is not a security conference so

49
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,500
this is pretty exciting for me and a

50
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,860
little nerve-wracking but but so this

51
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,299
slide kind of introduces some of the

52
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,259
threats some of the new stories that

53
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,240
I've seen over the past week so these

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,310
are pretty recent so Ransome is not a

55
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,629
ransomware it's not going anywhere

56
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,489
you know financially motivated cyber

57
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,760
criminals love to use rants

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,709
we're encrypted jackin attacks to make

59
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,120
the money and it's not going anywhere

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,950
because because it keeps making them

61
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,209
money so why would they

62
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,480
you know discard of this amazing method

63
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,980
they have to to make money and and

64
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,239
what's new is we is is the JavaScript

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,980
based ransomware that we've just seen so

66
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,310
the the elements of a ransomware before

67
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,079
I go ahead and jump into the JavaScript

68
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,940
based ransomware called Raa ransomware

69
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,049
and focus on the code and the JavaScript

70
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,159
details of the JavaScript involved there

71
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,019
I want to discuss the basic elements of

72
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:48,650
a ransomware

73
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,500
so it starts with an initial entry right

74
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,090
so just like any other infection you

75
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,489
want to gain an entry into the host so

76
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,079
there's a bunch of ways to do that I'm

77
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,519
sure all of you are familiar with social

78
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,159
engineering attacks you know so you know

79
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,450
traditional phishing emails they have a

80
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,250
document attached if you if you get an

81
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,799
unsuspecting you know user to download

82
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:09,049
and double click it then it executes the

83
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,639
malicious functionality on their system

84
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,799
right and then there are other ways that

85
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,079
we've seen recently which they're

86
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,180
they're using which is exporting known

87
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,160
vulnerabilities if you're not updating

88
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,699
your PC's regularly and they also love

89
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:25,310
to exploit weakly secured RDP sessions

90
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,709
or Isis s sessions if you if you haven't

91
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,900
got got a strong password on there and

92
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,780
and that sort of thing so the next thing

93
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,889
they need to do is get an encryption

94
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,019
secret which means that all right they

95
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,629
need to have a unique key per victim if

96
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:40,370
for every infection they need to have a

97
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,010
unique key why because you're a part of

98
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,530
their big ransomware campaign and if

99
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,329
they have the same key for every victim

100
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,329
then vicked once a victim pays let's say

101
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,669
300 dollars for for the ransom and gets

102
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,709
the key back then that key can be shared

103
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:55,760
with the rest of the users and that

104
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,409
neutralizes the entire ransomware

105
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,120
campaign so it's important for them to

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,220
get this unique encryption secret per

107
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,650
victim right and then and then they go

108
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,959
ahead and start with file encryption so

109
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,940
they search for specific file types they

110
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,139
don't want to encrypt dll's

111
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,690
that doesn't do them any good because

112
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,239
you can just restore that but what you

113
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,909
cannot restore which is your personal

114
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:19,010
data so if you don't have a backup right

115
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,769
so they are looking to encrypt docx

116
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,630
xlsx and so that's that sort of thing so

117
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,950
you know they they like to

118
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,750
finally they like to demand ransom which

119
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,430
is usually around $300 in

120
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,590
cryptocurrencies so with the

121
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,210
understanding of the general elements of

122
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,100
ransomware let's take a look at our a

123
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,350
ransomware so this is the first

124
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,450
ransomware like I like I've said that's

125
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,940
written entirely in JavaScript and it

126
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,890
uses the default windows script host no

127
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,260
I did not know that by default Windows

128
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,870
has the windows script host which is a

129
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,580
scripting engine that executes

130
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,210
JavaScript on Windows so if a user so

131
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,590
what they do is they send a phishing

132
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,860
email to a user and the attachment is

133
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,080
something likes something underscore doc

134
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,110
underscored dot je s now the users users

135
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,930
are generally trained to think that it's

136
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,270
normally exe s or executable files that

137
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,560
are malicious so they would they're more

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,300
likely to download a CSV file thinking

139
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,070
that it's benign right so they'll

140
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,080
download it and then double-clicking it

141
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,090
means that windows script host will

142
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,390
execute it all right so now they have

143
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,330
execution capability on host then they

144
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,800
use a bunch of JavaScript obfuscation

145
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
tactics because in case of C and C++ the

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,050
code isn't always visible you have to

147
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,210
the source code is invisible to us as

148
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,280
malware analysts but in case of

149
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,990
JavaScript the source code is right

150
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,450
there so for that reason they want to

151
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,890
make it hard for us to understand what's

152
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,600
going on and for that reason they use a

153
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,070
lot of obfuscation tactics which

154
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,810
basically means they break anything

155
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,400
you've learned about coding standards

156
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,840
and good coding practices they do the

157
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,090
opposite of that so it makes it

158
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,220
difficult to read this one likes to add

159
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,240
insult to injury this is not a primary

160
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,190
functionality of a ransomware but this

161
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,230
one likes to also drop a Trojan in the

162
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,880
background that spies on you and steals

163
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,360
your information so you know no ethics

164
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,750
in the cyber criminal you know in the

165
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,370
cyber criminal world anymore like what's

166
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,070
the world coming to

167
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,130
so these are these are what we call

168
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,290
indicators of compromise which means

169
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,570
these are symptoms of an infection in

170
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,570
the security industry we like to you

171
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,570
know use these as a metric towards okay

172
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,640
do you have this specific and in you

173
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,730
know infection so a primary way to do it

174
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,980
is to look at hashes in this particular

175
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,820
J's file these are the sha

176
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,340
and md5 hashes that are you know that

177
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,660
indicated that okay you're hit with this

178
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,700
particular ransomware then you can look

179
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,350
at dropped files so once it once it

180
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,760
executes on a system you can see the

181
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,290
files it drops in this particular case

182
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,540
it drops st dot exe which is that pony

183
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,360
trojan that steals your information so

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,010
that's another indicator and then

185
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,650
network activity it makes a dns request

186
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,410
to start wave now calm which is its

187
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,820
command and control server i'll be

188
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,930
discussing that in a little bit but

189
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,100
that's where it goes to for commands so

190
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,020
once you execute this what i'm going to

191
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,700
do is i'm going to show you the system

192
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,800
impact and then I'll discuss the

193
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,570
JavaScript code that leads to that

194
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,720
system impact so this is the process

195
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,930
graph once you execute it W script exe

196
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,490
is the window scripting host that I was

197
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,670
talking about and that basically creates

198
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,630
two processes WordPad exe and st dot exe

199
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,630
SC dot exe is the Tony the pony Trojan

200
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,490
that I was talking about and warpath dot

201
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,440
exe just puts a diversion screen in

202
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,450
front of your face which distracts you

203
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,070
while it's executing malicious

204
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,920
functionality in the background so this

205
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,890
is the example this is that divergence

206
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,020
screen that I was talking about it's in

207
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,160
Russian you know a big surprise there

208
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,940
it's so this is an error code they are

209
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,970
basically telling users that you know

210
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,670
this particular version of Microsoft

211
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,860
Word or whatever cannot open this

212
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,440
document for this reason so while you're

213
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,820
busy dealing with that and while you're

214
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,600
trying to click close it jumps around so

215
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,310
when you try to get to the close button

216
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,570
it jumps around so while you're trying

217
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,040
to figure out how can I close this

218
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,080
particular window it execute malicious

219
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,860
functionality in the background so and

220
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,210
it doesn't need a lot of time to do that

221
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,980
a few seconds is enough a network

222
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,650
activity in the meanwhile you know in

223
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,450
the in the meantime network activity

224
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,650
something like this it makes several

225
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,320
requests to DNS requests to start wave

226
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,570
now calm which is its command and

227
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,430
control server and it's the potential

228
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,110
source of the unique encryption key that

229
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,430
I was talking about when I was talking

230
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,110
about the primary elements of ransomware

231
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,970
so that's where it acquires this unique

232
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,880
encryption key from right but the CNC

233
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,270
server

234
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,330
in case of many of these infections the

235
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,300
malicious domains get

236
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,010
taken down obviously once they're

237
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,529
recognized so this particular CNC server

238
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:57,000
has been taken down now so we can't

239
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,620
really study what response it gets back

240
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,510
to from the server anymore but if you

241
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,000
look at the code so two of the things

242
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,980
that I didn't show was it then encrypts

243
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,050
the files so if it let's say if it found

244
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,050
your docx or your xlsx it will then

245
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,550
replace that with an encrypted version

246
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,430
and then what it will do next is you

247
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,529
know have a ransom note in every folder

248
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,470
of your computer so you know because

249
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,120
having a ransom note on one computer

250
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,959
isn't enough so it's on one folder isn't

251
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,180
enough so it just goes ahead and in

252
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,430
every folder you have you've got on your

253
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,839
computer it will put a ransom note up

254
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,790
there so so crypto j/s library is a big

255
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,279
part of this ransomware we've seen that

256
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,709
ransomware developers are at coding

257
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:50,640
so well so what they do is they engage

258
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,140
in a lot of cargo called programming

259
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,490
they steal code from each other they

260
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,610
copy paste code from let's say wiki CPP

261
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,370
and things like that so they already

262
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,010
can't get many things right so why would

263
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,450
they want to implement crypto

264
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,740
functionality from scratch because

265
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,779
there's a lot of room for error there so

266
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,070
what they do is they use some kind of

267
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,020
cryptographic library in this particular

268
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,149
case they use the crypto JS library so

269
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,370
the first 800 lines of this ransomware

270
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,980
contains the crypto J's code has just

271
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,160
copy paste in so that's where it gets

272
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,110
its crypto functionality from now the

273
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,950
next part is the the diversion message

274
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,990
so the the message that I showed you on

275
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,120
the screen on WordPad Exe in Russian

276
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,010
that comes from here so if you look at

277
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,440
this part right here by the way also

278
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,899
notice the code obfuscation here the

279
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,279
function names and the variable names

280
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,380
there they're very difficult to read

281
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,490
they're just a bunch of random

282
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,610
characters so that makes it hard for you

283
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,640
to follow along with their code so in

284
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,040
this particular function this variable

285
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,290
holds a long string which is you know

286
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,649
then basics before decoded and then it

287
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,339
drops this particular you know decoded

288
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,040
string in my documents then creates this

289
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,990
doc underscore attached underscore a

290
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,740
random story

291
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,680
and and then puts it in front of your

292
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,920
face by opening WordPad exe and pasting

293
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,170
this on there so that's what that

294
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,290
diversion screen was all right so then

295
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,390
we talked about decrypting the pony

296
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,290
Trojan because like I said st dot exe is

297
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,880
pertains to the pony trojan that spies

298
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,029
on your information right so this

299
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:28,800
function is responsible for creating

300
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,120
that and this is pretty impressive

301
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,800
because they use JavaScript to create a

302
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,550
binary executable file by and by

303
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,339
encoding and encrypting the whole binary

304
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,070
in the in string format in there so it's

305
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,529
hard coded in there so what it does is

306
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,230
this is the this is a very long string

307
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,540
by the way it's truncated over here but

308
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,190
it's a very long string which contains

309
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,660
the entire code for Pony Trojan and then

310
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,020
and then it decrypt it by using the AES

311
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,450
encryption algorithm or decryption

312
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,149
algorithm and then and then the the key

313
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:04,890
for that is also encoded as part of the

314
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,649
ransomware and then it uses that eval

315
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:10,380
command to basically get to this point

316
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,320
so that eval evaluates to over here and

317
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,270
so this is what it evaluates to and this

318
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,630
is what drops the Pony Trojan where it

319
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,790
goes in the my documents' creates that

320
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,770
file SP dot exe which is the Trojan and

321
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:29,990
care set 437 pertains to well it lets it

322
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,900
figure out how to handle this executable

323
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,420
binary data in string formats so that's

324
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,560
what that pertains to you'll see that

325
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,510
throughout this ransomware is code and

326
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,740
then you see write text safety file

327
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,940
close that file

328
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,190
so obviously it's creating that file now

329
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,770
on in the My Documents folder and then

330
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,720
finally it runs the file so now the

331
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,610
trojan is executing on your computer

332
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,770
next thing it needs to do is now it

333
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,990
needs to actually perform its ransomware

334
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,610
functionality which is to encrypt drives

335
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,550
so to do that what it does is it uses

336
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,670
the basic object available as part of

337
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,459
the windows script host to create to go

338
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:09,810
through the drives and enumerate the

339
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,940
drives dry letters and then access

340
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,890
different files and folders and you know

341
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,120
source through the files and their

342
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,560
extensions to know which files to

343
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,820
encrypt and so on

344
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,710
so you'll see things like this else

345
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,170
continue and then there's this is the

346
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,600
equivalent of a go-to statement you know

347
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,090
and this makes this code further

348
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,950
complicated to understand because this

349
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,780
makes it a spaghetti code if they have a

350
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,880
bunch of random go-to jumps at random

351
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,250
spots it makes this hard to follow along

352
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,270
the the execution flow of their of their

353
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,690
bite of their code so further off the

354
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,180
station tactics that these the ransom

355
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,030
note comes from here and and then this

356
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,200
pertains to encrypting the users files

357
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,110
which which means that this particular

358
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,490
function right here calls this function

359
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,850
in a loop once for every file that it

360
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,520
wants to encrypt so this particular

361
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,900
function that is called in the loop

362
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,960
within the other function will be

363
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,370
encrypting each and every file going

364
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,170
through deriving functionality from the

365
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,970
crypto jeaious library that's that I

366
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,040
showed you in the beginning and you know

367
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,230
they use the AES encryption algorithm to

368
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,770
do this so a quick summary you know it

369
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,890
obviously encrypts files on the user's

370
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,830
computer on the user's computer but it

371
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,200
also deletes VSS files what I didn't

372
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,060
show you for the sake of brevity is it

373
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,100
also performs certain other tasks like

374
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,170
deleting VSS files these are volumes

375
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,520
shadow copies that are maintained on

376
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,580
windows so you know you can use Windows

377
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,130
Restore to restore to an earlier point

378
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,130
so if you do that obviously ransomware

379
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,620
has lost its leverage on you so what

380
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,210
what they like to do is make sure they

381
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,590
eliminate any backups in any form so

382
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,870
because of that they want to get rid of

383
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,050
those VSS volume shadow copies so it

384
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,630
likes to do that as well like I said it

385
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:08,990
drops

386
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,240
you know the the Trojan horse which is

387
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,840
not which is not really something every

388
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,440
ransomware does but this one does so so

389
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,880
that's unique to this ransomware and and

390
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,160
the Trojan is dropped in My Documents

391
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,680
folder so you know in in summary it was

392
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,700
very interesting for us as

393
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,190
to see that there's a ransomware now

394
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,360
written entirely in JavaScript I mean

395
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,800
who knew that JavaScript is a full-blown

396
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,230
programming language you know so that so

397
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,450
the next threat is scripted right Jackie

398
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,070
and I want to quickly touch upon this as

399
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,360
well because this is the second biggest

400
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,300
thing we're seeing in 2018 so ransomware

401
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,670
has been you know continuing since 2005

402
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,320
2006 is when it took off and now it's

403
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,900
steadily growing right but cryptid

404
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,320
jacking took off after following the

405
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,670
rise in the valuation of

406
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,050
cryptocurrencies so around the end of

407
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,640
2017 Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

408
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,480
took off and and so of course it took

409
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,430
other cryptocurrencies like maneras

410
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,220
valuation up with it and then we are

411
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,020
introduced to web crypto jacking and and

412
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,460
it's the unauthorized use of processing

413
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,630
power and electricity to mine

414
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,860
cryptocurrencies so if you go on a

415
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,960
website I'll show you the web examples

416
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,060
of this because that is more relevant to

417
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,150
JavaScript and so so the web-based

418
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,460
examples of this would be something like

419
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,480
this where you'll go on a website and if

420
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,010
you look through the source code you'll

421
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,200
see a little script being called from

422
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,000
coin Hyper's of particular is a popular

423
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,480
source for these scripts where they'll

424
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,400
import the script from coin hive and it

425
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,070
will initiate a coin hive instance in

426
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,450
the browser and that is the that that

427
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,830
number that unique string you see in the

428
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,320
box is the ID of the attacker and that

429
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,660
is where you know it credits all the all

430
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,930
the money so you mind you're basically

431
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,579
mining for someone else while you're

432
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,410
visiting this web page so you can see

433
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,480
how it can get lucrative if you have

434
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,209
thousands and thousands of visitors

435
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,970
visiting on your website and say staying

436
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,610
on that web page for a long amount of

437
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,980
time so how do you do that how do you do

438
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,310
that

439
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,470
you you just you just give that you just

440
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,600
tell them that there's like HD porn free

441
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,300
HD porn on this on this link and people

442
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,060
will click it's amazing so you know

443
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,730
so here we go

444
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,130
so you know scripts as seen on the

445
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,870
crypto jackin websites more examples of

446
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,210
that this one is an example with crypto

447
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,590
loot doing the same thing so it's not

448
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,030
just coin hive it's sometimes also

449
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,890
crypto loot and there's other sources as

450
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,130
well so what are the impact on on system

451
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,630
resources alright we did a little

452
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,760
experiment just to see how much what

453
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,020
they do and this was when this threat

454
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,340
was very new so just the beginning of

455
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,310
2018 so you know that's the that's the

456
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,900
before and after shot and you know

457
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,940
before you see that the course you know

458
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,530
that this the computer is at normal

459
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,050
usage and then you visit one website you

460
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,210
know one webpage with with this crypto

461
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,190
jacking script enabled in the background

462
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,380
and you see that all four cores are not

463
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,930
being used 200 percent of their capacity

464
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:20,180
and the CPU temperature rises and and if

465
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,460
you look at the top process is the web

466
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,830
content that's draining ninety seven

467
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,480
point five percent of your CPU power

468
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,730
right now which is you know kind of

469
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,860
stupid of them because this makes it

470
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,740
really easy to notice but they'll get

471
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,900
cleverer and that's what that's what the

472
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,580
problem is that is they're they're in a

473
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,530
learning phase right now at least as far

474
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,120
as crypto jacking attacks are concerned

475
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,210
so they will figure out that it's better

476
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,280
to mine slower and you know get away

477
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,940
with it for a long duration than to do

478
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,530
something like this where you'll

479
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,760
probably notice it pretty quickly

480
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,230
because your computer slows down as well

481
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,210
you know you're draining electricity and

482
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,670
you know that sort of thing so you know

483
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,930
it this is more obvious then we see

484
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,970
examples like this so in this particular

485
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,770
case if you look at the source code of

486
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,410
the website you won't really see right

487
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,690
away where the cryptid jacking script is

488
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,130
hidden so if you're looking for coin

489
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,900
high or crypto loot or some one of those

490
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,060
other you know miners you won't really

491
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,400
see it right away but there's that eval

492
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,340
function again I I recently read

493
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,950
something about evil isn't evil it's

494
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,990
just misunderstood yeah right you know I

495
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,300
see see it and ransomware seen in crypto

496
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,870
jackin so so this is the this is that

497
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,200
eval function taken from the taken from

498
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,330
the source code and this is what it

499
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,340
evaluates to so again as you can see

500
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,470
it's it's the it's the same old coin

501
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,820
hive script that is

502
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,740
porting and mining on people's computer

503
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,130
and and the problem with this is that

504
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,370
now if you want to help by writing a

505
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,500
crawler or something that crawls the web

506
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,750
looking for different cryptid jacking

507
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,460
websites and let's say that the string

508
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,870
you put in there is look for coin hive

509
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,910
in crypto loot and things like that this

510
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,260
makes it harder for you to get there

511
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,000
because you know now that now it's

512
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,560
hidden behind this eval statements how

513
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,120
would you write that curie you know how

514
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,730
would you how would you make an

515
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,340
automatic analysis towards you know if

516
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,950
if there's you know crypto jacking on

517
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,870
this website or not so that that makes

518
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,840
it a little more complicated so I did a

519
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,180
preliminary analysis basically I was

520
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,400
looking to crawl the internet looking

521
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,010
for what websites are involved encrypted

522
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,530
jacking and that sort of thing it didn't

523
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,090
go very well because there's a lot a lot

524
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,130
of roadblocks but what I was able to do

525
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,320
is identify using my automated analysis

526
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,970
identify 212 websites in Walled

527
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,160
encrypted jacking and what I wanted to

528
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,680
do is resolve these categories resolve

529
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,300
these websites to category see what kind

530
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,460
of categories are involved more likely

531
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,140
to get in Walled encrypted jackin so if

532
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,910
you visit a website and it's crypto

533
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,800
jackin is it a pornographic website or

534
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,080
you know is it a is it already serving

535
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,270
other kinds of malware or what kind of

536
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,370
website is that so for that i used for

537
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,940
40 guard has 40 guard web filter

538
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,620
categorizes websites in several

539
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,430
categories like you know pornography and

540
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,590
you see the examples in that little

541
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,560
chart i'm showing so so what it does is

542
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,690
curies so that little python script on

543
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,970
the right it Curie's the 40 guard server

544
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,460
for a particular websites once I've

545
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,870
determined that this website is cryptid

546
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,700
jacking then I resolve it to a

547
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,740
particular category and then see how

548
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,140
many we can find you know a lot a lot of

549
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,810
them in already are malicious websites a

550
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,600
lot of them are pornography websites and

551
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,450
that sort of thing but there's a lot of

552
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,590
problems like I said during this

553
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,810
analysis because you how do you crawl

554
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,910
the web that's a big task so for that

555
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,420
what I did was I utilized public.www

556
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,370
nerdy data senses they've already got

557
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,320
caches maintained where they because

558
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,550
they already have crawlers that are

559
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,660
crawling the the internet looking for

560
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,800
webpages and they're looking at web

561
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,720
pages and their source codes so if you

562
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,620
just Curie their cache

563
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,970
you don't have to write it on crawler

564
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,170
which was take which would take forever

565
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,200
so okay we can kind of get away with

566
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,420
doing that but how how do we determine

567
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,920
the unauthorized part doing this

568
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,940
automated automated analysis right

569
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,130
because there's legitimate uses of

570
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,800
cryptocurrency mining on a webpage for

571
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
example there's an example of a website

572
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,510
where they're asking to donate to

573
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,850
charity by clicking on you know Stark

574
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,710
mining and then staying on that page and

575
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,720
you can then donate money to charity

576
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,000
that way so we obviously don't want to

577
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,920
include that on the cryptid jacking so

578
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,179
how do we determine the unauthorized

579
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:34,400
part that requires manual analysis to

580
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,440
see if they're seeking permission from

581
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,120
the user somewhere so that makes it more

582
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,880
complicated so then how do we validate

583
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,650
the results some websites are now and

584
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,050
available so you can some websites have

585
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,330
cleaned their source code so an

586
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,010
obfuscation how do we get around code

587
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,360
obfuscation like I showed that eval

588
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,070
statement so if you're just looking for

589
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,780
coin hive or crypto loot scripts or

590
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,700
things like that then you know if

591
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,800
they've got a they've got a clever eval

592
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,210
statement over there then it doesn't

593
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,740
work that way so maybe there's another

594
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,750
better way of doing this that you know

595
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,410
you guys can figure out so you know in

596
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:10,970
in conclusion there's probably better

597
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,190
ways to discover crypto jacking websites

598
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,070
on the on the Internet this is not

599
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,440
really my area to write you know a lot

600
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,900
of web crawling scripts and you know

601
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,460
determining maybe there's a better way

602
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,020
that you guys can think of and talk to

603
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,140
me about of doing this and you know

604
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,179
maybe we can protect our users better so

605
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,679
you know some people are coming with

606
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:32,480
coming up with browser based extensions

607
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,880
that automatically block all

608
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,160
cryptocurrency mining and but they don't

609
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,710
always work so there's maybe you know

610
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,320
some room there for improvement and we

611
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,820
have to stay a step ahead of the

612
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,500
attackers because that's what we do in

613
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,730
the security industry is the constant

614
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,090
cat-and-mouse game and so we have to

615
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,429
determine like this windows script using

616
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:53,840
the windows script host to execute a

617
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,880
JavaScript based malware is something we

618
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,800
did not really see coming so what are

619
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,179
the other possibilities where they can

620
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:00,710
use you know JavaScript for malicious

621
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,150
purposes because if we can figure that

622
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,470
out ahead of time then we can maybe

623
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,480
think about you know working around that

624
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,070
so and like I said before the cleverer

625
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,720
ransom

626
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,490
we're encrypted jackin attacks or the

627
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,830
future where they won't mind hundred

628
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,110
percent you know 100 percent of your CPU

629
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,350
they'll be more subtle and sometimes

630
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,820
we've seen instances where what they do

631
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,600
is they open up a so when you go to a

632
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,820
particular website and they're cryptic

633
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,429
jackin you they open us a window in the

634
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:32,350
background and then they make it really

635
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,720
small and they hide it under the under

636
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,789
the taskbar next to the next to the

637
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:39,940
clock and and so even if you close the

638
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,150
original webpage or used that other

639
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,100
webpage is still open and continuously

640
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,350
mining and you never notice it so until

641
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,190
the next time you shut down your

642
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,409
computer that's mining for them so

643
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:52,210
they're getting more cleverer by the day

644
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,640
so we want us to stay a step ahead of

645
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,280
them so yeah if you've got any ideas you

646
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,230
know please get in touch and this is

647
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,270
just a quick introduction to you know

648
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,419
two big problems and and I would love to

649
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,130
talk to you more about that so thank you
