00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,569
doing

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,950
hmm so before we get started I'll give

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,110
you a little bit background I guess I

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,240
will not so I will not do so good as

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,250
Paul did but um my name is Mauricio

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,800
Palma I was born and raised in the

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,529
beautiful country of Costa Rica and I've

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,650
been living for the past 13 years in

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,859
Hamburg Germany

12
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:31,399
not because of the lovely weather Eddie

13
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,760
it is an amazing city don't get me wrong

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,800
I work as a product engineer at

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,820
sahasrara and you will see me also

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,440
wearing multiple hats as the co-founder

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,860
of would like ocean where we craft swim

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,850
or out of ocean recovery fishing nets I

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,410
have to warn you though this

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,600
presentation is going to be filled with

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,359
personal anecdotes so be ready and the

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,409
first story is about how I gave my very

23
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,659
first conference talk it was the

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,600
diseases called Budapest two years ago

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
and I just have found out that David

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,540
yesterday said on the CSS Cohn he did

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,350
his first top two here four years ago so

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,439
today it is a very special humbling

29
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,509
moment for me and I'm so happy to share

30
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,960
it with you if you have ever held a talk

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,020
before the first time it is a very

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,950
exciting nerve nerve wracking experience

33
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,829
and as you can imagine I was super super

34
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,189
nervous I thought I was gonna die

35
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:42,240
especially because all these amazing

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,270
people then some of the speakers you

37
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,540
have followed during your career and I

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,750
can't forget how Dennis mission of came

39
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,540
to me and gave me some really comforting

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,119
words and I think I had just this

41
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,049
terrifying look in my face probably but

42
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,780
I did my best then and I think the

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,530
presentation came all right but my point

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,560
here is this is a very special

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,800
conference and I am very very

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,930
excited to be here and share this

47
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,510
presentation with you if you have your

48
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,000
own ideas if you want your voice to be

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,760
heard this is the best platform to do it

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,510
so submit your ideas and you will never

51
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,890
forget regret it

52
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,160
and for that reason I want to thank the

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,640
organizers for having me I want to thank

54
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,460
you for being part of this amazing

55
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,670
community and I hope that we can use

56
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,450
next two days to get inspired to meet

57
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,540
each other to learn new things and for

58
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,760
that I hope let's give it up for that

59
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,200
[Applause]

60
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,320
the web can be an amazing place a place

61
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,180
where we can collaborate where we can

62
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,140
learn where we can be creative and it

63
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,300
has an inherent open nature to it

64
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,610
information is accessible to everyone

65
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,610
and for me was especially important

66
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,400
because I'm a self-taught front-end

67
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,459
developer now by race of hands how many

68
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,360
of you are self-taught developers that's

69
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,570
a lot of us and now imagine this

70
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,630
information would be only accessible to

71
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,360
a certain amount of people that you were

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,540
not invited to be part of it and this is

73
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,820
actually what we're doing every single

74
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,100
day when we're not thinking about

75
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,350
accessibility and the applications will

76
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,730
build in today we want to invite and

77
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,640
empower people through emerging web

78
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,050
technologies and I love being a front

79
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,739
developer I love my craft and working

80
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,860
with the latest technologies learning

81
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,560
about new paradigms and bringing

82
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,790
projects to life

83
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,060
and I think we share the same passion

84
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,910
but what I have learned in later years

85
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,730
is that my work should serve a higher

86
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,410
purpose that just my own gratification

87
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,680
and I know web accessibility is not an

88
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,260
easy endeavor especially if you're

89
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,930
working on large-scale projects with a

90
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,870
lot of decision makers can become a real

91
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,400
challenge you get to hear stuff like

92
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,690
accessibility it's not important for us

93
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,420
it's not relevant for our target market

94
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,400
and these kind of comments are

95
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,000
frustrating and yet it is still our

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,340
responsibility to remove these barriers

97
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,820
to teach people and try to promote and

98
00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:00,430
implement accessibility we as developers

99
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,980
have a collective responsibility for the

100
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,840
Caleta for the applications we were

101
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,450
building today even if we are aware of

102
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,500
it or not think about it for a second

103
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,850
most of us have seen hundreds thousands

104
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,250
of websites have gone through a ton of

105
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,700
user flows and we have this toolbox full

106
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,620
with buzzwords and my point here is it

107
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,260
doesn't matter how badly design a user

108
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,630
interface is we still make our way out

109
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,030
but this is not how the rest of the

110
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,130
world is interacting with the

111
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,950
applications widow not at all

112
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,690
we are working in a bubble trapped in

113
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:54,170
our own bias and like I mentioned a lot

114
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,330
of personal anecdotes but don't worry we

115
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,940
have some technical stuff too

116
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,570
there were two events in my life that

117
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,870
made me realize about the importance of

118
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,020
accessibility so I had to learn the hard

119
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,560
way and the first one was a painful one

120
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,090
a family health issue my uncle in law he

121
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,020
was found on the floor dehydrated and

122
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,720
unconscious and he was probably on the

123
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,900
floor for a couple of days so today

124
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,320
we're very happy that he's back home but

125
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,420
you have to consider that he's an

126
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,950
elderly person

127
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,650
leaving by himself so before the

128
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,500
accident he completely relied on the web

129
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,620
to get pretty much everything done he

130
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,530
will buy his groceries online pastries

131
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,260
would be order for cut family coffee

132
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,900
dates he will take care of his bills and

133
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,240
finances and unfortunately after the

134
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,900
person after his hospital release he

135
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,850
know he was diagnosed with with poor

136
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,880
vision and memory loss

137
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,910
and after he release he called me and he

138
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,620
said Modi see I think my computer is

139
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,630
broken you know that when computers are

140
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,870
broken family are calling normal stuff

141
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,730
and as I'm trying to order some

142
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,100
groceries and I think my computer is

143
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,920
broken so I went over there to see what

144
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,700
was the problem

145
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,060
and so his computer was working just

146
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,540
fine and I asked him can you please show

147
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,030
me the problem and this is the moment

148
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,180
that I realized and I will never forget

149
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,850
he couldn't recognize and Add to Cart

150
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,360
button he couldn't recognize or

151
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,540
differentiate between copy text or input

152
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,700
fields he could neither gave to release

153
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,240
ID at all and I was very sad because I

154
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,140
realized that I swapped developer was

155
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,150
not being responsible enough with the

156
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,700
applications I was building until that

157
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:15,910
moment

158
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,450
but we can actually make better use of

159
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,150
the current accessibility tools to help

160
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,030
people like my uncle in law get things

161
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,750
done online we can even go further

162
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,270
further and think about all these web AP

163
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,570
is that we can use to our advantage to

164
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,590
actually make the web a more open place

165
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,740
but what I have observed among us

166
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,380
developers sometimes is that

167
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,320
accessibility is perceived as just a

168
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,160
checklist a list of things given by the

169
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,610
web content accessibility guidelines for

170
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,520
us to implement and it reminds me a lot

171
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,710
to the same attitude we have for

172
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,010
front-end developer for alders front-end

173
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,860
development for all their browsers you

174
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,390
know when you have been working on a

175
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,510
project and the time has come for you to

176
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,620
check it in an older internet explorer

177
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,520
think about it for a second and and my

178
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,190
conclusion to that is that we as humans

179
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,650
we tend to avoid things that we don't

180
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,770
understand and that's our nature and I

181
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,720
think that's why accessibility is being

182
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,920
perceived that way but what if we start

183
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,830
considering accessibility as the core

184
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,520
concern of our application now let me

185
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,580
give you an example in Europe alone

186
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,380
there are 30 4.4 million people I mean

187
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,750
let me correct that adults with

188
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,800
disabling hearing impairments a

189
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,750
disabling hearing impairment it is one

190
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,730
that is greater than 35 decibels and

191
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,850
every single day we denied deaf and

192
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,780
hard-of-hearing people access to our

193
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,050
personal and professional lives and

194
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,470
during my research I found this app

195
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,200
called Ava that I would like to show you

196
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,260
and I think the team challenge this

197
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,850
notion with their work

198
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,600
and let me show you what they're doing I

199
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:40,870
am

200
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,790
one day is too many people down this can

201
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:56,710
get really tough

202
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,840
people talk so fast it can be pretty

203
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,350
overwhelming

204
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,749
there's too much going on

205
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,610
ava is awesome to see what people say

206
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,889
with one tap I invite people and they

207
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:27,750
join me with their phones

208
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,920
I knew Ava to attend meetings at what

209
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,740
follow what the teacher says in class

210
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,520
[Music]

211
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,010
what kind of sound people Wendover got

212
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,530
to look at me

213
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,410
baby I will transfer about anything

214
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:53,690
oh well almost everything

215
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,740
and that for me was very inspiring I'm

216
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,480
not related to them I don't even know

217
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,340
the team but I think that's a really

218
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,120
good example of when you recognize

219
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,950
exclusion and you be and you become

220
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,970
empathetic towards people with death and

221
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,310
hearing impairments then they were able

222
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,070
to come up with a meaningful solution

223
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,510
maybe it's not the best one but it is a

224
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,850
good start and that's why we're here

225
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,300
talking about it today because we can do

226
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,310
this kind of things on the web natively

227
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:28,380
and I mentioned two events this is the

228
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,340
last one I promise and the second one I

229
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,220
had a sport injury so I dislocated my

230
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,830
arm I couldn't move my arm for a couple

231
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,260
of weeks and that was really frustrating

232
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,510
in a way because I couldn't interact

233
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,630
with my environment so this becomes a

234
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,620
disability yet I was feeling super fit

235
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,410
and I wanted to work and this is how I

236
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,500
discovered the Mac dictation keyboard

237
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,020
tool now how many of you are you

238
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,980
familiar with the dictation tool a few

239
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,630
of them do you like it yes mixed

240
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,930
emotions well I love it I recognize that

241
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,760
there is so much potential in in the web

242
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,970
speech API it allows to control web

243
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,300
applications through voice and we can

244
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,430
open through that for example our

245
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,580
applications to a lot of other people we

246
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,830
can be inclusive towards people with

247
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,110
vision impairments we can be inclusive

248
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,170
towards people with literacy problems or

249
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,700
maybe with up with the disability with

250
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,300
with a permanent disability if you have

251
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,070
heard of it before it has been around

252
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,760
since 2014 and it has been big natively

253
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,870
into the web and we will be covering

254
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,560
how to include voice in a demo in a

255
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,210
small application I wrote for this

256
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,150
example and considering accessibility

257
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,270
and inclusion as the core concerns of

258
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,390
the application and what this little toy

259
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,320
application does is it pretty much it's

260
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,990
JavaScript application and gets all of

261
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,360
my Spotify playlists so I can navigate

262
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,550
through them play tracks or or manage my

263
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,240
devices through the Kinect Web API from

264
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,370
Spotify which is pretty neat and to

265
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,060
include it the speech recognition

266
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,070
service works pretty much I have a very

267
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,320
funky looking microphone that you will

268
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,230
see you soon it receives sound through

269
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,560
your devices microphone and it checks it

270
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,080
against the list of provided grammars

271
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,140
and that's basically what we need to get

272
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,920
that running now a word of caution is

273
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,850
that the speech recognition involves a

274
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,420
server-based

275
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,360
recognition engine meaning that audio

276
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,370
will be sent to a web service for

277
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,220
processing so this is important to have

278
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,270
in mind because it would only work if

279
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,060
we're online and for that reason I have

280
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,060
a hotspot open because maybe our Wi-Fi

281
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,530
might not be that good so this is the

282
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,600
initial configuration very

283
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,030
straightforward we just instead make an

284
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,890
instance of the speech recognition

285
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,330
controller we configure the max

286
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,150
alternatives and the interesting thing

287
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,270
about it per default is actually one but

288
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,160
the interesting thing about it it let us

289
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,910
define how many words or just one word

290
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,850
or the list an array of words for the

291
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,920
service to give us back for us to work

292
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,780
with it so it gives us a lot of

293
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,760
flexibility with the kind of stuff we

294
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,030
can do we have higher property interim

295
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,420
results which will give us the the

296
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,190
results that are not final yet now like

297
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,920
I mentioned ok lack property is really

298
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,720
important

299
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,050
so if you don't define a length property

300
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:14,330
it will use the HTML tag attribute as

301
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,810
default or as a last default would be

302
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,570
the user agent language settings and as

303
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,580
I mentioned grammar is going to be one

304
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,500
of the most important aspects of this

305
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,900
implementation and the speech grammar

306
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,370
list represents an object of grammars

307
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,250
and uterine cies and patterns for the

308
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,720
service to understand so looking back to

309
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,120
that instantiation function you will see

310
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,950
that we will pass those uterine psa's

311
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,610
which means spoken words necessary for

312
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,040
the recognition I am using rxjs

313
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,260
observables we will not cover them in

314
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,080
detail but it helps me a lot with a lot

315
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,090
of data streams that we're handling and

316
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,180
the difference is that instead of

317
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,980
receiving them all at once we can

318
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,199
receive them over time so it is very

319
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,449
useful for this for this purpose and we

320
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,230
will subscribe to it and pass to the app

321
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,130
from string method the grammars and a

322
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,439
confidence score right now is just

323
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,069
statically one but as you can imagine

324
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,820
the can we can tell by every search how

325
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,080
important is this search for us and at

326
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,550
the end we'll pass it to the speech

327
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,530
recognition itself excuse me

328
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:49,519
that's very hot up here

329
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:52,059
so I mentioned grammars are super

330
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,190
important and for that we need to take a

331
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,720
look at NLP an NLP or natural language

332
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,869
processing is the field that focuses in

333
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:04,059
the interaction between human language

334
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:07,090
and computers so what it basically does

335
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,350
is computers try to understand process

336
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,259
and derive meaning from human language

337
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,230
and this is basically what the we the

338
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,539
web speech recognition is all about it

339
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,970
is an abstraction that takes all that

340
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,279
complexity away for us in order to

341
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,139
include speech recognition into our

342
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,690
application there is though an

343
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,970
underlying problem and human language is

344
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,109
ambiguous a word can have many meanings

345
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:40,779
and this is what makes natural language

346
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:43,779
processing so hard to get right

347
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:46,929
now I'm telling you from experience the

348
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:49,720
German Alexa and me we have the worst

349
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,720
relationship ever like I talked to her

350
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,690
she understands pretty much anything

351
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,200
even though I think I can talk German

352
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,450
English is better but I realized my

353
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,989
mother tongue is Spanish is the best and

354
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:07,320
if we're talking about accessibility

355
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,970
it's not going to be useful for us if

356
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,389
the application don't understand our

357
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:16,330
intentions and for this demo application

358
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,269
I thought

359
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,210
Alexis intent would be a really good

360
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,359
source of inspiration for tackling to

361
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,090
some extent the problem of ambiguous

362
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,409
language meaning you saw on the app we

363
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:35,019
can go through the playlist so there are

364
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,029
many ways that I can express my

365
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:39,789
intention I could say show the playlist

366
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:42,460
go to playlist we can even go further

367
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,580
and consider what if the service these

368
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,470
are actual responses I got from the

369
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,279
service before it says ok lists so

370
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,350
instead of frustrating the user I can

371
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,350
already consider these cases and trigger

372
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,350
the relator command to it

373
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,470
so this is a very basic example of how

374
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,020
something like that looks it's not even

375
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,970
that clean because I'm mixing languages

376
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,490
like you can do it way better but it

377
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,070
works so basically all the intentions

378
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,010
for me to navigate to the playlist it

379
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,360
will trigger one action we will iterate

380
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,630
over this in ten samples and we will

381
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,750
register to a command Factory and what

382
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,020
this command factory does it

383
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,840
administrates it manage it matches the

384
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,980
commands with intents we go over it one

385
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,140
more time and we have this callable

386
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,960
intent that we will need later when we

387
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,480
receive the result and I have a little

388
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,220
demo for you and I heard from Raul

389
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,190
yesterday I love that he said let's hope

390
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,070
the demo gods make this possible and I

391
00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:03,360
hope that too so basically check that

392
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,530
I have this funny-looking microphone but

393
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:21,550
it will make it better and exploding so

394
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,550
it's working fine like I said Internet

395
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,430
is very slow I'm gonna with the hotspot

396
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,630
but we'll give it a try

397
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,950
so we would say something like show

398
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:44,130
playlist

399
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,160
go to playlist so we'll go to the

400
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,100
playlist is a very basic example then

401
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,070
you will see don't judge me for my pal a

402
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,630
list so this is basically all of my

403
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,050
Spotify playlists they have gone until

404
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,300
now and we can check this one riding the

405
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:13,760
Lightning go to riding the Lightning so

406
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,100
it goes actually way faster but I like I

407
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,040
said it's pretty slow and these are all

408
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,200
the tracks so I could say something like

409
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,160
let's try something hard like

410
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,930
peaseblossom boogie all right play

411
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:42,580
peaseblossom boogie

412
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:52,540
okay they better work

413
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,320
the API don't wants to give the right

414
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,790
response oh one more time

415
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:02,010
let me try something first is this

416
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,730
working

417
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,990
yeah this is working so I'll go back and

418
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:14,100
we try it one more time play

419
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:24,510
peaseblossom boogie so the response to

420
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,810
came and now we're playing this on so

421
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,720
it's pretty fun if you like vintage rock

422
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,180
music and and before we get done there's

423
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,590
one more thing I want to show you

424
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,160
because this is not just for English so

425
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,950
you have to correct me if I'm wrong I

426
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,020
think it is the bcp 47 tack right this

427
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,140
time that you can use so basically any

428
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,960
language supported by this tack can be

429
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,290
used as a recognition engine and I was

430
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,560
asking in Norway because I didn't knew

431
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,990
in Norway there's apparently like four

432
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,660
dialects or of Norwegian well they all

433
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,690
of them work and I would like to show

434
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,740
you how can we do something like

435
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:24,119
languages

436
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:28,610
and we will try it in Spanish and now

437
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,889
you have to excuse me that's not really

438
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:35,509
empathetic for me but I was taught

439
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,730
Spanish for a second not just for the

440
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,120
example and we will do something like

441
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,820
you see the second one vibra tropical

442
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,120
and what I love about it is I don't even

443
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,580
have to create a new instance so it

444
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,009
denying weekly changes just by changing

445
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:57,799
the the right property and we can try

446
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:04,289
second one talk on the side of Yang

447
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:08,600
yeah that's wrong talking with salary

448
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,750
yang and that's wrong again one more

449
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,820
time

450
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:23,570
toka masala yang

451
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:38,880
Doka masala yang hallelujah so thank you

452
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,760
so we have three minutes I have to hurry

453
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,880
up right so I I had a fallback in case

454
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,510
it didn't work so we can skip that and

455
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,640
so we covered the basics and there are

456
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,560
some methods that are very useful I just

457
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,150
want to give you the whole overview of

458
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,980
what you need to get this thing running

459
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,880
we have three methods the start method

460
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,140
triggers the speech recognition engine

461
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,130
and this case was kind of weird because

462
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,350
I have to press the mic button there is

463
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,710
for sure a better way to trigger that

464
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,990
but that was our case the the start

465
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,840
method there are the stop and a board

466
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,330
method which basically tells the service

467
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,570
stop recognizing and give me or give me

468
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,260
not the process results until then we

469
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,260
have some events too we have on error

470
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,600
that could be very useful if we have a

471
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,790
good error strategy going on because

472
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,250
it's really granular the letters know

473
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,450
what the service didn't work and pretty

474
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,640
much this is the result we will get it

475
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,670
is the speech recognition result which

476
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,460
is within the second area which is the

477
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,070
speech recognition alternative and it

478
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,530
will give us the list of words and a

479
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,400
confidence score we filter those events

480
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,340
and keep them to the command factory

481
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,710
that we saw already and it will match

482
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,730
those commands with the results and

483
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:13,380
before we wrap it up I hope you have had

484
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,980
an idea of how all the things you can do

485
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,020
this is just a very little example but

486
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,060
but I hope that you understand there are

487
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,030
so many Web API s and we can use them in

488
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,580
creative ways to actually give more

489
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,130
possibilities people to interact with

490
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,500
our applications now you might be

491
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,060
wondering browser support it looks

492
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,330
horrible

493
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,779
as you see it is still an experimental

494
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:43,149
API I was surprised that it is coming in

495
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:46,889
edge but there are a lot of third-party

496
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:49,299
JavaScript API s that you can use

497
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:51,940
instead for a production project there

498
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,129
is natural language processing from

499
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:57,100
Watson there is speech to text so

500
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,619
there's a bunch of libraries or engines

501
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:02,289
that you can use for that so it

502
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:05,100
shouldn't stop you from trying it and

503
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,980
this small project is on get up you can

504
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,809
try it out you can play with it you can

505
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:13,239
break it you're more than welcome to do

506
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,429
that and if you have any questions I

507
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:16,960
will be hanging out the next two days

508
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,690
and you can ask anything you would like

509
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,260
and that being said thank you very much
