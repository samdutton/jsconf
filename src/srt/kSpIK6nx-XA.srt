thanks to you too my name is Mauricio

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,000
Palma and I was born and raised in Costa

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,760
Rica and living in the beautiful city of

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,680
Hamburg for the past 11 years

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm also UI developer a syn Estrada

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,989
working with a colorful range of clients

18
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,989
mostly the big brands out there and I

19
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,879
must admit we're doing a lot of exciting

20
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,860
projects nowadays I'm also co-founder of

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,140
would like ocean that would like ocean

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,360
with craft swimmer out of ocean

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,570
recovered fishing nets and together with

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,000
several organizations and divers were

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,220
collecting ghost fishing nets to use

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,360
them in our products so to be quite

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,780
honest with you I think I'm one of those

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,080
polo kids of the web even though I'm 36

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,140
years old and what I mean with that is I

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,470
start developing sides I started for six

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,040
years

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,220
my first sites and apps for the web so I

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,340
was not around in 1991 when Tim

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,270
berners-lee announced HTML at the time

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,460
there was no method for styling web

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,420
pages neither was I around in 1996 when

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,600
Haakon V Lee first introduced the first

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,890
official specification of CSS level 1

39
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,329
which is the same year in which

40
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,580
Macromedia introduced flash

41
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,020
so it was pretty much at the same time

42
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,020
when Brendan eyes developed JavaScript

43
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,290
in just 10 days going through a lot of

44
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,080
corporate and marketing reinventions

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,810
like mocha and life spray so not I was

46
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,340
not around during this exciting and

47
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,440
turbulent times of the wild wild web I

48
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,319
could enjoy working with html5 css3 es5

49
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,280
harmony and all the amazing api's that

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,600
the browser provide for us today so life

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,420
has been good to me at least I thought

52
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,610
so when I started out and as a journal

53
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,519
after gathering some years of experience

54
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,540
I realized I was not quite right I spent

55
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,610
countless hours trying to find

56
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,250
performing techniques to manipulate the

57
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,310
quickness of the Dom researching all

58
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,650
kind of techniques to generate smooth

59
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,670
animations trying desperately to get CSS

60
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,220
to work smoothly with JavaScript

61
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,680
second

62
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,480
so time goes by and you gather some

63
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,730
experience within your possibilities and

64
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,130
try to work yourself around all these

65
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,280
things and don't get me wrong I love

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
doing what I do and it's the same laughs

67
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,050
I have since day one and just like you

68
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,370
just heard speaking is something

69
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,300
relatively new to me and as you probably

70
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,570
noticed my first stalk ever I think I

71
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,150
have three stalks in my life and this is

72
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,720
a real special one it is my first one

73
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,050
and it all started with my friend Gregor

74
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,750
Adams also known with the handle picks

75
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,300
alas who actually invited me to co-host

76
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,900
a CSS variables talk at an internal

77
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,220
singer strata technical off-site and

78
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,860
this is how I started experimenting

79
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,080
playing around and actually using CSS

80
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,830
variables and I must say it changed the

81
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,450
way I write my CSS today so it's been a

82
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,690
busy exciting journey and I would like

83
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,960
in a very humble way to inspire you from

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,780
what I have learned in this journey

85
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,520
hopefully at the end of this talk you

86
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,500
will take back one or two techniques

87
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,380
that you could use at your own work that

88
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,650
would be the best so it is we should be

89
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,120
looking some little stars in the

90
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,919
background but anyways we're getting

91
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,669
into that it is this desire to find

92
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,760
hidden information that will allow us to

93
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,850
change the way we work today the way we

94
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,419
write our CSS today to be always hungry

95
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,710
for more information so in the screen

96
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,430
there is a hidden message oh and let's

97
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,810
find out what it is

98
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,540
so we're using the spotlight

99
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,540
a new hope and that's the name of this

100
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,550
talk that I prepared for you and

101
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,060
hopefully I can demonstrate how elegant

102
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:49,869
and powerful CSS variables can be

103
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,080
so I'm using SVG's for this example so

104
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,789
let's go through the example see how we

105
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,309
made that and decided to create the

106
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:01,069
animation like I said with an SVG and

107
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:07,009
CSS variables the new hope' headline is

108
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:11,389
an SVG path and to achieve this

109
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:13,819
spotlight effect I'm using four

110
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:16,669
different SVG circles using custom

111
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,770
properties to define their positioning

112
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,209
within the SVG view box as you can see

113
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:25,519
property names are prefixed with a - -

114
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,219
annotation and it contains a value that

115
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:31,490
can be reused these are the custom

116
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,699
properties if we take a look at the

117
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:36,769
values we see we have the radius pretty

118
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,860
much the size of the circle we have a CX

119
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,469
custom property which is the positioning

120
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:48,749
in the x-axis and the same goes for C Y

121
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,069
by using the VAR function we can access

122
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:55,550
the values we previously assign at root

123
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,129
level this would be the positioning of

124
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,249
all circles using the conceal spot class

125
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:04,309
and all of them are currently positioned

126
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:10,009
in the middle so we can only see one

127
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,259
circle so we're selling all four circles

128
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:16,550
they're stacked behind each other but if

129
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,279
we reflect for a moment and think about

130
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,099
the custom property spec you'll find

131
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:24,490
something like custom properties are

132
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,009
ordinary CSS properties and what that

133
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,559
means is that they are resolved with the

134
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,659
same inheritance and cascade rules so if

135
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:40,009
we take this information toward oh one

136
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:45,280
second

137
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,170
okay by using this information to our

138
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,890
advantage

139
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,100
we can make all circles visible given

140
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,030
them a new position and but instead of

141
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,360
overriding the rule declaration we can

142
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,210
reassign the custom property with a new

143
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,120
value in an element with the higher

144
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,300
specificity that's a hard work but it

145
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,760
kind of work out right now so in that

146
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:18,080
case yep in this case we can use the

147
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,980
none type pseudo class element to

148
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,950
recursively reassign the new value

149
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:30,050
leading us into this result so there is

150
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,360
one last thing we knew in our CSS to

151
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,720
achieve the spotlight effect so we will

152
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,870
be using the clip path property

153
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,479
referring to the for SVG click path

154
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,090
elements what these four elements

155
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,800
contain are the extractives

156
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,380
letter sections of the new hope headline

157
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,260
this will be the clip regions of each

158
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,810
circle leading us to this effect and now

159
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,690
it's time for magic but not the kind of

160
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,880
magic when you know why code is behaving

161
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,360
in a certain way not that so in my

162
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,060
opinion this is one of the most powerful

163
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,500
features of CSS variables custom

164
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,400
properties are available at runtime

165
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,370
making them accessible at all times in

166
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,940
JavaScript to JavaScript and every time

167
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,210
I say that I get so excited think about

168
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:40,309
it for a minute

169
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:44,829
did you reflect that on that I hope so

170
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:48,129
it is very important in order to

171
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,680
simplify the explanation of what is

172
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,259
going on in JavaScript I will focus only

173
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,079
in the custom properties if you want to

174
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:58,269
take a look at what different techniques

175
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,029
I'm using in JavaScript you can take a

176
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:03,490
look at the code things that there will

177
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,670
be available and I also prepared a

178
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,730
little a code pen collection for this

179
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,879
conference and you can see what's going

180
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,899
on under the hood so for now we'll be

181
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,110
listening to the mousemove event read

182
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,259
and calculate values in relation to the

183
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:26,879
SVG view box and the real fun is

184
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,399
happening on that update function by

185
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,519
just using the set property method we're

186
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,790
able to write and update the custom

187
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,160
property values at the root of the

188
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,629
document so we can take a look at the

189
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:51,980
effect one more time

190
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,440
and this is how we achieve that effect

191
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,690
thanks to custom properties we can do

192
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:11,650
that

193
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,020
yes so I close my eyes to all ends and

194
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:22,930
open my heart to new beginnings

195
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,780
oops

196
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:37,180
Oh No

197
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,570
so I don't think I get tired of

198
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,790
repeating these but custom properties

199
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,430
being available at run time opened a

200
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,730
whole new world of possibilities and in

201
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,220
my pursuit to illustrate this for you I

202
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,709
prepared this galaxy animation using

203
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:59,190
HTML CSS in just a bit of JavaScript for

204
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:05,130
no it's not after a while you cannot

205
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:10,840
hear the sound it gets really annoying

206
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,350
so what I want to do is create an

207
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,529
animation for every single star

208
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:18,990
something like a circular sensation from

209
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,770
the X and C axis so if we take a look at

210
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,490
that this is what we want to do with

211
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,060
this single star and for this I'm

212
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,930
actually running a timeline from 0 to 1

213
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,630
and this is my actual counter and if you

214
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,850
can look at the button by including this

215
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,420
in mine sine and cosine custom

216
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,850
properties I can achieve this wished

217
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,160
circular transition and it's a little

218
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,620
bit Yankee and I've been having problems

219
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,800
with my speaker notes at slides if

220
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,260
somebody knows the reason of it can tell

221
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,870
me about later it's been a pain so you

222
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,180
have to trust me it's actually more

223
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,700
smooth but anyways I emphasize in the

224
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,459
word transition because such animations

225
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,130
we want to focus on hitting the 60

226
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,380
frames per second mark and we don't want

227
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,200
to retrieve a repaint at first of all

228
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,300
the reason for this is that today's

229
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,570
devices refresh their screens 60 times

230
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,110
per second that means that if there's a

231
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,899
transition running the browser needs to

232
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,740
match the device refresh rate refresh

233
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,420
rate and that's what you should always

234
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,930
achieve to

235
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,550
but hearing 60 frames-per-second marked

236
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,990
with one element it is not that hard now

237
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,300
in order to dip it to demonstrate the

238
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,060
differences I did two examples and the

239
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,000
first one would be without CSS variables

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I think the way you should you would

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,940
normally do it and it looks like

242
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,140
something like this we spread the stars

243
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,690
are the elements across the x axis and

244
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,190
the z axis with sorry the x axis and the

245
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,160
y axis with position:absolute we're

246
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,970
achieving depth by using the translate C

247
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,630
and because we want to animate the Stars

248
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,190
using transform I have to iterate over

249
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,620
250 elements retrieve their CSS

250
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,710
translate Z value and save it in an

251
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,050
array that is reference with the name

252
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,780
z-axis list so I have to iterate one

253
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,260
more time map the values of the

254
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,490
translate C or our array and write the

255
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,760
new translation all of it in the endless

256
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,600
60 times requestanimationframe loop and

257
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,290
it already sounds so expensive so if we

258
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:08,600
take a look

259
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,180
and

260
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,180
we check out the frames per second

261
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,180
can you see it no so I will have to read

262
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,650
it for you I cannot even see it myself

263
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:29,800
but something 24:22 and you see it is

264
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,190
Genki so it's a lot of operations for

265
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:40,380
the browser to do so let's close this

266
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:46,020
and continue

267
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,280
now I want to create the same animation

268
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,910
using CSS variables and with CSS

269
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,810
variables it is much more elegant and

270
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,510
intuitive I don't have to iterate over

271
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,240
the Dom I don't have to retrieve any

272
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,810
values from the Dom at the end I just

273
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,510
need to update and write the values from

274
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,780
my sine and cosine variables that's it

275
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:18,710
it's pretty pretty simple our CSS

276
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,560
remains in our CSS and not as inline

277
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,010
Styles inline Styles in our Dom and this

278
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,200
is one of the reasons I love custom

279
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,950
properties or CSS variables so much but

280
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,740
like in any journey I encounter some

281
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,720
difficulties and I will not lie to you

282
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,160
it was not all sunshine and rainbows

283
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,110
with the CSS variables inclement ation

284
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,330
at first I was not hitting the 60 frames

285
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,850
per second mark and I started freaking

286
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,280
out like I'm here talking to you about

287
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,220
fuses variables and performance and Adam

288
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,650
even achieving or reaching my own

289
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,670
expectations

290
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,070
so as it turns out pseudo elements with

291
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,620
filter C use this filter like blur and

292
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,520
brightness are super expensive to

293
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,850
animate so I had to change my styling

294
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,970
strategy now the stars are not looking

295
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,540
so good as originally but like in life

296
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,840
you have to make sometimes compromises

297
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:36,730
so let's take a look at the example

298
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,419
since a little jacket I will close my

299
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,120
speaker notes because I want you to

300
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,880
experience to be of animation so give me

301
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,290
one second I don't know if it's going to

302
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,310
be good in you

303
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,390
[Music]

304
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:59,480
and it's not bad

305
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,540
we'll check the frames per second

306
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:13,290
and we are 758 almost there you should

307
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,840
always try to keep the 60

308
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,690
frames-per-second heart now we will

309
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:40,950
close this

310
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:49,260
and we continue

311
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,660
so I started wondering what if we try

312
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,150
the new stars tragedy with the first

313
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,420
demo without ceases variables and not so

314
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,630
surprisingly I was able to actually hit

315
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,910
the 60 frames per second mark

316
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,030
so I actually realized the browser is

317
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,610
actually so powerful that you can

318
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,410
animate all these divs all these

319
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,950
elements in the DOM and still can reach

320
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,360
a 60 frames per second animation so

321
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:33,480
let's take a look at that

322
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,590
and we are 58 59

323
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:44,380
almost at 58 almost there but always

324
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:52,510
looking for 60 very important now this

325
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,789
is what I love the most about CSS

326
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:57,730
variables beyond anything else that's

327
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,950
what I think is the most powerful

328
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,529
feature and is their ability and

329
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:05,260
elegance to interact with web devices

330
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,340
api's in a declarative manner UI

331
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,820
development is changing and develop it's

332
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,669
changing at a rapid pace so when we

333
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:18,130
speak about responsive we're speaking

334
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,179
more about an interface interacting to

335
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,690
the user user context more than just the

336
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,240
layout composition adapting to a

337
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,580
viewport width that's what actually

338
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,260
responsive should be meaning today so if

339
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,630
we take this animated galaxy interface

340
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,500
how could we contextualize our current

341
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,100
showcase and maybe we could move the

342
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,010
perspective of the galaxy according to

343
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,679
our device orientation and then give us

344
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,460
this look that we're on a spaceship it

345
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,890
sounded like a good example for me so

346
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,700
let's give it a try so with the

347
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,679
assistance of a little WebSocket server

348
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,830
and client I will be able to give you

349
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,649
the same mobile experience on the screen

350
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:12,570
and maybe with a little bit of latency

351
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,450
we will have to see so for now we will

352
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,779
listen to the device orientation event

353
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,549
for us there are only two values that

354
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:24,760
are relevant at the moment and device

355
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,559
orientation actually returns four

356
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,690
different values but we will focus on

357
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,640
two for now the alpha alpha is pretty

358
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,730
much the movement of the device in the C

359
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,120
axis it is tempered the perpendicular to

360
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,909
the ground and you can imagine it like

361
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:45,519
line that goes to the middle of the

362
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,499
earth it returns the value around 300

363
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:54,489
around zero and 360 degrees beta on the

364
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:57,460
other way returns to degree value from

365
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:05,849
minus 180 to 180 degrees and for our CSS

366
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:09,700
this is all what we will need for it to

367
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,779
work so let's give it a try need a

368
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:18,580
second to actually start my server

369
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:28,150

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:35,030
this is not for real I just

371
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,370
[Applause]

372
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,960
when a second I hope I can show you this

373
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,980
not this would be really sad one second

374
00:22:47,980 --> 00:23:13,430
please

375
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,760
so one second if it doesn't work we just

376
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,160
leave it for now I'll try it one more

377
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:37,110
time

378
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:45,370
okay that's great so we're ready to go

379
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,890
so we have the server running now we'll

380
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,870
connect to the server with my own mobile

381
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:57,920
device

382
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,940
unfortunately you cannot see it really

383
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,800
good but like I said all the examples

384
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,480
are important and so if you want to take

385
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,780
a look at it now I'm moving my device

386
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:29,000
and it's having happen

387
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:35,190
so now I'm actually moving the device

388
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,030
little Latin see but as you can see one

389
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,100
can use in the declarant declarative

390
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:49,250
manner use our CSS to actually interact

391
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,880
with it

392
00:24:50,880 --> 00:25:00,450
[Music]

393
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,400
I closed that before we all go crazy

394
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:10,810
with the music and let's continue so

395
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:14,890
this this stop is reaching to an end but

396
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,590
I have one last showcase I hope it works

397
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,220
because we did like in the last minute

398
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,280
for you or maybe for me so I'm not sure

399
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,690
about it so I think lightly with

400
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,460
contextualizing interfaces and I thought

401
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,150
what if we contextualize the result of

402
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,500
this presentation so I prepared an emoji

403
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,250
happy meter and it's using the Audio API

404
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,270
I'm using CSS variables and SVG's and

405
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,140
this is how it works so the result

406
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,630
completely depends on you so if you like

407
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:00,070
let's take a look if you like what you

408
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,050
just heard you have to give it up and

409
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,590
you have to give it up real loud so come

410
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,410
let's try it

411
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:22,830
[Applause]

412
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,450
okay I'll make this smile that's right

413
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:34,920
again one more time

414
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:46,310
so thanks thank you very much I would

415
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,990
say that went really well for your first
