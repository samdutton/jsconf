screaming's marklar

2
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,100
i'm marklar I'm a marklar at marklar

3
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,140
here to talk to you about how you can

4
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,469
make your mark larmor marklar at this

5
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,999
point you're probably saying to yourself

6
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,370
what the marklar is she talking about

7
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,129
well this has been an exercise in

8
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,069
semantics because if we use the same

9
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:02,940
word for everything it has no meaning it

10
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,500
would be the same word over and over

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
again which would be useless

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,640
so especially to people who can't see

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,560
visual designs it's really important

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,729
that we add meaning to our words here's

15
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,890
a code example let me zoom in a little

16
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,799
bit and actually given what we're going

17
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,270
to talk about today this isn't that

18
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,780
far-fetched I have a marklar tag it has

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,049
a nested marklar tag some text it has a

20
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,289
bark lar that looks like a link but it

21
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,750
kind of doesn't really tell you what

22
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,079
it's for if we created our web

23
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,960
components without semantics we run the

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,689
risk of adding a lot of Solus div tags

25
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,660
around the web and nobody needs that

26
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,100
so you're here to hear about the

27
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,409
accessibility of web components Who am I

28
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,200
I am Marcy Sutton I am a developer at

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,869
substantial in Seattle which is a 60 ish

30
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,590
person development studio and what we do

31
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,499
design and development but I work there

32
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,810
because they allow me to expand my skill

33
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,019
set beyond just the front end but I am

34
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,239
stronger at the front end so along with

35
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,430
the projects I work on I really focus on

36
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,319
making them accessible and recently

37
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,629
that's included a fitness app for

38
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,730
personal trainers and a whisky

39
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,040
recommendations app because everybody

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,709
wants to drink whiskey right so why

41
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:27,760
shouldn't we make all of those things

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,629
accessible

43
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,469
I love accessibility because it adds

44
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,639
meaning to my work

45
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,889
it makes the everyday grind a lot more

46
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,530
enjoyable it's the right thing to do and

47
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,349
also accessibility can provide some

48
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:42,730
really freaking cool

49
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,739
development opportunities it is not

50
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:47,560
boring as I tried to convince Dominic

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,269
but he's not sold quite yet so some

52
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,040
accessibility challenges that are worth

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,560
running going over real quick to refresh

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,530
our memory antics is a huge thing in

55
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,419
accessibility that I'm going to talk a

56
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,430
lot about today in the context of web

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,519
components so the type of element that

58
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,849
we create it becomes an object and that

59
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:11,709
type of object matters to somebody who

60
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,079
can't see it

61
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,180
so keyboard access this is actually a

62
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,400
wider audience than just people using

63
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,959
screen readers this affects a lot of

64
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,180
people how many of you have ever broken

65
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,409
your arm how many of you have run out of

66
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:29,889
batteries in your mouse yeah that's a

67
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,989
lot of you right so you want to use your

68
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:35,199
keyboard but we are grown too accustomed

69
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,379
to it really sucking out their keyboard

70
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,659
excess is a huge problem and we're used

71
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,579
to being able to give up and use the

72
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,470
mouse but if you couldn't use a mouse

73
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,540
because you had poor motor control or

74
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,579
you're using some sort of assistive

75
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,540
technology you rely on that cue so it's

76
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,729
really important that we build that into

77
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:57,099
all of our websites but I'm going to

78
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,720
focus a lot on web components because

79
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,780
it's more fun to talk about also in

80
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,699
accessibility challenges text

81
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,189
alternatives are really important so

82
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:08,680
that includes the alt attributes on your

83
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,739
images form labels or their Aria

84
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,799
equivalents and off screen text which I

85
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,009
use a lot to add text to my documents

86
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,930
when it's not represented in a visual

87
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,560
design I can put headings or other text

88
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,380
off screen to give users who are non

89
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,290
visual use

90
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,720
some context of a document and that

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,990
actually rounds out the whole HTML

92
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,270
hierarchy in my document but I don't

93
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,250
leave it out because it wasn't in a

94
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,680
visual design saying it wasn't in the

95
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,630
design is not a good enough excuse we

96
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,110
need text alternatives and another part

97
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,670
of accessibility challenges is color

98
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,920
contrast and this starts with your brand

99
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,270
guide so you want to work with a

100
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,340
designer to make sure that the colors in

101
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,940
your brand and on your webpages meet the

102
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,220
color contrast ratio so that people can

103
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,650
see your content web components you're

104
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,880
probably hearing a lot about them these

105
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,980
days and for good reason because it's

106
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,110
sort of a revolution for us as front-end

107
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,600
developers there's five major parts to

108
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,580
web components which are standards

109
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,770
moving through the w3c and into modern

110
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,530
browsers right now custom elements which

111
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,040
we'll talk about today shadow Dom

112
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,500
templates HTML imports which are super

113
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,760
cool because you can include a

114
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,340
significant of HTML just like a

115
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,140
stylesheet and a link tag and then

116
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,390
decorators which actually don't have a

117
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,400
spec yet as far as I know but the idea

118
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,920
with decorators is that you could

119
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,060
include the fit of HTML in your CSS just

120
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,770
like you would include a background

121
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,200
image except you're including UML and

122
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,290
that will then decorate your HTML for

123
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,290
presentation purposes so that's really

124
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,300
exciting I'm curious to see where

125
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,170
decorators go today we're going to talk

126
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,270
about web components we're gonna focus

127
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,850
on shadow DOM and what happens in a

128
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,530
screen reader because that's what I was

129
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,780
really curious about and then we'll talk

130
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,480
about custom elements and how we need to

131
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,680
add some antics to those elements why

132
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,720
are we excited I mean you may be you

133
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,760
have your own reasons but I'm excited

134
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,380
about web components because it's a

135
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,440
chance to extend the Dom and we have a

136
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,180
lot of power with that that's exciting

137
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,250
we aren't waiting for browser

138
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,130
implementers to give us new elements

139
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,160
like the html5 form inputs there's some

140
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,410
really cool stuff there but it takes a

141
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,120
long time for those standards to roll

142
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,050
out and they vary across browsers so we

143
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,400
have been granted this

144
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,250
or to create new elements but we need to

145
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,410
make sure they're accessible so I'll

146
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,570
tell you about how we can make our

147
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,460
elements accessible and what we get for

148
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,729
free and then lastly we can minimize

149
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:55,820
conflicts by encapsulating part of our

150
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,350
HTML and that's where shadow Dom comes

151
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,770
in

152
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,759
so shadow DOM is spooky sounding but the

153
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,280
idea is that you're encapsulating a dom

154
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,400
subtree under a shadow root and there's

155
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,840
some terms that we should talk about

156
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,070
here shadow host is the element that

157
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,080
you're actually inserting your shadow

158
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,900
Dom into if you think about the html5

159
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,960
video tag and how you only have to drop

160
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,300
in a video tag but along with that comes

161
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,310
all of the controls the little volume

162
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,139
slider there's a playback slider you

163
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,639
don't have to actually implement each of

164
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,919
those pieces you get those as part of

165
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,190
this component so the shadow host is the

166
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,849
video tag that's in your regular Dom a

167
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,130
shadow tree is the node tree that gets

168
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,139
inserted into that shadow Dom so all of

169
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,120
those parts in the video tag our shadow

170
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,349
tree and then the shadow root is the

171
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,300
root node of the shadow tree and that's

172
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,889
actually behind an encapsulation

173
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:04,699
boundary so trees and I learned a lot

174
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:06,349
more about trees as I did some of this

175
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:10,070
research they exist in other parts of

176
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,880
computer science

177
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,639
they resemble nature there's some

178
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,620
characteristics of trees that I find

179
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,930
really interesting there's a root value

180
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,720
there are sub trees with children and

181
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,770
it's a represent representation of a set

182
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,180
of linked nodes you can see that the end

183
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,979
of the tree branches don't circle back

184
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,289
and reach each other so it's just

185
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,200
interesting to compare trees in other

186
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,240
languages with the Dom we don't really

187
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,140
think of it as a linked list or a Dom or

188
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,760
a tree data structure but it is so

189
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,950
taking that concept and actually looking

190
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,870
at the shadow Dom I have an image here

191
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,870
from the w3c shadow DOM

192
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,420
back and we can see the regular Dom on

193
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,790
the left and it has our shadow hosts in

194
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,070
the document tree and then on the right

195
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,200
we have a representation of a shadow dom

196
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,779
subtree and the line in between is

197
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,160
illustrating that there's actually a

198
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,950
boundary and this boundary I was really

199
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,600
curious what would happen in a screen

200
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,660
reader because you have scripts and

201
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,000
styles that don't cost that boundary but

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,339
what happens to a screen reader or any

203
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:20,080
other kind of assistive technology like

204
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,110
a screen magnifier and as it turns out

205
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,900
actually the screen reader can get past

206
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,670
that boundary but I wanted to know why

207
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,310
it was surprisingly easy once I went and

208
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,589
tested it it just worked but I really

209
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:34,570
wanted to learn why so I dug in more and

210
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,510
found out some interesting stuff I

211
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,779
actually went and looked a lot at how

212
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,520
browsers work and if you're curious

213
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,680
about this there's a really good article

214
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,410
from html5rocks called how browsers work

215
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,980
and on the screen right now I have a

216
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,600
screenshot of the WebKit rendering

217
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,660
engine flow it's pretty simplified

218
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,940
because browsers are actually some of

219
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,730
the most complex pieces of software they

220
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,860
clean up our messes they fix our broken

221
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,650
code they render it anyway

222
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,990
it's actually really interesting we give

223
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,600
ie a lot of trouble but they clean up a

224
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,370
lot of really bad HTML and render it

225
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,010
anyway we kind of forget that because

226
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,550
chrome is really forgiving but what is

227
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,350
really interesting to look at here with

228
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,600
this rendering flow is that you start

229
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,900
off with your HTML and you can see from

230
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,630
this diagram it parses your HTML it

231
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,390
token eise's it it creates objects out

232
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,370
of your tags and those objects have

233
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,410
types those types are really important

234
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,080
like in the case of a form when a screen

235
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,950
reader encounter it changes modes and it

236
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,959
gives the user a different set of

237
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,120
options for interacting with it so if

238
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,250
you just had a bunch of Dom elements or

239
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,550
div elements and you wanted it to

240
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,730
actually act like a form that's why you

241
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,650
know we use input elements is because a

242
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,690
screen reader will be told what to do

243
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:05,030
with the element let's see what else so

244
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,490
another thing to mention is that the

245
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,160
objects in this rendering process are

246
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,790
affected by JavaScript and CSS so in the

247
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,760
rendering process we affect our Dom tree

248
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,920
with JavaScript we can append elements

249
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,290
we can hide them with CSS and that

250
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,960
affects the actual tree so elements that

251
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,880
are hidden with display:none and CSS

252
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,220
don't get rendered and therefore they

253
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,990
don't have accessibility objects so

254
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,370
they're kept out of a screen reader

255
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,280
that's how when you're say for example

256
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,350
you had a hover menu and you wanted to

257
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,840
keep all of the content when it's closed

258
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,670
from actually getting read in a screen

259
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,770
reader because if you can't see it with

260
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,750
your eyes you shouldn't force a screen

261
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,000
reader or a keyword through it so to

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,830
hide that from a screen reader we hit

263
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,110
just or we add display:none and the

264
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,850
effect that that has is that it doesn't

265
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,310
paint it and it doesn't add an object to

266
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,680
the accessibility tree so all of these

267
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,690
things the CSS and JavaScript they

268
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,390
affect this rendering process and what

269
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,650
you get in the end is a tree why is this

270
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,920
accessible for shadow Dom it's

271
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,770
accessible because it the screen reader

272
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,050
encounters the tree after rendering and

273
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,390
what they call it as rendered and I have

274
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,150
a funny you know pun here with Bob Roth

275
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,310
saying let's paint a happy little tree

276
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,440
because that's what a screen reader gets

277
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,930
it gets the tree as rendered and so

278
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,760
therefore the shadow Dom is actually

279
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,070
accessible which is a huge win super

280
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,020
exciting I didn't have to go beat up any

281
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,990
browser implementers because these specs

282
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,150
are developing and evolving and I

283
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,070
thought if there was a problem it we

284
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,890
could go do something about it now but I

285
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,510
didn't have to which is awesome I could

286
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,860
make friends instead of beating people

287
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,690
up so how do we shadow DOM it's pretty

288
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,480
easy I have a simple example here in

289
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,540
some JavaScript I'll step through each

290
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,180
piece of this we start with a template

291
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,370
tag which in the case of Internet

292
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,260
Explorer like older versions you

293
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,730
actually have to hide the template tag

294
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,290
so they don't know what to do with it so

295
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,290
they render it but the template tag is

296
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,150
supposed to be an element that doesn't

297
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,550
get rendered it basically provides you a

298
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,740
content sandbox that you can grab

299
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,810
content and then inject it into

300
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,470
shadow Dom so to start to create a web

301
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,490
component I need to create an element by

302
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,550
using object that create and then I have

303
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,399
an a generic HTML element here and I

304
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,110
grab its prototype store it in a

305
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,990
variable and when I register this new

306
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,809
element I'm using a taco surprise

307
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:41,720
element which don't ask me what that is

308
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,079
but when we register this element it has

309
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:47,720
a callback function that we call and in

310
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,720
this created callback we need to create

311
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,399
a shadow root which I mentioned earlier

312
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,259
or the shadow root is the root node of a

313
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:58,730
shadow tree which is behind that a

314
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,309
capsulation boundary so to establish the

315
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:03,079
encapsulation boundary we create a

316
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:06,290
shadow root and then we own a template

317
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,110
into the shadow root and then our

318
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,050
element that we've created has

319
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,339
encapsulation and it has content because

320
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,449
we're injecting it this implement

321
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:19,999
expects there to be a tag in your Dom

322
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:24,019
already named taco - surprise and the

323
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,910
deal with creating your own tags is that

324
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,709
they have to have a dash in the middle

325
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:30,290
and that's sort of a prefix the the

326
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,139
characters before the dash are a prefix

327
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,370
this may be the w3c is gonna make a taco

328
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,259
surprise element at some point I'm not

329
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:42,589
really sure so let's do a little demo

330
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,329
because this is where the really

331
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,059
interesting stuff happens I thought when

332
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:49,639
I was creating an encapsulated web

333
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,889
component like what kind of component

334
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,230
would I make so I thought about a

335
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,600
nuclear detonator something where you

336
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,120
have to actually change the state of it

337
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,189
and so we have this little nuclear

338
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:03,350
detonator it's like you have to flip the

339
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,670
cap of it and then you get the real

340
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,550
button so for this and I'm gonna turn on

341
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,279
voiceover which how many of you of you

342
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,759
are Mac users did you know that you all

343
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,189
have a screen reader in your computer

344
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:18,800
already yeah awesome how many of you

345
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,990
have iPhones

346
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,309
you also have screen reader in your

347
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:24,740
pocket you can test your own stuff any

348
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,600
time it's really cool if you're a

349
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,649
Windows user you can get jaws what

350
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:32,259
stands for job access with speech that's

351
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:35,170
the most widely used screen reader you

352
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,439
can get it a free copy a demo copy that

353
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,720
lasts for 40 minutes at a time so I

354
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,029
encourage you to go and test with the

355
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,179
stuff I use VirtualBox and Windows VM

356
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,399
just so that I can test it on my Mac all

357
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,649
the time and that stuff's all free but

358
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,499
I'm gonna turn on voiceover voiceover on

359
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:56,350
Chrome explosion demo shadow DOM

360
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,730

361
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,429
explosion demo shadow DOM accessibility

362
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:06,129

367
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,579
thing up to slide I don't have to use

368
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,490
the mouse so I can move it and it's

369
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,069
actually changing the position of little

370
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:33,699
sliders really group it's asking me if I

371
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:35,319
am I really sure do I really want to

372
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:36,999
detonate the thing and cause you are

373
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,829
currently on a button inside of HTML

374
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:41,439
content to click this button press

375
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:44,649
control option space I definitely really

376
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:49,470
want to see what happens developer tools

377
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:59,019
voiceover lot so I like goats I think

378
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,120
it's really cool and I do have

379
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,620
explosions on the screen right now but

380
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,720
there's also an animated gif of goats on

381
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,480
this bendy piece of metal and I yeah I

382
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,130
want to be them I think that looks

383
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,120
really funny and it's just a word if you

384
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,890
end up grabbing my slides which I'll

385
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,069
tweet in a little bit you might not want

386
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,929
to get this demo unless you're on a

387
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:21,279
really good web connection because that

388
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,130
gif is really big like don't look at it

389
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,919
on your phone because I yeah I want to

390
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,520
preserve your data plan so what we saw

391
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,380
there was that I could use the keyboard

392
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,850
and a screen reader to go right through

393
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,100
that shadow boundary and then I had

394
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,840
enabled the component with the keyboard

395
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,090
so that I could use it and that those

396
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,290
are some of the components

397
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,480
of accessibility that we need to think

398
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,340
about and it's regardless of whether

399
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,260
it's going through shadow Dom boundary

400
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,360
or into a custom element we need

401
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,440
semantics we need keyboard access and we

402
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,170
need text alternatives so on that

403
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,870
element I had Aria attributes that told

404
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,910
me what the maximum value and/or the

405
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,800
minimum and the maximum values were and

406
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,370
then as it slides I update so it's a

407
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,960
percentage I have zero and a hundred

408
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,460
percent and as I slide it with

409
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,890
JavaScript I can update the Aria value

410
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,290
now property and tell you exactly where

411
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,390
the fighter is and that gives a screen

412
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,820
reader really like a lot of data they

413
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,770
actually know what to do with it even if

414
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,750
they can't see it so those are the

415
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,190
things that we need to think about more

416
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,660
when we create HTML current native

417
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,460
support for shadow DOM it's it's not

418
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,830
really out there yet but right now you

419
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,340
can use shadow Dom in chrome in Opera

420
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,500
Firefox nightly I've heard I actually

421
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,760
had a little trouble getting that to

422
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,590
work so I want to play with that more

423
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,100
and then Chrome for Android and I always

424
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,110
check this stuff when can I use com

425
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,640
that's a really good place to go check

426
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,450
support for polyfills there's polymer

427
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,430
and x-tags and they both have a shim

428
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,500
that you can drop in and that'll round

429
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,140
up support to evergreen browsers and

430
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,550
that means browsers that will update

431
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,130
themselves so for polymer they can get

432
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,620
you back to I a 10x tag and get you to

433
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,510
ie 9 but I think that's because they

434
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,270
have a little bit less features in X tag

435
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,020
and I heard that X tag they are possibly

436
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,430
going to roll those features into brick

437
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,920
and do away with it so the stuff is

438
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,590
changing all the time but both polymer

439
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,900
and brick offer you web component

440
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,870
libraries I am just using the shim so

441
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,700
that I can build my own components but

442
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,500
then I can round out support to a few

443
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,450
more browsers than just that list of

444
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:38,080
three or four so custom elements I think

445
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,580
it would be really cool if we had a taco

446
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,740
button and again I have a dash in there

447
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,960
because the w3c might want to make a

448
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,470
taco button at some point the custom

449
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,540
element basically means that like the

450
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,610
video tag you

451
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,380
could create your own elements the sky's

452
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,360
the limit really but we want to keep in

453
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,980
mind those accessibility things and I

454
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,420
mentioned earlier so adding semantics to

455
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,280
a native element there's a couple

456
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,920
different ways the first way is that

457
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,770
instead of creating the generic HTML

458
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,840
element the prototype here we're

459
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,880
creating an HTML button element and

460
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,010
along with that my hope is that you

461
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,480
would get some of the methods and

462
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,190
default values that a button would get

463
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,010
like if you have a button element that

464
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,740
you just instantiate in your Dom it you

465
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,400
can tap onto it it'll fire event if it's

466
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,410
a submit button in a form it would

467
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,880
actually trigger the form so that's

468
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,860
behavior that you get if you were

469
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,360
actually creating an element that was

470
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,280
supposed to do stuff like that you need

471
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,530
to add those methods or properties

472
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,419
unless you're extending an existing

473
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,710
element so for creating a native element

474
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,950
here we grab the HTML button elements

475
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,780
prototype and then we register our

476
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,820
element and when we register it the

477
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,520
magic keyword here is the extends

478
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,470
property and we give it a string of

479
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,270
whichever type of element works we're

480
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,309
creating so I'm creating a button and

481
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:01,980
then I can append this thing to the page

482
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,590
I found that to get this behavior you

483
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,720
have to actually inject the element into

484
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,790
the Dom it doesn't seem to work if I

485
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,730
have an existing tag in my Dom already

486
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,049
and then I modify it with JavaScript

487
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:16,200
these you have to actually inject so

488
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,760
this is something I'm playing with more

489
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,100
as time goes by but theoretically this

490
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,870
is how you would do it purely from the

491
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,230
JavaScript side another approach to

492
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,750
adding semantics is to use native child

493
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,390
elements and polymer is a little guilty

494
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,950
of this or at least they were all of

495
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,590
their or some of their examples they

496
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,390
would have a web component and then

497
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,860
inside of it they would use a div for

498
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,410
heading and that's just silly you should

499
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,270
use a heading for a heading or use a

500
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,460
button or an anchor or whatever your

501
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,280
code is supposed to do use the native

502
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,870
element and then you get all of that

503
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,360
behavior for free and it really helps a

504
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,220
screen reader that's kind of the whole

505
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,240
idea here but here I'm using an h2 and a

506
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,309
button and then I have maybe a nested

507
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,530
web component for some output maybe I'm

508
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,659
going to load an image

509
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:05,119
if that doesn't work I can show a little

510
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,729
error message here I say give me tacos

511
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:10,340
or give me death if I had an error I

512
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,720
could make a funny funny error message

513
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,849
so another way to add semantics is to

514
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:18,799
use Aria and if you're not familiar with

515
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,379
Aria it the goal of it and it stands for

516
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:23,210
accessible rich Internet applications

517
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,549
the goal of Aria is actually to fill in

518
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,759
gaps where HTML doesn't yet it doesn't

519
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,190
have behavior for what you need so you

520
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,129
can add a role to your HTML to make it

521
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:37,549
behave like a button element or a tab

522
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:39,619
panel or something but you need all of

523
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,690
the components and I encourage you to go

524
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,519
and read for any of those roles that

525
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,289
you're gonna use go read the information

526
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:47,330
the spec about it because you might

527
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,039
learn that that it might be a little

528
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,299
harder to implement than you thought

529
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,279
because there's expectations for the

530
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:54,440
keyboard and that sort of thing but for

531
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,659
a button it's pretty simple if you could

532
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,070
just use a regular button that would be

533
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,559
ideal but to get my taco button to work

534
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,989
I gave it a roll of button and then I

535
00:23:02,989 --> 00:23:04,460
gave it a tab index so that I could

536
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,499
actually tab onto it because the role of

537
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:09,499
button doesn't really give it it doesn't

538
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:11,239
give it tabindex to put it in the tab

539
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,429
order so to actually make it keyboard

540
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:16,450
accessible I need tabindex as well and

541
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,249
another example I have here is a slider

542
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:21,470
and I can add a role of slider and I was

543
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,139
thinking mmm slider I kind of want a

544
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:26,629
pork slider so I made a pork slider web

545
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,970
component and I gave it some Aria values

546
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,999
I need at least one pork slider so I

547
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:34,549
have an aria volume in of one I can only

548
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:37,249
eat maybe five I'll be pushing it a

549
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,080
little bit so I have a Bart Aria volume

550
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,349
acts of five but right now I have zero

551
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:44,149
pork sliders so I have a value now of

552
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:47,869
zero but as I get pork sliders I could

553
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:50,149
update that value that would be cool so

554
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:52,909
this is totally contrived example but I

555
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:54,950
mean slider that's what you're going to

556
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:01,999
think of from now on so which leads me

557
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:06,200
to the ultimate web component what if I

558
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,599
could have tacos

559
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:12,109
brought to me from the web Dogen amazing

560
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:14,130
right give me tacos

561
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,640
so I have this button it's similar to my

562
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,590
talked about and I had earlier it has

563
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,470
tabindex I can turn on voiceover

564
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,110
voiceover on chrome accessibility of web

565
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,490
components window

566
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,100
give me tacos the ultimate web conp oh

567
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,870
and ent ready for tacos so if i refresh

568
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,760
because I loaded all my slides earlier

569
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,650
so I have a ready event that I want to

570
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,390
currently only allowed three side of

571
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,330
reload this page accessibility 90%

572
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,360
loaded it was not playing all the time

573
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,059
voiceover is a little picky so the you

574
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,130
are Russo broth before I actually go

575
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,120
through with this I want to explain a

576
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,789
concept of aria-live regions and they're

577
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:55,620
really cool so basically the idea is

578
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,630
that you have a div off screen somewhere

579
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,590
on your page and it has to be in the

580
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,480
accessibility tree so you can't use

581
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,490
display:none but if you just position it

582
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,220
like way off the screen it'll still get

583
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,799
rendered theoretically but you just

584
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,750
can't see it visually so that's how you

585
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,210
expose content to a screen reader but

586
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,520
you keep it out of the visual design so

587
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,710
I have this div up screen and I give it

588
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,450
an aria live attribute and the property

589
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,830
that I give it in this case I'm using

590
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,289
polite but there's also assertive and so

591
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:30,240
the idea of this thing is that it's a

592
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,520
div that's like a message center and you

593
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,799
can append content into it and since

594
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,990
it's watching for it basically using

595
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,720
Aria live anytime I inject content into

596
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,549
this div it'll read it through a screen

597
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:43,530
reader and they're pretty well supported

598
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,190
so I have Aria live of polite here

599
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,799
because it's I don't need to be rude but

600
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,169
if I had an alert like you were logging

601
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:54,480
out or like some emergency you could use

602
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,120
assertive so I'm gonna interact with

603
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,460
this component and then it should give

604
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,250
us some feedback through voiceover

605
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,500
voiceover on chrome accessibility of web

606
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,960
components and what link skip to

607
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,370

608
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,240
