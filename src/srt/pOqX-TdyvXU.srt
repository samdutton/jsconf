3
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,080

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,960
developer in London and it's my first

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
time in Singapore it's a real pleasure

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,300
to be here thank you thank you for guys

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,420
from my team on the screen is a photo of

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,430
me exploring the day before this

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,860
conference in Singapore and my son fact

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,450
is that I absolutely love the weather

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,010
here everyone here seems to think I'm

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,760
weird for that but it's awesome even the

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,590
rain I love that you have warm brain

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,750
here I don't understand it but it's

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,270
awesome yes so in London I work on the

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,629
BBC News webpages so they are for

17
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,809
curated content to help people discover

18
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,090
content so what that means in practice

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,100
is that I work on pages like this so

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,170
this is the screenshot from today of the

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,600
BBC News website so on the front page in

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,189
addition to these we do like all sorts

23
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,380
of other kind of creations and things of

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,360
like collections of articles and content

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,490
like that so that's about me what are we

26
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,850
going to talk about today so the talk is

27
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,850
called accessibility in you first I will

28
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,290
talk about myself because that's kind of

29
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,020
fun I will talk about a little bit about

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,100
a few little stories about how I got an

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,000
interest in accessibility then I'll talk

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,939
about why do BBC News and a couple of

33
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,479
examples of the work we do there and

34
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,360
most importantly I think is getting you

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,520
all started so if you haven't started at

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,590
all so well what was great about this

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,090
conference is that earlier on on the

38
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,329
first day we had awesome talks showing

39
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,950
you screen readers and and things like

40
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,420
that so you probably all have a little

41
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,369
bit familiarity tips so hopefully I go

42
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,910
into other aspects of accessibility and

43
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,459
how you can get started if you haven't

44
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,590
already

45
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:18,780
so so let's get started so let me go

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,409
back a few years before I ever became a

47
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,510
web developer or had anything cruelly to

48
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,790
do with with tech as a job I was at

49
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,930
university in London I didn't really

50
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,700
think about obsessively at all to be

51
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,340
honest like I'm able-bodied don't have a

52
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,109
disability and my only current

53
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:45,480
understanding was physical accessibility

54
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,120
like this so this is a photo of the

55
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,950
entrance to one of the university

56
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,920
buildings on on the front side of the

57
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,690
photo you've got some steps and on the

58
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,430
other side you've got a ramp to enter

59
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,440
the building I was like okay cool they

60
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,790
saw about things so people would

61
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,959
wheelchairs can get in the building

62
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,840
great right so that's all good right

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,010
whilst I was setting there friend of

64
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,450
mine had a chronic illness then needed

65
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,959
to be able to use a wheelchair and so

66
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,199
they had gots user and were able to get

67
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,790
up like a powered wheelchair electrical

68
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,160
just to be able to never get round which

69
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,190
is cool they were able to do that and

70
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,489
some of the lectures that they're in and

71
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,370
buildings are in were able to have the

72
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,359
ramps and they were able to enter one

73
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:38,760
the first month after that I think they

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,530
were gonna go to the Students Union and

75
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,419
this is where if you don't know what

76
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,190
super teen is like I mean they also have

77
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,480
like coffee shops and things but they

78
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,480
also have like the offices of like the

79
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,819
welfare offices for students and people

80
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,530
who can give advice to students they

81
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,019
need help so like you know you need to

82
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,829
be accessing them and the building had

83
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,440
lift so this is the lift which is

84
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,650
awesome but it is probably you can't see

85
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,030
from the photo and maybe you can it's

86
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,040
really narrow you can probably walk in

87
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,870
there but and the wheelchair doesn't

88
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,690
can't can't enter they can enter so it's

89
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,880
like someone's thought about one aspect

90
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,370
but not reason about how they've gone to

91
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,989
the expense of building this whole lift

92
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:22,720
and like

93
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,230
organizing the whole building to make it

94
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,540
work for with a left not really thought

95
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,880
about like you know who I did all or

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,590
some things like that so it's not quite

97
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,660
as useful and in addition to that so

98
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,760
that's one building there were lectures

99
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,760
that were up on like the top floor and

100
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,420
like rickety staircases that had to be

101
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,160
like rearranged and things because they

102
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,740
hadn't considered that one of the

103
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,250
students might might need a special

104
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,530
access this and this was I thought it

105
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,060
was pretty frustrating I stood my friend

106
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,620
was my friend was pretty frustrated as a

107
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,690
little bit as well the fact that they

108
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,750
have to go to each individual lecturer

109
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,810
to ask them to read to change over sink

110
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,850
to rewrite or in the rooms and all of

111
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,169
that and this is like like seeing them

112
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:16,210
do that just make me realize just how

113
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,500
many how many barriers there are even

114
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,510
even from an institution that professes

115
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,850
to be open and accessible and in terms

116
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,120
of wanting to have such a range of and a

117
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,930
wide variety of students and dive and

118
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,990
talks about the diversity of its student

119
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,760
body so that was like my first like

120
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,430
major kind of thinking like there's

121
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,590
things need to be improved in the world

122
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,690
things things like even places people

123
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,410
that that care about will say that they

124
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,330
care about accessibility really need to

125
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,700
need to do a lot better now I'm going to

126
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,160
talk about something that might seem

127
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,240
completely unrelated family tech support

128
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,770
so hands up if you have ever had to be

129
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,360
her family text the tech support for any

130
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,390
family member come on come on there's

131
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,880
more of you than that yes yes okay very

132
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,580
much everyone here yes me too I

133
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,630
constantly whenever I call family

134
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,340
members they're like oh by the way how

135
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,440
do I update this thing yeah

136
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,030
yes so this is a photo of Carriger city

137
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,729
close to Tehran capsule over Iran where

138
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:34,610
my family's from

139
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,509
and yes we've got mountains would snow -

140
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:44,000
it's not just deserts and so I visit my

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,740
grandparents and extended family there

142
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,979
and every year or so and when I do that

143
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:54,229
and usually I get asked like oh can you

144
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:57,889
fix something which is cool so first

145
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:00,650
thing so about a few years ago or five

146
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,780
years ago my granddad was like right

147
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,030
I've heard like everyone has email I

148
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,650
want an email account I want to be able

149
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,419
to email you I was like that's cool hey

150
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,789
awesome I will set you up with a gmail

151
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,310
account because I have Gmail and pretty

152
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,889
much everyone has Gmail why not

153
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,819
and we did and then I used you know like

154
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,930
every day up until that moment I didn't

155
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,330
realize there was anything wrong with it

156
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,639
that's all because I was using it it

157
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,159
like allowed me to have everything that

158
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,199
I want like so many emails so many

159
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,849
attachments all all of the things that I

160
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:38,930
needed weather except one I had to

161
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,599
explain how to do things to my granddad

162
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,120
and I realize just how many steps there

163
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,139
are so so if you haven't used you email

164
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,479
this is a screenshot of of like what the

165
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,919
web interface on desktop there is Bert

166
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,210
read compose button in the top

167
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,669
I don't realize like the fact that it's

168
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,469
system PO I hadn't noticed that about it

169
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:08,150
since compose I'm not like new message

170
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,979
so compose when you put like in Google

171
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:11,900
Translate it comes up like composing

172
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,210
music and so it doesn't translate very

173
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,650
well so it's like why I don't call it

174
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,750
new message it's kind of like and it's

175
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,099
just like little things the little

176
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,500
language that people use in a user

177
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,819
interface it's like things that I

178
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,379
haven't really paid attention to before

179
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,839
I just like I learn what it did and just

180
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,719
ignored what it said and I like had to

181
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,570
explain why what composition means in

182
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,089
this context which is really bizarre and

183
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:38,690
have yeah okay so that's fine that's

184
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,899
what I mean so that's what the butter is

185
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:44,130
yeah so that's it selected

186
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,199
and then I was like work a woman my

187
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:48,029
daughter and I was like okay cool so now

188
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:51,149
how do I email a specific person how do

189
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:52,589
I email you to have around

190
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,370
like my own my aunts and things and I

191
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,829
was like cool I'll save all of the

192
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,690
everyone's like email addresses in the

193
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,540
contact list I use like super that's

194
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,990
great

195
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,920
I asked me how do I find them it's like

196
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,509
well sure you just go on this and then

197
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:11,399
you click that it's like but why do I

198
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,120
click the thing that says Gmail and then

199
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,380
behind it there's a thing that says

200
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,209
contacts and then behind that I click a

201
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,680
forum and then I fill out a form and

202
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,300
then it will took a mute like why are

203
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,509
the five steps I was like I don't know

204
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:29,399
like I just got used to it it's like

205
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,560
that's how I just did things I just do

206
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,759
that and it'll to commute said it just

207
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,529
like for me it just said but when a when

208
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,779
I had to explain it it's like multiple

209
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,399
stuffs like that's a lot of steps but

210
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,769
something that basically every person

211
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:43,199
does regularly with email right you send

212
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:46,740
emails to people in your contacts yeah

213
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,199
and and so I'm like my grandma's like he

214
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:55,199
like clever he does lay laws and

215
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,420
contracts and stuff but in these indie

216
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,949
sailing hehe he's buying with like

217
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,569
things and lots of steps but sometimes

218
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:02,490
if he doesn't view things like regularly

219
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,680
like he doesn't need to check his email

220
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,589
like five times a day to be honest so if

221
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,240
doesn't do mercury then he forgets

222
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,880
well the like the million steps are to

223
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,540
do the thing and so I ended up doing

224
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,810
oops what I ended up doing is writing

225
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,899
out so I had to write it out like in

226
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,509
Farsi so that's the language over

227
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:26,370
including little title really badly

228
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,199
drawn like icons of like what the

229
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:29,759
buttons do and like what would have to

230
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,550
do the same in and things and I really

231
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,290
really like okay this is a user

232
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:41,850
interface with like okay built that had

233
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,160
been built and people built it for their

234
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,839
own use cases and not really realized to

235
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,569
all the different steps there and it

236
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:50,939
really made me think and maybe not

237
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:52,319
necessarily at that moment but just like

238
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:57,180
thinking afterwards a lot about what

239
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,150
interface accessibility means so it's

240
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,730
not like my granddad couldn't use the

241
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,640
the Gmail web and basically he could

242
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,589
it's not like he was prevented from

243
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,270
using it didn't necessarily I mean he

244
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,360
has bad Isis I had to wear his glasses

245
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,480
it's not like he couldn't access the the

246
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,440
website the service he could it was just

247
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,740
that by setting up the interface like

248
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,450
that it just made it a chore it made it

249
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,950
so difficult it's I mean it made it a

250
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,960
pain and an annoyance so you have to go

251
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,700
through that and so that made me think

252
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,350
about about how accessibility can be

253
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,760
more than just given people with

254
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,250
disabilities access to a service it can

255
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,470
be ease of use as well it can be making

256
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,440
people's lives just like more enjoyable

257
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,300
by making a use of tech an enjoyable

258
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,339
experience and not just like a painful

259
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,290
list of things memorized to have to go

260
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,839
through so yes so that was like another

261
00:11:51,839 --> 00:12:02,100
little aspects of of things I and like

262
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,630
fast food a bit too

263
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,520
so my first left web development role by

264
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,380
this point I had done a coding boot camp

265
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,410
because I knew I really wanted to do web

266
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,310
development but didn't really have the

267
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,839
specific skill scale to get a job so I

268
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,250
did one of those for three months and

269
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,400
when those intense plans and I realized

270
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,589
that yeah I would like to work at a

271
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:31,050
place that cares about best practices I

272
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,730
could learn best practices for things

273
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,370
and cares about accessibility and things

274
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,839
like that and I was really really lucky

275
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,920
to and now the BBC News were hiring and

276
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,230
if you are not aware BBC News as part of

277
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,779
like BBC and BBC British Broadcasting

278
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:52,410
Corporation is is partly favored and

279
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,459
partly funded by the UK taxpayers like

280
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,420
the TV licence and so it has a public

281
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,150
service room and so it has like a like a

282
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,260
legal obligation to to edge

283
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,180
and inform and and also be accessible to

284
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,580
as much of the population UK as possible

285
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,540
which is pretty cool and so that's why I

286
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,220
kind of like was really excited to be

287
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,530
able to work there and I remember

288
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,470
raising it in the interview and they

289
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,900
like to mention it and they they also

290
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,570
really like the fact that that that I

291
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,040
cared about accessibility as well and I

292
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,750
thought that was a pretty pretty good

293
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,320
indicator of things okay so that was

294
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,090
that so now I'm going to go on to a bit

295
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:46,130
more about how things how we look at

296
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,390
things when we talk about accessibility

297
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,210
at BBC and BBC News in particular which

298
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,290
is where I work so let's look at a high

299
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,510
level of what types of disabilities we

300
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,930
think about most people like might be

301
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,110
more aware of like vision impairment so

302
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,990
blindness or partially sighted people so

303
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,510
who can't and view the screen very well

304
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,660
or at all so you screen readers and

305
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,570
other assistive technologies also you

306
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,100
have people who are hard of hearing so

307
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,920
it might not be able to listen to the

308
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,990
audio and videos and so we require for

309
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,120
example captions on video content and

310
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,430
and transcripts of audio content that

311
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,660
people cognitive disabilities so so this

312
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,620
includes people with dyslexia or so who

313
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:47,900
have autism and then also people with

314
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:57,230
motor skills and impairments and so what

315
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,420
what I liked is the hearing the whole

316
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:05,000
range of understanding the well

317
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,500
obviously this isn't like an exhaustive

318
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,310
list but different groups of people with

319
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,370
various disabilities and understanding

320
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,380
the different needs was something that

321
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,110
we learn

322
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,680
initially so now I'm going to talk about

323
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,070
how that actually okay so that's like

324
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,660
maybe you some of the audience but I'm

325
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,190
going to talk about an actual case the B

326
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,470
and I'm something that is currently

327
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,620
being worked on at BBC so BBC wreath is

328
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,660
a new font font family recently built by

329
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,170
the design teams heard the BBC so here

330
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,149
on the screen is an example of the of

331
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:48,720
the serif and what I liked was reading

332
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,880
what the aims so okay so the aims are

333
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,070
distinctiveness so basically what they

334
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,779
wanted to do the design teams wanted to

335
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,779
make it a pages look distinctively BBC

336
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,130
so you look at them and you read the

337
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,570
content and it's like it feels like

338
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,570
different to other sites okay that's

339
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,550
very designee it doesn't really make

340
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,410
sense to me but okay that's something

341
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,420
that kind of goes over my head but okay

342
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,250
I can understand the fat like this

343
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,350
there's also money saving argument

344
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,779
because Helvetica costs a lot to license

345
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,149
to pay for the license so they're like

346
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:19,769
you know if we do something in house

347
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,490
then it's we own the license through it

348
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,930
so we don't need to like pay tons of

349
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,420
money for it but one of the three cool

350
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,610
I'm cool aims which I quite liked was

351
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,130
that it was a legibility so to ensure

352
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,040
that this font font family is more

353
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,230
legible than the existing ones that we

354
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,060
use okay so to make sure that happened

355
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,160
once they had a like an iteration of the

356
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,350
font that they quite liked the user

357
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,209
research team light they they actually

358
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,380
designed tonight they conducted user

359
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:59,640
research so 36 participants yeah 18 of

360
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,079
them with cognitive disabilities

361
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,589
including dyslexia autism and ADHD to

362
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:10,199
look at to do in lab viewing of websites

363
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,169
with the previous font so the vertical

364
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:16,620
one and the new one BBC series and seek

365
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,390
your feedback on what the differences

366
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,770
were and whether I thought it was more

367
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,880
legible or less legible or all of that

368
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,190
and this is one particular

369
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,280
participants the sponsor wreaths the new

370
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,380
font is clearer to read more spacing so

371
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,000
the words don't blur it takes me less

372
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,250
time to work out whether it's a plq I

373
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,100
look for tails tails on the P's and Q's

374
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,260
letters to see which way around it is so

375
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,090
the previous fonts mate made it more

376
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,310
difficult and BB series made it much

377
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,900
much more easy so what does this mean is

378
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,950
that yes so even the design teams are

379
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,470
thinking about how to make this more

380
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,140
legible and how to consider people with

381
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,710
a range of needs what's even better

382
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,590
about this is that if it if it is more

383
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,020
legible to people with dyslexia say it

384
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,520
becomes more legible for pretty much

385
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,490
everyone else as well which is pretty

386
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,290
cool so so that's one so BBC recently

387
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,660
found that's one aspect another thing is

388
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,320
the becoming one thing that I found out

389
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,240
pretty much immediately when I joined

390
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,790
was that we have accessibility champions

391
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,340
which sounds pretty like awesome right

392
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,950
who doesn't want to be a champion

393
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,710
basically anybody can be a champion and

394
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,140
you don't need any like accessibility

395
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,390
expertise to solve with you don't need

396
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,010
that just need a willingness to learn

397
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,770
which is cool started off a few years

398
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,330
ago and now there are over like 150

399
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,240
developers designers and testers across

400
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,980
26 teams across the BBC service in sport

401
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,310
and music and and news and iPlayer and

402
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,810
all sorts of different products there

403
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,590
and also internal products that facing

404
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,140
other developers and other journalists

405
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,630
and things as well and so that's a lot

406
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,400
of people and what what as a part of

407
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,170
that is that you get

408
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,450
we've got like the slack to slack team

409
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,920
so there's a sports supportive online

410
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,170
community it's he so if you have any

411
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,580
questions you like I don't know what to

412
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,530
do here you can you can just ask

413
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,960
somebody there and there is that support

414
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,100
which is pretty cool

415
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,600
one thing that I loved about is that

416
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,610
initially first thing I liked pretty

417
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,380
much on my first month I was like I want

418
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,299
to be one of these so I want to learn

419
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,649
more about accessibility

420
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,080
I want to be an excessively champion and

421
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,269
then the first thing is called what's

422
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:51,750
called tosh.0 which is like which is

423
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,370
quite cool because it's like it's like

424
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,720
it's zero it feels like there's a low

425
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,100
barrier to entry right it's not even

426
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,960
tasked when it's like zero so it's like

427
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,039
it's almost like you have a zero

428
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,809
knowledge it's fine

429
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:02,970
so I really like I wanted to share this

430
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,470
because I think it's a great way if you

431
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,149
haven't really done much like it's this

432
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:07,769
ability testing for how you can get

433
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:10,919
started so you can choose a key feature

434
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,169
from your product so it might be the

435
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,580
whole page in my view specific new

436
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,760
feature and you pick five standards from

437
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,250
the guidelines right so I'll talk about

438
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,080
the guidelines in a bit this is learn it

439
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,370
like for example the news front page

440
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,880
this is a a slice from it so it has a

441
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,130
local news section which people can type

442
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,200
in their local area and they search

443
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,409
there and bigger like content that's

444
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:39,240
local to them so while their

445
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,639
accessibility guidelines BBC has these

446
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:43,700
mobile accessibility guidelines they are

447
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,860
they take likes the actual like standard

448
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,679
body stuff and make it like more

449
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,269
understandable so it's not in standard

450
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:53,880
written speak it's written like

451
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,970
understandable language and so there are

452
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,440
sections that are wrong

453
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,480
web accessibility and also iOS and

454
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,309
Android so you've got you've got the

455
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:04,500
verb so you're regardless of what kind

456
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,740
of mobile device project you're working

457
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,860
on and and like at the bottom which is

458
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,299
really pretty cool you might not be able

459
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:13,519
to see it because it's kind of small

460
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,500
there are examples of how you test

461
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,110
so like procedures like activate the

462
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,820
screen reader and fill out the form and

463
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,850
you check that when you have services

464
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,299
the focus the the focus guide name

465
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,700
checks that the focus doesn't move on to

466
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,880
different things that it actually stays

467
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,950
stable so it only moves when you

468
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,720
actually tab all you press ENTER and

469
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,580
things like that so it has actually like

470
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,620
skier step-by-step guidelines that you

471
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,720
can take so that was tossed area and

472
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,700
after toss area what we did is that we

473
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,290
we wrote down notes oh I wrote down

474
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,360
notes of what happened like did I find

475
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,740
anything were there any bugs did it work

476
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,580
as expected

477
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,200
did it do something that I didn't know

478
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,030
whether it was right or wrong but like I

479
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,380
don't know it did a thing

480
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,670
he's like the good thing or a bad thing

481
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,370
and then I was able to talk with the

482
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,230
head of the team the head of the

483
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,270
accessibility champions team right and

484
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,300
they are able to give me advice but what

485
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,490
about you well if you don't have like a

486
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,590
whole team of like 150 people which is

487
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,100
quite a lot to get advice from there are

488
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,830
other people you can ask there's the web

489
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,550
ally so a 11y select channel which is

490
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,410
like over 2,000 people from around the

491
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,080
world like including like experts that

492
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,250
write likes and some things also like

493
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,850
completely beginners

494
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,060
yes Twitter you there's hashtags I love

495
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,640
my hash tags and as we've heard like

496
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,590
yesterday and the day before these

497
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,810
abilities here based on Singapore and if

498
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,870
any of you are based here or in around

499
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,370
surrounding like Southeast Asia you

500
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,840
should definitely drop the message

501
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,000
because they would like to get in touch

502
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,090
and do to help you out with auditing

503
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:58,660
your pages okay so you've done a toss

504
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,160
your you've kind of found maybe about

505
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,320
maybe not bug all of that well what do

506
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,270
you do to take just full review of

507
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,110
things how do you how do you manage that

508
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,420
well we've got github repo with all of

509
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,670
the steps that we take for news so that

510
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,740
includes things like information for

511
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,660
developers for designers or if you've

512
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,010
got business analysts in your team for

513
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,770
them if you've got a product donor what

514
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,330
they need to be thinking of right at the

515
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,530
beginning of a product when they're

516
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,850
talking to stakeholders and and

517
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,150
information gathering things like that

518
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,400
so it's a detailed but it's also got

519
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,810
section those views so like for

520
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,670
developers it's got information of like

521
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,560
before development starts what should

522
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,670
you do like tortured tortured signers

523
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,870
about things before things have been

524
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,510
said of certain things like that and

525
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,440
then it's got things throughout

526
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,650
development what should you do

527
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,200
so there are also different levels of

528
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,070
things so on the first day it talks

529
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,960
about limiting I said like 'hey--

530
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,180
assailant there is if you use and then

531
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,570
just round talking about like other

532
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,100
premix so we use react on the server

533
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,940
side and so we use like JSX and yes lint

534
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,780
like accessibility lint so basically

535
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,600
what that does is that if you forget to

536
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,850
put an alt text attribute to explain

537
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,860
what images it like warns you one your

538
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,750
when you're writing on things so you you

539
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,580
find out about errors just as you're

540
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,530
writing so just like you would find out

541
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,380
about mists miss closing bracket as

542
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,150
you're typing and you need to fix her it

543
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,590
tells you like right up front so it

544
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,630
doesn't become like it doesn't build up

545
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,700
to have like a million errors and you

546
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,920
just fix as you go along which is pretty

547
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,340
cool

548
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,290
there are lots of browser dev tools

549
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,820
there's like if you open up Chrome

550
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,910
you've got an accessibility tab you can

551
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,650
do an accessibility to order gives you

552
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,300
like a score of 100

553
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,340
she's just give me or like a that gives

554
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,500
you hints in terms of what you should be

555
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,110
looking at this there are online pages

556
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,730
until so you can basically put the URL

557
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,679
if it's already live if your products

558
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,660
already live you can put a URL into

559
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,070
there and it can give you give you a

560
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,290
review there there's manual testing with

561
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:09,160
devices so you I'm pretty sure if you're

562
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,450
all web developers you've got a mobile

563
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,160
phone or a laptop of our device there

564
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,390
open up there and and and you can use

565
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,610
pretty much all iOS and Android and and

566
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,820
Macs and everything they have in Bell

567
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,020
screen readers you can test out there

568
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,179
and if you're not sure about how to do

569
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:27,100
that on this URL there are like

570
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,550
instructions about how to how to step

571
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,720
through that and get started okay so

572
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,490
that's kind of what you do when you like

573
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,960
if you're kind of by yourself you're not

574
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,400
really sure like and you want to get

575
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,500
started and things like this but what do

576
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,770
you do if you're in a larger team so

577
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,309
this is a few techniques yes so this is

578
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:49,990
kind of like when you've got when you've

579
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,160
convinced your manager this is a good

580
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,530
thing but you can do this on the sly

581
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,850
which is

582
00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:00,310
get in so accessibility swarms and it's

583
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,560
not as terrifying as it sounds it's

584
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,640
really quite fun

585
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,350
it's basically so this is the photo of

586
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,630
like a fearless the developers in our

587
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,750
team singing abuse with all the devices

588
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,970
out on the table so like a laptops

589
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,470
accessibility laptops phones the

590
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,180
developer who's like you're taking the

591
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,760
selfie was using Dragon Dictate so a

592
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,310
software that you can talk to at it and

593
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,840
it take navigates you through the

594
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,250
through the page so you don't need to

595
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,720
like use the keyboard or a mouse at all

596
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,510
you could just talk talk and and and

597
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,350
browse the web which is pretty cool yes

598
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,050
so you can do that and the reason why

599
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,240
this is really fun it really changed the

600
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,330
way like we look to accessibility

601
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,700
reviewing products is that it became a

602
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,470
fun activity it didn't become like a

603
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,120
chore that you just like cut it like

604
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,010
tick off with we could merge a code it

605
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,930
became like you like look forward to

606
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,660
like the two hours in the afternoon that

607
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,190
you had had packed in your calendar

608
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,630
because like yeah you get to like you

609
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,890
get to like try other thing and you get

610
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,900
to laugh and you get to like make fun of

611
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,530
somebody like using trying to teach the

612
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,510
dictation software and it can understand

613
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,080
this accent and it's really great yeah

614
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,030
but it's cool because it's like it's

615
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,590
it's a lot of fun and it can make

616
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,970
something that I think a lot of people

617
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,410
think there's quite tedious into a

618
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:22,610
really enjoyable activity and it's work

619
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,630
these are devices that we have if you've

620
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,610
got budget then you can probably get a

621
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,280
whole lot about the device like yes

622
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,650
if you don't just using what you have is

623
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,950
fine we have a device metrics that we

624
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,940
use so we actually look at what what

625
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,010
devices are most commonly used in the UK

626
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,900
what what assistive tech has miss

627
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,640
colonies in UK because that's why I call

628
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,270
me an audience there and and prioritize

629
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,710
them so we've got like a priority one

630
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,390
level and a priority to level and things

631
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,440
like that so you can go into a lot more

632
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,750
detail rather than if you've got that

633
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,490
the stats for there

634
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,560
and then if you've got a little bit more

635
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,530
budget you can do user research so this

636
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,810
photo is of a user research laboratory

637
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,120
so in London it's got a one-way mirror

638
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,790
which is the coolest thing it was like

639
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,350
so we're so we're sitting on one side of

640
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,170
the one-way mirror and the participants

641
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,490
of the user research are thinking and

642
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,130
the other where the somebody like asking

643
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,170
questions and things why not

644
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,700
ask more questions more like guiding

645
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,520
them and telling them what what let's

646
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,450
use that and the great thing is that as

647
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,910
a result that we get really positive

648
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,950
feedback for everybody so like Nora

649
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,330
senior designer so French now

650
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,160
understands the payment that assistive

651
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,920
tech users of assistive tech can go to

652
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,430
to access content so so that's great

653
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,380
because the thing is is that we want to

654
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,930
like not only is they use the research

655
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,610
good for us to find out what bugs we

656
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,380
have in our software but it's also

657
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,660
really really great so that we can get

658
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,740
more people within our organization to

659
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,480
really understand why it's an issue and

660
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,670
like get on board and feel more be more

661
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,230
be an active advocates for caring about

662
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,160
accessibility to takaka as a developer I

663
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,840
found it really eye-opening experience

664
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,000
and viewing the user research and wanted

665
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,540
to apply it to everyday practice and

666
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,520
finally Allison was the assistant editor

667
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,410
so on the stakeholder side of things so

668
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,270
he invited people from from about who

669
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,860
her on the stakeholders as well as like

670
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,830
in the product team and she thought it

671
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,150
was really interesting to see what

672
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,430
particular problems they face and this

673
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,600
is like invaluable because then next

674
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,800
time and we're talking about why

675
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,720
something we had to like redo a feature

676
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,190
and things because of accessibility they

677
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,250
understand why and they like acknowledge

678
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,900
the fact that that is like that is a

679
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,020
totally valid reason why like you know

680
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,570
the feature is delayed to get get we

681
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,190
delay launching and things and this is

682
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,980
like amazing to get everybody on all

683
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,970
sides of the organization involved and

684
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,590
understanding and positive about

685
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,429
accessibility yeah like over half of us

686
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:15,140
does like this the first time they're

687
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,320
using tech and pretty much everyone said

688
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,350
that their level of awareness had like

689
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,610
improved drastically so that was a bit

690
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,179
of a whirlwind tour talking about yeah

691
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:31,190
well I think accessibility is important

692
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,020
what we're kind of doing that BBC and

693
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,720
just brief overviews about what you can

694
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,630
do to get started for free I'll share

695
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,730
the links later and feel free to ask me

696
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,970
questions thank you very much and yes

697
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,290
thank you very much
