00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,130

I'm here to talk about perspective and I

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,700
seen today's talk and I kind of feel

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,220
like my knee a little bit silly but

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,750
hopefully you'll find it interesting so

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,340
i'm going to introduce myself and a

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,820
really good drubbing grower I try very

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,930
well so I web designer like most people

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,630
here and i teach web design and in

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,290
university also community manager at

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,260
that part of university that's really

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,850
fun and well I have these ACA a visual

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,650
communication with other Photoshop this

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,220
exam and then I go google adwords 35 on

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,570
way to thing about me I'm a coffee

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,720
addict I drink a lot of coffee I'm one

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,760
of those harry potter crisis pants that

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,829
dress like harry potter from time to

18
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,610
time so and now let's go with

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,720
perspective so what we must wonder is

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,750
what is perspective and we're going to

21
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,310
look into the dictionary this we find

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,340
this the perspective come from letting

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,430
perspex Syria it means to see through

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,830
and it's an approximate representation

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,890
on a flat surface such as paper or our

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,830
computer of an image at a system by the

27
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,260
eye I don't know if any of you have a

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,740
study and television or something like

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,760
that there's always by white balance a

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,880
lot of things because everything with

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,920
you on TV your wee-wee seen on the

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,909
screen is never liked the icy seeds the

33
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,180
ice is with live in the screen there's

34
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,850
no left so now we can create it with CSS

35
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,400
so basically perspective have three

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,049
elements those are point of sight

37
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:08,999
horizontal line vanishing point those

38
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:12,930
are things of graphics to not really CSS

39
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,090
so the pontiff site is something like

40
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,540
this is the point to which and the eye

41
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,700
of the observer is supposed to be

42
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,250
directed well he looks so if we are

43
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,439
sitting down we have a different point

44
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,480
of sight and if we are standing we have

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,900
another different and there's this the

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,900
horizontal line and which is also known

47
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,769
at the horizon which are symbols that

48
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:40,530
horizon-- or boundary the line that

49
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,510
seems to part the ocean or grin from the

50
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,870
sky from in the shown in line so this

51
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,290
could be this as well and it's determine

52
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,359
I but the point of sight which is

53
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,430
determined by the real or supposed

54
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,889
vision of the beware so if we are

55
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:57,989
sitting down or we are standing it will

56
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,349
change and the vanishing point is not

57
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,739
this movie but it's something different

58
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,299
and is the point on the horizon which

59
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,099
receiving lines of the perspective

60
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,930
converge it could be one or more than

61
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,709
one and this is Campbell day or two but

62
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,840
in this one for example is only one and

63
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,739
it's always on the horizontal line so

64
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,180
they could be using photography as well

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,280
we have the vanishing point in the

66
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,760
middle we see that every line goes to

67
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,479
that point and there's kind of a golden

68
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,260
rule we must listen to that says the

69
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,449
upshot of drone a smaller as a decent

70
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,669
from the observing increases that means

71
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,889
that we can make em funny photo apps

72
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,319
such as this one or even funnier this

73
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,069
one so you can go and try this outside

74
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:58,500
and well what is perspective web design

75
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,019
what why am I talking about point of

76
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,310
view that well perspective and means

77
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,220
that we are going to play with the axis

78
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,959
of things z axis y axis and this seata

79
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,120
plane so we are moving the elements

80
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,289
through those those places so and we're

81
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:21,900
going to use the transfer property with

82
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,680
we know because if the scales things

83
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,789
xq rotate translate we can make excel ad

84
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:36,410
out of it as well mixing all of them and

85
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,300
what we must be remind is that the

86
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,880
original space of the element is still

87
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,289
occupied even the widow teeth so we have

88
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,509
something called transform origin which

89
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,320
has been mentioned today already it's

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,620
really easy we have here in both

91
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,500
elements with the same transform which

92
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,930
is rotate 40 degrees and scale 0.6

93
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,660
wasn't exactly the same but if we add to

94
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,979
this one a transform origin we see that

95
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,860
what's known as the anchor point or the

96
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,470
PI world changes so transformed

97
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:24,310
nourishing wicked boot and top right and

98
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,509
when we hover over it it goes the top

99
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,960
right so we changed that point which

100
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
could be also our vanishing point

101
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,419
besides between the things we can also

102
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,409
put percentages but we know we heard

103
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:42,720
today that there are a few badge back

104
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
box with it and but we can put numbers

105
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,500
such as 200 + 0 which is exactly the

106
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,070
same or we can put as well numbers that

107
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,919
are outside the element this element is

108
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,699
200 pixels wide and chocolate fails

109
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,120
height so we can put 400 even though is

110
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,930
outside the elements and we get this so

111
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,259
what we find here is a little problem

112
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,229
because when the element moves will lose

113
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:19,110
focus of it and it goes really crazy

114
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,590
like this so we must fix this and it's

115
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,900
really easy to fix and there must be

116
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,090
very ways the one that it found what is

117
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,750
in a father such as Darth Vader over

118
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,130
here so here you are when we hover over

119
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,100
the father we activate the return form

120
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,280
oh thank you and I was going to put the

121
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,490
boredom of the he has no children so so

122
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,320
this is our HTML we have daddy over here

123
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,030
we have the deal that we want to

124
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,070
transform so when we apply our CSS we

125
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,450
ask and dark that means the father and

126
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,350
when we hover over it we activate deep

127
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,320
that means this red one over here and we

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,520
change it so we can now put whatever we

129
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,120
want in from for origin modify this and

130
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,970
it goes crazy but we don't lose focus

131
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,270
because we are covering father or Darth

132
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,780
Vader so that's one good solution for

133
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,550
for that well how do we use perspective

134
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,230
with this is it could be simplifying

135
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,320
three steps first we create that parent

136
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,930
element then we apply it transformed

137
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,780
style / serve 3d and then we apply a

138
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,200
transfer perspective with a value so

139
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,120
here is a dolly which is red we can see

140
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,710
it if we do this is right we have the

141
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,410
zone which is this ring one and we are

142
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,750
going to work with a son once it is

143
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,120
applied from from Stanford 3d

144
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,660
perspective 600 and so we can transform

145
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,830
for example rotate the x and y axis

146
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:21,010
maybe three degrees and we get this so

147
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,110
it's pretty cool and it's pretty simple

148
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,930
and we can complicate a little more if

149
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,140
we go over 90 the element centers around

150
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,180
which is really easy we can also apply

151
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:41,890
transform auditioned over these

152
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:49,220
and it gets like this so this is an the

153
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,560
basis of perspective but we can

154
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,930
complicate it a little more because as

155
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,350
you see this is not a random number and

156
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,030
because if we change it will see a

157
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,440
difference if I could put a double of it

158
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,680
we can see that the the perspective is

159
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,290
less intense it's more subtle and if i

160
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,220
put in a smaller number such as 200 and

161
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,470
what happen is really strange the

162
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,460
element first goes behind the father and

163
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,800
besides the intensity of the first of

164
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,820
the fact is figure so what happens over

165
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,720
here when we cross a line is that we are

166
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,540
affecting the stacking context of it so

167
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,340
transform perspective effect and the

168
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,450
sucking contents such as opacity does I

169
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,680
don't know if you heard what a pathetic

170
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,090
office this problem as well so we have

171
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,760
these things that prefer freely grace in

172
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,560
your stocking context and so that's

173
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,620
opacity and the value of the perspective

174
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,290
the terminal intensity of the 3d effects

175
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,930
that means for example if we are a

176
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,170
little and looking at the dog will see a

177
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,890
big 3d but if we are a human being we

178
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,710
may not see the effects so big and

179
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,680
intense and we can modify the vanishing

180
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,740
point or the anchor point and by using

181
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,240
tranform origin so and we can do this

182
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,740
really useful stuff such as a wiper this

183
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,870
is a car wiper doesn't really look like

184
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,320
this what it is so yes it's really

185
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,420
useful I know everyone wants to do this

186
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,870
and then we have black face visibility

187
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,660
which has been talked already and which

188
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,390
is really really simple so we have this

189
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,850
element which is slightly the same as

190
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,850
before and we apply transform rotate we

191
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,680
can rotate wine instead of eggs

192
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,110
and if we were treated like 100 degrees

193
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,089
we get to see the other side of the

194
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:04,980
element for example we can put like this

195
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,930
so everything is turn around and if in

196
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,490
in one case we don't want to see that

197
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,000
back part we can just tell it then we

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,770
don't want to see the back of the

199
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,410
elements and that could be done with

200
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,570
rock face visibility simply hit them so

201
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,670
now we don't see the back of the element

202
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,790
but it is still there because if we do

203
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,010
this with it until we don't see it

204
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,520
anymore so that's basically by back

205
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,220
fights visibility it has largely hi the

206
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,950
back of the element which of course was

207
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,800
unable to see before this property so a

208
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,810
simple thing to do with perspective

209
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,089
which is really nice if flipping a guard

210
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:53,430
what we are going to flip now it's

211
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,910
actually a letter and so this is our

212
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,620
HTML we have a father and which holds

213
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,200
all the elements and then we have and

214
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,959
another the evil is kind of hidden that

215
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,690
will help us to not to look for boobs

216
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,790
and then we had the front which is an

217
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,730
image at the back which is another image

218
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,620
so this will be our CSS this is a

219
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,870
hogwarts letter we are getting to the

220
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,470
school and so we have transformed style

221
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,930
/ circularly apply and perspective a

222
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,709
hundred so we need is first of all to

223
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,020
show in these two parts and we can do

224
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:44,130
this by applying position absolute so we

225
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,500
showing them like this

226
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,050
and now we have this and so what we

227
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,860
should do now is in applying the

228
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,550
transform and to generate around so we

229
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,020
will apply to that when we hover over it

230
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,990
what will we actually applied to hidden

231
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,200
because we don't want to lose focus so

232
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,970
hidden we have a transform of rotate why

233
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,940
because we want to rotate you one way or

234
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,110
not the other of 180 degrees which

235
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,600
should be the middle so we have this is

236
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,440
not quite finish and it turns so that's

237
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,700
okay so what now we need and simply to

238
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,310
show the front in the front and the back

239
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,550
in the back so for that we simply hide

240
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,290
and the back of the element with

241
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:50,920
blackface miscibility and now we will

242
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,810
have this but it's not likely right

243
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,920
because what we are seeing here is and

244
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,930
the front in the back and windows the

245
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,790
front if I can be back in the front so

246
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,320
we don't want that we don't want it the

247
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,930
other way around so it's pretty simple

248
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,180
to fix it which has need to ask back to

249
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:22,750
transform and rotate why another hungry

250
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,510
and 80 degrees in order to get the front

251
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,160
into the front on the back into the back

252
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,950
so now we do have the elements and its

253
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,230
really pretty on is our Hogwarts letter

254
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,740
and we are getting there so that's

255
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,710
simply that and with a little more of

256
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,740
animation and that we can do this kind

257
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,130
of crazy thing and it just turns around

258
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,700
it turns around forever so that covers

259
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,040
another few things and such as another

260
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,730
transformations and animations so these

261
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,079
other components are really simple

262
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,069
we're going to see them here this is

263
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,019
what we saw by now it's simply that

264
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:12,499
hover and from so we turn the element

265
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:15,920
this is what we see for now but we have

266
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,350
been working only with roti why and what

267
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:24,350
8x this is what we get but and besides

268
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,509
that we can also mix them so now we get

269
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:33,439
to rotate both axes at the same time and

270
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:38,569
we get this and besides there's

271
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:40,999
something else we can turn which is the

272
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:50,009
seat a plane so you can rotate ghana

273
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:55,819
cita maybe around 200 degrees so we can

274
00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:00,499
see it right so we can mix all of the

275
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:04,459
axes mix them all together this is one

276
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,249
way of the unit but there's actually a

277
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:13,339
shorter one that's rotate 3d which is a

278
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,889
really a little special we can put

279
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:19,550
something like this see your 10 and a

280
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,290
degree like 45 so when we do this what

281
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,079
we see is that we are activating the y

282
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,569
axis so this one over here refers to why

283
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:35,480
this one reflects two eggs so is if we

284
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,540
put 11 then we get this because we are

285
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,660
activating on both the x axis and the y

286
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,040
axis and the other one the other 0 is

287
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:52,220
only destroy mini-mental there are you

288
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,999
are the other one is the sitter plane so

289
00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:00,019
now we get this and we can also make

290
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:06,750
them separated like 120 50

291
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:12,150
in 10 and we get sort of this boring

292
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,589
thing so before besides wrote a 3d we

293
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,819
also get translate and translate clothes

294
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,100
we use in X or in Y and and it simply

295
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,050
translates the element if we put a

296
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,300
negative value it will go this way and

297
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,810
if we put a positive value will go the

298
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:41,610
other way so it's pretty simple but we

299
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,230
can mix it as well with other axis so we

300
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:56,010
could put translate y and then mix x and

301
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,070
y and it most a little bit more and

302
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:05,680
besides we could use translate sita and

303
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:10,680
we could say just 200 pixels because

304
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,990
it's better to exaggerate when we are

305
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,480
trying out the stuff so we can see that

306
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,200
it kind of gets bigger so what does it

307
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,320
get bigger because if getting closer to

308
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,980
us that's really interesting and we can

309
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,480
sit better if we rotate the element

310
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:41,910
maybe 50 degrees and rotate in a way so

311
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,240
now with that so they translate theta

312
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,450
what it does is m to move this part this

313
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,230
axis of the element and in awaken any

314
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,470
closer to us which is really useful when

315
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,610
we do something like this we turn the

316
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,280
elements around and it gets closer to us

317
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,320
and farther from us in the process so

318
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,510
there it goes and it gets closer and

319
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,110
further

320
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:23,900
and translate also has the short version

321
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:30,460
which is simply translate 3d and we put

322
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:39,130
different values like five negatives

323
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,270
let's go up and the other one it could

324
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,809
be something like this so we have live

325
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:52,200
thing once we modify all that we apply

326
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,490
animations we can create something like

327
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:06,880
that letter over there so that is

328
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,280
definitely a little short and about

329
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,760
browser compatibility likely is kind of

330
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,059
nice it goes along with from form so

331
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:20,919
every rose or a half the problem with

332
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,570
drum for property will have it with

333
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,370
perspective and so in WebKit blink we

334
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,700
need prefix did say the next version of

335
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,480
Chrome will not need it so lightly will

336
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,970
will not need it later and Firefox is

337
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,870
okay and softly internet explorer

338
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:45,010
doesn't we perturb 3d so and we can use

339
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,290
more nicer and another thing to fix it

340
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,700
well that's basically all sorry was a

341
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,500
little short and so that's in case
