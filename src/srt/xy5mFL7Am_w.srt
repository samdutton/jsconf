1
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,760

I'm very excited to send here a little

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,590
bit intimidated by this huge audience

3
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,050
yeah let's start off with who we are

4
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,750
what we do my name is fabian jacobs i'm

5
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,860
working at HX org on the cloud nine ID I

6
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,019
won't show of the cloud nine ID today

7
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:52,640
we'll just do some demos with it and

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,010
maybe you see some features but if you

9
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,170
want a cloud nine demo grab me

10
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,219
afterwards I will I will just do it

11
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,440
before working on cloud nine i worked at

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,170
cook sous for cooks to anyone knows kosu

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:12,259
in this room yay okay and yeah for the

14
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:14,990
online ID we built we obviously need it

15
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,659
an editor on that is what turn ours out

16
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,200
to be ice Kevin okay and I'm Kevin

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,909
tangora and the manager of developer

18
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:25,759
tools at Mozilla so this is part of what

19
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,350
we do actually when I started Mozilla I

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,939
started by working on Bespin so I've

21
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,710
been working on this stuff for a while

22
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,759
but now we've got a whole bunch of stuff

23
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,829
we're working on in developer tools so

24
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:39,790
that's that's me okay so code editors

25
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,229
yeah creditors are nothing new right i

26
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,900
mean we've got lots and lots of them i

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,430
don't know how many of them i mean they

28
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,180
seems like there's a new one all the

29
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,220
time so it seems kind of like it's not

30
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,170
rocket science and that's true but at

31
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,640
the same time there's a really there's a

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
lot of fiddly bits when it comes to

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,520
writing a code editor that's good and

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,400
usable and when you're building a web

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,190
based editor you have the web based the

36
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,110
fiddly bits right i mean we don't know

37
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,909
about those and you have the fiddly bits

38
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,220
of getting code editing right so one of

39
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,259
the things that we wanted actually from

40
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,750
the beginning of best bin on forward is

41
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,190
basically no compromises that we want

42
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,200
this to be an editor that competes at

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,909
the same level as desktop editors it

44
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,530
shouldn't have any you shouldn't feel

45
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,900
like oh man I'm really giving this up to

46
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,849
go work on this to use this editor it

47
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,220
should be the one you want to use so

48
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,340
that's what we strive for so basically

49
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,230
the ACE editor that's what it stands for

50
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,150
up their age I stood or cloud nine

51
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,489
editor but ace is a lot easier to say

52
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,439
it's fully featured so that means it

53
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,879
really has a lot of the stuff that

54
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,200
you're familiar with and comfortable

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,760
with and you'll see some of these

56
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,319
features in action as we go along here

57
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,029
it's extensible so you can write your

58
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:45,530
own syntax highlighters you can

59
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,569
aight themes you can write new commands

60
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,430
for the editor change the keyboard

61
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,290
bindings do all kinds of other things to

62
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,660
it so it's extensible it's scalable so

63
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,700
if you have multi tens of thousands of

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,590
lines of code in a file you should

65
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,910
probably make the break that file up but

66
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,580
if you do you can you can load it in

67
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,680
this editor and it's not going to crash

68
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,750
and cross-browser going back to ie7 so

69
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,700
this is basically code you can run

70
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,170
anywhere and that's one difference

71
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,270
between ace and Bespin was best been

72
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,739
used canvas so it didn't run out of

73
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,720
older browsers ace doesn't have that

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,959
particular constraint so I'll hand it

75
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,620
over to Fabian to do a demo ok yeah I'll

76
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,709
do a small demo today the goal is to

77
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,810
have like a small CoffeeScript

78
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,180
prevarication like a seat here we're

79
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,850
going to have to ace instances one on

80
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,800
the left where you type CoffeeScript no

81
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,260
code in and one on the right where you

82
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,860
see life the compiled JavaScript of this

83
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,069
CoffeeScript and yeah we're going to

84
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:48,590
build this thing right now but before we

85
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,750
can do anything useful I just want to

86
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,350
introduce some basic building blocks you

87
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,820
know what I'm talking about when I site

88
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,549
editor at edit session so the basic

89
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,459
entry point is the editor instance this

90
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,220
is like what you're dealing with a nice

91
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,860
all the time the editor is like in the

92
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,720
Model View controller sends the

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,810
controller it has a renderer the rainbow

94
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,239
right now is Dom base as Kevin said

95
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,190
there might be others in the future but

96
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,709
right now it's dom base and then there's

97
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,650
the edit session which encapsulates all

98
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,039
the state state is the document you're

99
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,020
writing the language mode of the

100
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,570
document language mode would be like

101
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,430
which syntax highlight is to use and

102
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,090
initation information and the selection

103
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,760
so if you were to write on editor with

104
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,620
multiple taps it would just keep the

105
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,900
editor and switch the the Edit sessions

106
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,820
because the edit session contains all

107
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,570
the state related to a document yeah

108
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,970
i'll just have prepared a small video to

109
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,610
see how the project can be set up this

110
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,380
is the cloud nine homepage

111
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,920
I'm signing in right now signing with

112
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,260
with github you can sign in with

113
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,330
password but it up is usually easier

114
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,000
because I'm always looking except no and

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,920
yeah this is the dashboard and I'm now

116
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,580
pasting the URL of the project this will

117
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,340
be in the in the show notes i almost

118
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,500
said this will be in the node so you can

119
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,210
check out the project afterwards and

120
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,120
it's now cloning the project on the on

121
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,970
the cloud nine server and opens it in

122
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,960
the ID and since we are going the demo

123
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,120
i'm resetting to step one so now we just

124
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,640
have like the basic application

125
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,900
framework and you see we have a as kids

126
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,650
sub-module but it's empty a cloud nine

127
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,020
supports a gift so it can just type get

128
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,260
sub-module update and fetch all the

129
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,380
dependencies of ace usually this takes a

130
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,890
while but fast forward this in the video

131
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,850
I'd reload you see there's the ace

132
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,920
repository a submodule and there's a

133
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,720
small server this is a small note

134
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,300
programme which is the static file

135
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,310
serving we run it and it breaks because

136
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,270
mine is not installed and we just do NPM

137
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,360
install mind

138
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,010
here we go hit refresh and this is the

139
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,310
candidate of the new npm 120 and this

140
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,060
installed mine on the inside of the

141
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,820
project and now the the project is

142
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,190
running on coffee previewed f jakub dots

143
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,770
in ohio if you grab your device go there

144
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,550
you will see nothing yet because this is

145
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:58,180
the video but we'll make it live now so

146
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,070
these are the preparations let's

147
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,199
continue from here so you've seen this

148
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,180
in the video I'll make this may be full

149
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:11,050
screen it full screen so pick the static

150
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,440
file server he'd run so in if you now go

151
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,139
to this link coffee preview a few cops

152
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,100
that's United I oh you will see this oh

153
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,590
that's not exciting because this is just

154
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,639
the boilerplate HTML let's take a quick

155
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,370
look at the at the layout here so we

156
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,120
have an index.html file it has a div for

157
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,440
the left pane and it did for the right

158
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,680
pane in the left pane there is a header

159
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,229
with name coffeescript and the div with

160
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,419
the ID coffee edit this is going to be

161
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,250
the editor and inside of this we have

162
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,130
some JavaScript code and the same for

163
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,880
the right pane a div a header and did

164
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,419
further for the editor and at the bottom

165
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,550
they are they are two files included one

166
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,650
is a Sun compressed the the package

167
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,630
version of s if you're an editor and

168
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,880
just want to a developer just want to

169
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,710
embed a sin your page we have like a

170
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,990
prepackaged version this is what you

171
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,599
just put in and it reference the app

172
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,840
chairs which is still empty like there's

173
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,820
also small stats fire but we're not

174
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,220
going to touch this so this is the empty

175
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,680
file so what I'm right now could have

176
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,880
written on my t-shirt yesterday so our

177
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,600
ace

178
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,919
so this puts an ace this has some some

179
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,950
convenience API which wraps some of the

180
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,599
stuff that you could do if you want to

181
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,520
really customize other editor and then

182
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,210
can save our editor equals a start edit

183
00:08:49,210 --> 00:09:00,800
coffee edit save it refresh yeah so we

184
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,990
have an editor it's not really nice

185
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,510
because this is just plain text but we

186
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,160
know this is CoffeeScript so we should

187
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,780
tell the editor that it's in

188
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,660
CoffeeScript mode so what we do is we

189
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:24,460
import the CoffeeScript mode mode

190
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:32,120
coffee and typos are we are done mode

191
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:39,410
thanks and then we say editor get

192
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,230
session you might remember that the

193
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,060
session is the one which keeps all the

194
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,800
state and the session keeps also the

195
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,980
information which mode to use so so we

196
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,940
get this and set mode new coffee mode

197
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,200
and this doesn't work yet because as I

198
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,260
said we have a prepackaged ace and we

199
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,450
obviously don't want to include all the

200
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,640
language mode in one big file because we

201
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,640
have like 17 language modes now so I'm

202
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,760
going to tell the index HTML that it has

203
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,310
to load the mode as well so it's mode

204
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,310
coffee and since we know we're going to

205
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,890
use JavaScript later I let JavaScript as

206
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:35,140
well

207
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:40,820
alright let's see if I made it right oh

208
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,520
yeah I did just takes away so now we

209
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,230
have javascript mode we have syntax

210
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,090
highlighting we also have stuff like or

211
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,430
to indent if I put my cursor here press

212
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,330
ENTER it automatically indents puts the

213
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,020
curves in the right line so it does have

214
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,110
some basic information support for for

215
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,190
coffee script editing yeah the only

216
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,750
thing yeah what what what I don't like

217
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,240
about this it's the the colors I don't

218
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,950
don't really match what I have in mind

219
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,370
ace supports a bunch of teams basically

220
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,890
we support textmate themes which can be

221
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,560
converted into a steams and i'm going to

222
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,230
use slightly more beautiful one it's a

223
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:37,440
the Twilight theme from textmate

224
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:42,670
and as well the language modes let's

225
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:51,080
first put it here edit or dot set theme

226
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,740
don't have to knew it we need to include

227
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:08,430
it as well

228
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,110
yeah this looks a lot better this is

229
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,570
what I like so what's missing now is

230
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,310
doing the same for the right-hand side

231
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,430
for javascript mode this is really easy

232
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,740
just take this block copy it down and

233
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:33,260
then I call it viewer

234
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,050
and it's definitely not coffee mode it's

235
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,780
JavaScript much so we need to import the

236
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:50,020
JavaScript mode as well

237
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,780
and since we are only only want to view

238
00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:01,850
this I also set this to read only sit on

239
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:09,800
this net

240
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:16,650
right oh yeah this is jay is edit yeah

241
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,330
we already imported the javascript mode

242
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,970
and their HTML files so now yeah that's

243
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,850
basically that's how the UI should look

244
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,440
like what's what we have to do now is

245
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,510
like hook up the the CoffeeScript

246
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:35,130
compiler to the to the coffee coffee

247
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,490
script editor this basically means we

248
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,770
listen for change events in the document

249
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,529
run the compiler take the output of the

250
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,390
compiler and put it into the JavaScript

251
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,970
mode javascript editor not going to type

252
00:13:47,970 --> 00:14:00,490
this now just check out the step step Oh

253
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:14,230
get research out and it's gone okay

254
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,390
yeah you see now the CoffeeScript this

255
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,800
is the package coffee script file just

256
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,570
download it from the website see in the

257
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,060
index HTML just put in the CoffeeScript

258
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,440
is the FJ has changed a little bit so

259
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,350
this is what we had before and here

260
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,010
editor get session gets me the session

261
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,970
listen on change events and whenever

262
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,980
something changes I call the update

263
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,740
method and also I call update right away

264
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,680
because I want to have it initially and

265
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,770
what i do is i get the value of the

266
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,050
editor session stuff it into the

267
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,180
CoffeeScript compiler if there is no

268
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,540
syntax error and go here and stuff it

269
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,290
into the javascript editor the lines 27

270
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,130
and 29 are mainly there to remain to

271
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,089
maintain the scroll position so let's

272
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,620
see if it works yeah so now I can can

273
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:22,720
type something here like alert you if X

274
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,410
X we go to and you see it's putting it

275
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:35,500
here in the editor hey thanks

276
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,340
but obviously there's one problem with

277
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,600
this approach if you take a look at this

278
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,810
I have some eggs or giveaways whoever

279
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,170
points me to this can get a checks or

280
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,430
give away what is the problem with this

281
00:15:47,430 --> 00:16:01,410
code yes ya know this code works now

282
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,750
it's it's in the broader scope its

283
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:13,620
performance issue okay exactly this is

284
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,090
this doesn't sound like good idea

285
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,690
doesn't it so the answer is I'm

286
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,970
compiling the entire script on each

287
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,410
keystroke whenever the document changes

288
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,500
and things get even worse I do this in

289
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,660
the UI thread so imagine I've like

290
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,810
10,000 lines coffeescript file type

291
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,760
something and then it takes two seconds

292
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,500
to compile it after each keystroke and

293
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,890
the browser freezes not so nice but

294
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,020
before we're going to fix it I'm going

295
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,370
to show you a little bit of the

296
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:54,740
technical details of ace let's go back

297
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,550
make sure to come come come to me after

298
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,600
their after the talk technical details

299
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,000
yeah as we already mentioned the

300
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,150
renderer is a pure Dom so but the dome

301
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,770
is used in a special way we basically

302
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,949
treat the Dom as rendering API with

303
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,049
primitives like lines and rectangles and

304
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,770
text and nothing more we start really no

305
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,600
stateful in the DOM and we don't really

306
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,179
we never read from the Dom so it's right

307
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:25,600
only fast which is really critical in

308
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,189
terms of performance because reading the

309
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:29,230
DOM is really one of the slowest parts

310
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,809
you can do a slow stuff you can do in

311
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,330
the browser especially if behind the

312
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,340
scenes the renderer kicks in and resize

313
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,960
computations are done by the browser you

314
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,120
have no influence on so we never ever

315
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,780
read from the DOM and the ideas also

316
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,919
that rendering the full document as dom

317
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,500
is just too expensive like have if you

318
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,679
have a 10,000 line document created

319
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,360
create Dom structure for every every

320
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,460
line of this this doesn't doesn't scale

321
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,130
so what we do instead is we only render

322
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,429
the visible roads this is something a

323
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:07,750
Bassman did obviously because if you're

324
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,760
in the canvas you only there's no point

325
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,070
in rendering what you're not seeing but

326
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,260
it's also something that other web-based

327
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,770
editors pick up especially code mira tu

328
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:23,799
from orion are here yay and also the

329
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,950
orion editor bye-bye eclipse from Boris

330
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,370
who is doing a talk later today they all

331
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,380
use a similar pro so that's pretty much

332
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,990
how you have to do it if if it should be

333
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:41,200
fast and also in terms of performance

334
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,620
yeah one of the the key concepts that we

335
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,330
had in mind was that document size

336
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,309
should never matter in terms of

337
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,830
rendering performance so everything

338
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,840
would it runs in the main browser thread

339
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,780
should add max scale with the size of

340
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,160
the viewport so if you resize the

341
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,620
viewport it's ok to get a little bit

342
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,790
slower because we have to render a

343
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,650
little bit more but if we double the

344
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,000
size of the document that shouldn't

345
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,480
should

346
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,000
difference but not everything can be can

347
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,430
be done incrementally so especially if

348
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,040
you want to do stuff like syntax

349
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,430
checking our jslint stuff this is only

350
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,380
possible if you pass the whole document

351
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,880
and that's where web brokers I really

352
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,810
need it and that's where yeah without

353
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,150
web workers a lot of the cool stuff that

354
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,670
we are that we have implemented and that

355
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,050
we're going to implement in the future

356
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,240
would simply not be possible because of

357
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,010
the the problem I mentioned before other

358
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,810
your eyes thread simply blocking us and

359
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,340
the way we do this is we have

360
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,800
infrastructure for web workers basically

361
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,510
the edit session has reference to the

362
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,220
document that that is what I explained

363
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,440
before and the worker for example

364
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,530
JavaScript parser is connected to the

365
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,480
edit session whatever something changes

366
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,270
in the document the work is notified but

367
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,820
since the workout that cat doesn't share

368
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,430
any any memory that worker cannot simply

369
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,200
access the document instead the worker

370
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,870
keeps a mirror of the original document

371
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,450
and basically the the change events

372
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,910
emitted by by the document which also go

373
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,220
into the under stick are intercepted and

374
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,140
sent to the worker and the workout then

375
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,780
keeps a mirrored version of the document

376
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,080
and whenever the workout decides that

377
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,320
some and some stuff needs to be done on

378
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,690
the document and simply can use its

379
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,370
local version and then send events back

380
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,800
to the main thread like there's a syntax

381
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,840
error in line 10 or there's a missing

382
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:47,170
semicolon in line 20 stuff like this so

383
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,630
which brings me back to the to the

384
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:56,690
source code

385
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,690
by the way everything I do here sissy is

386
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,000
online this is this is running on our

387
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,070
server I'm not running anything locally

388
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,320
yeah which is certainly good testimony

389
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,549
to the Wi-Fi here because that doesn't

390
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:14,710
work in every yeah yeah I was a little

391
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,840
bit scared to do this over the Wi-Fi and

392
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,299
had a back-up plan but the boy was so

393
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:21,520
good so I thought it would be brave to

394
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,130
do this yeah i just checked out the the

395
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,350
last version you see 22 files have been

396
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,360
added there's coffee jrs which basically

397
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,210
extends the existing CoffeeScript mode

398
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,270
in eighth and overrides the creative

399
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,090
work of method so this is subclass of

400
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,409
the build and a smoker and you see here

401
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:50,350
it's creating the work a client and then

402
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,990
what I said when the document changes

403
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,480
it's sending the deltas to to the

404
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,830
workers of the work it can keep the

405
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,990
mirror and on the other hand the work

406
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,320
itself emits events in this case the

407
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,830
worker emits an error event for for

408
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,289
syntax errors so when the JavaScript

409
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:15,220
compiler cannot pass the document syntax

410
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,279
errors are returned and we're using the

411
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,070
set annotation function of ace so you

412
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,909
can see annotations like these here

413
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,730
unnecessary semicolon this is this will

414
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,039
be shown as error in the in the editor

415
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,559
and the other event fired by the the

416
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,000
worker is the joyous event which is

417
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,770
emitted whenever the pass was successful

418
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,490
and in the data a part of the event is

419
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,380
the the fully passed JavaScript version

420
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,279
of the coffee script file so this is

421
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,220
like the modified version of the

422
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,809
CoffeeScript mode the actual work out

423
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:56,470
looks like this let's concentrate just

424
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,659
on the one update function don't update

425
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:00,279
function is very similar to the update

426
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,470
function I've shown before which run in

427
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,990
the fjs it's grabbing the value

428
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,110
compiling it with coffee script then if

429
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,990
an error q

430
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,929
I don't ignore it like before instead I

431
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:15,860
do some regular records magic to find

432
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,690
out which line the era was what exactly

433
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,240
the error metric message was and send it

434
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,720
back to the editor and otherwise I just

435
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,480
omit the compiled JavaScript and in the

436
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,040
the fjs I need to reload this far here

437
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,870
this is a lot cleaner now what I were to

438
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,330
do is I simply listen on the Jays event

439
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,120
which is propagated from the worker and

440
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,480
whenever this event is emitted the value

441
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,360
I take the value from the event and put

442
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,330
it into the javascript editor so when I

443
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,059
reload know basically nothing has really

444
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:06,110
changed so it still looks yeah it took a

445
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,020
little it still still looks exactly the

446
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,660
same except that if I make a syntax

447
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,500
error now you see that it's putting

448
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,200
unexpected identifier Jeremy are you

449
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,760
here I would like to have better error

450
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,740
messages otherwise coffeescript really

451
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,850
rocks and if i type here for example in

452
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,820
this array see that it's no it doesn't

453
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:42,380
update oh that's your next error oh yes

454
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,100
still syntax errors

455
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,049
yeah it updates the right paint but now

456
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:52,740
the difference is that it never locks my

457
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,750
typing so I don't don't feel any like

458
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,820
when i type because all the heavy

459
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,630
computations are done in the background

460
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,179
so this is the final version you can

461
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:07,260
I've put it on github I'll post the I

462
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:13,020
show the link in the last slide right so

463
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,350
Kevin maybe you can show some of the the

464
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,650
other ace features all right so yeah so

465
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,540
that's a good introduction to how you

466
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,340
can integrate ace and extend on it i'm

467
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,320
just going to show a few other features

468
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,330
that you can use an ace that are kind of

469
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,270
interesting so for people who saw best

470
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,880
bin as it was a couple years ago there

471
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,200
was a command line that was one of the

472
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,240
somewhat unique features there's a

473
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,710
command line because editors often grow

474
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,960
a lot of features and so that command

475
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,309
line is still available if you want to

476
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,890
use it and basically in this case we're

477
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,179
taking the replace all command you can

478
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,340
see that not only does this command line

479
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,809
give you help but it actually gives you

480
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:50,429
a form you can fill out if you prefer to

481
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:53,460
use a GUI and one other thing that comes

482
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,870
along with that is that if you want to

483
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,880
not have the command line there you can

484
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,460
basically run you could make it so you

485
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:06,150
could run editor commands oh a race

486
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:14,400
against time um let's see let's get this

487
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:24,440
playing again oh I want okay

488
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,350
well anyway what I was saying about the

489
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,470
command line it was that the really cool

490
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,730
thing about that is that you could have

491
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,159
you could basically have a pop-up of

492
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,570
that gooey window that had to replace

493
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,389
all command input without having the

494
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,710
command line if you want it but of

495
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,789
course the command line is great because

496
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:41,860
if you have a command line that

497
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,779
basically means that people can run any

498
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:45,820
command I'm using keyboard access and

499
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,899
they can discover the commands really

500
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,039
easily through the help command and all

501
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,139
that so that's that's a pretty cool

502
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:52,570
feature and you can use it you know if

503
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,950
you're not actually it's an optional

504
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,129
module and you can see that you know

505
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:58,419
running replace all doesn't back to

506
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,490
replace all and really pretty much all

507
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,019
the editor commands everything you do in

508
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:03,820
the editor is this sort of command you

509
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,179
can that you can actually use this way

510
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,889
another feature i want to show off is

511
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:10,480
something that a long time best Minh

512
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,820
contributor just contributed it's

513
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,289
basically code folding Julian furyk

514
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:18,309
coded this up in just a few days it's

515
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:20,230
pretty amazing now the way that code

516
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,119
folding is implemented right now is

517
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,980
unstructured code folding or what

518
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,529
Wikipedia calls user folding where

519
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:28,240
basically you can select any arbitrary

520
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,610
range of text and say fold this and it

521
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,769
does it drink sit down so it means you

522
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:34,029
can shrink down argument lists if you

523
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,980
want you could shrink down blocks of

524
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,139
code the great thing about this

525
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:39,940
implementation is that that means you

526
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,049
know we're probably most people probably

527
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:42,999
used to structured code folding where

528
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:44,110
it's based on your program structure

529
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,299
it's very easy to implement structured

530
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:47,919
folding on top of this kind of folding

531
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,480
it'd be hard to go the other way around

532
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,419
so so that's a pretty cool feature that

533
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:54,159
that just recently landed in the tree

534
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,070
yeah this week actually yeah just a few

535
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,279
days ago and the last thing I wanna show

536
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:04,149
is basically a Firefox plug-in made by

537
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:07,779
goes on github basically it has VI key

538
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:10,990
bindings because he really likes VI so

539
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,759
that's one of the unique features about

540
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,619
aces that you can you can do VI or emacs

541
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:17,409
tile key bindings if you like and that's

542
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:18,580
the way this one works you can see I'm

543
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,590
pressing like a scape kkkk to move up

544
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,169
and odo open the line so that's pretty

545
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,149
cool but the interesting thing also

546
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:26,619
about this is that he made it this is

547
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:29,080
actually a Firefox add-on so if you put

548
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,179
edit colon in front of the URL it'll

549
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:33,039
download that file and then let you edit

550
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,540
it so that's

551
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,550
kind of need okay so we're just going to

552
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,780
talk a little bit about the past present

553
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,410
and future of the project so i'll just

554
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,270
start with the past so to paraphrase

555
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,670
carl sagan if you want to build a co

556
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,780
deter from scratch you need to first

557
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,240
create the universe so 13.7 billion

558
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,150
years ago we had a universe created but

559
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,410
in the dinosaurs would love this editor

560
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,700
if they weren't so busy eating things

561
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,700
and then 230,000 years ago humans came

562
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,950
along I was probably a good thing bacon

563
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,550
everything is better with bacon 1770

564
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,650
1983 the a-team who wasn't influenced by

565
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,260
the a-team these guys probably were

566
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,060
benin dion yes so now we get into

567
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,790
something actually relevant svet bed and

568
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,670
dion in two thousand eight or so

569
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,930
basically we're thinking wow you know

570
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,850
the web has all these cool things all

571
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,070
this new technology like canvas and

572
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,910
things like that that we can use

573
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,890
wouldn't be cool if we could do all of

574
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,570
our editing in the web browser we could

575
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,580
do all of our coding in the cloud and so

576
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,220
they whipped it up and then they tried

577
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,660
to figure out what to do with it and one

578
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,950
of what they decided to do with it was

579
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,310
to bring it to Mozilla so in 2009 best

580
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,700
been made its launch into the world as a

581
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,040
mozilla labs project so over the course

582
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,410
of 2009 we were busy figuring out doing

583
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,460
all kinds of experiments with it

584
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,340
figuring out where we want to take it

585
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,570
what made sense for Mozilla what made

586
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,690
sense for the project and then in 2010

587
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,970
we had some ideas what we wanted there

588
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,950
and that became Mozilla skywriter

589
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,490
basically a more fully fledged project

590
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,630
because we had kind of had a better idea

591
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,490
of what it was all about and at that

592
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,990
point we're really much more focused in

593
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,750
the embedding case and we were thinking

594
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,010
kind of toying with the idea maybe we'd

595
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,410
have a server side that's based a node

596
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,890
and things like that and then jst you in

597
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,930
Berlin just a few months ago we met

598
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,270
these guys who actually had the server

599
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,440
side that we were imagining they were

600
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,940
actually using webdav the same way we

601
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,250
were thinking up and we thought hey this

602
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,510
is great you know we might as well work

603
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,340
together on this because we're really

604
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,260
heading in the same direction and so

605
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,570
that's what brought us to this point

606
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,000
that's you know how a sand skywriter

607
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,520
merged together so that you know we got

608
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,040
the best features of both so that brings

609
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,520
us to the present so edit a hobby yeah

610
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,210
so today

611
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,740
we have a couple of applications using

612
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,140
it one of my favorites the cook soup

613
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:57,289
playground now uses a CSS editor it's a

614
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,820
very cool project called source code

615
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,570
which is I think it's a chrome app which

616
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,520
you can use to access files on your

617
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,890
dropbox Dropbox account and edit this

618
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,909
boo days there's something called blue

619
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:13,220
Griffin it's based on Mozilla sewell

620
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,120
technology it's a HTML editor which uses

621
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,620
ace to edit HTML files there's our

622
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,600
studio this is really cool because it's

623
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,690
like a niche product for for the our

624
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,929
statistical analysis language and they

625
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,909
build language modes for the our

626
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:35,029
language for la tech for things like

627
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:38,940
three or four different language modes

628
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,110
it's used in the add-on builder at

629
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,980
Mozilla and obviously in the cloud nine

630
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,200
they also a couple of more projects but

631
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,149
these are some of the use cases we can

632
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:54,440
see is already being used and right now

633
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,870
we have something like 30 plus

634
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,480
contributors so it's really active it's

635
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,940
active on on github we have a lot of

636
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,669
Watchers and Fox are 11 number i'm

637
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:06,770
particularly proud office that we have

638
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,230
more than 230 pull requests so people

639
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,840
really contribute and this is goes from

640
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,140
like small bug fixes fixing typos adding

641
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,720
language modes to stuff like a code

642
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,140
folding are contributed by by you don't

643
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,720
fear which is like a major major part

644
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,720
and right now we have like 70 language

645
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,169
modes this week we got think closure and

646
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:33,500
okie are not support for the more freaky

647
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:41,690
languages the cool images and yeah for

648
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,419
the future we we have big plans

649
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,640
especially for the IDE we want stuff

650
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,850
like deeper language integration anyone

651
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,480
who has seen the talk by Peter fantasy

652
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,510
doing static analysis on JavaScript and

653
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,230
doing really

654
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,570
highlighting problems in the source code

655
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,910
code completion code navigation code

656
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,000
falling all this is something that we

657
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,040
are we are working on that should should

658
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,130
lend an ace probably by the end of this

659
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:17,540
year and one probably the biggest

660
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,950
missing feature at this point is

661
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,470
documentation best bin was pretty good

662
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,870
in terms of documentation ace isn't yet

663
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,430
but that's something we are actively

664
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,620
going to work on and that's it so check

665
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,430
out ace for kit change it send in pull

666
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,920
request just have fun using it Thank You

667
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:45,730
rose take me home to the place I belong

668
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:51,290
port the door again jazz car country
