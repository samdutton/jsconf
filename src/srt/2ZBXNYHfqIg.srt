1
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,330

how quick can we be data visualization

2
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,600
techniques for engineers so who are we

3
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,489
um a lease actually unfortunately

4
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:43,030
couldn't be here today she is in New

5
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,860
York and and she was not able to make it

6
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,480
unfortunately but she is a front-end

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,860
engine I'm sorry she is an injured

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,470
senior engineer at on Google's crisis

9
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,989
response team which uses software to

10
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:54,940
respond to humanitarian crisis real time

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,980
around the world and prior to that she

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,070
was on the maps team working as a

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,550
backend engineer I'm of knee and I'm a

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,110
senior front-end engineer for Yahoo's

15
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,180
tiger team and we actually go around

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,220
every three to six months on different

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,810
projects depending on on company

18
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,399
priority and I've been in front and

19
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,110
engineer for the past two years and

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,270
before that I was actually a database

21
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,600
back to web developer so I'm coming from

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,210
data the database world and this is us

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,130
at the last random acts of kindness

24
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,560
where we're very sleep-deprived trying

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,710
to get our hacks done so I want to first

26
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,660
explain how we came to speaking about

27
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,240
data visualization so Elise and I are

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,340
extremely passionate about open source

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,289
technologies and bringing women into

30
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,479
computing at the Grace Hopper conference

31
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,910
in october which if you don't know it's

32
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,560
the largest technical women's conference

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,890
in the world we both participated on the

34
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,840
open source for good panel and the panel

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,490
was hoping to motivate women there who

36
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,470
were very new to open source to become

37
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,630
involved in humanitarian free and open

38
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,369
source projects and at least had a

39
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,770
spur-of-the-moment idea to challenge the

40
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,509
women at Grace Hopper to attend the next

41
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:04,179
random acts of kindness event and the

42
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:07,270
random acts of kindness or our hawk is a

43
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,950
community of developers around the world

44
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,260
working to develop software solutions

45
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,180
that respond to challenges facing

46
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,940
humanity today and twice a year the are

47
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,500
hot core team where both of our

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,660
companies are founding partners hold

49
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,880
hack events around the world and it just

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,319
so happened that there was an R hoc

51
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,510
event happening in December about two

52
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,690
months after Grace Hopper and another

53
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,150
issue was like at previous our Hawk

54
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,099
events there were only about two or

55
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,780
three women attending at each location

56
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,660
so usually the number of women in a

57
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,580
technical community or work environment

58
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,909
is very few right and the number has

59
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:45,720
actually been declining over the last 20

60
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,390
years so we decided we would set the

61
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,010
challenge to an ambitious twenty percent

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,440
we would aim to get the goal of having

63
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,900
twenty percent of the participants be

64
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,240
female at each of the 21 locations

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,460
around the world and we announced the

66
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,230
challenge at Grace Hopper and promoted

67
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,540
it via Facebook Twitter Linkedin the

68
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,360
usual methods and also a scholarship for

69
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,330
one female participant and after the

70
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,700
event we wanted to see well how many of

71
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,290
the locations actually reach twenty

72
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,260
percent so in several locations we were

73
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,300
quite successful for example the Chicago

74
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,860
location where we hit thirty one percent

75
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,320
the winning the winning hack was

76
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,760
actually comprised for a four-fifths

77
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,600
female which was pretty awesome so we

78
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,310
also wanted to represent this data we

79
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,990
collected in an easy to comprehend

80
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,230
manner the data from our Hawk the are

81
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,120
Hawk event made it very clear that we're

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,760
really far from getting to 5050 in terms

83
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,370
of gender ratio so we wanted to present

84
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,990
this data so people actually feel

85
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,030
shocked when they see it and our perhaps

86
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,610
compelled to raise awareness and take

87
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,950
action regarding the gender disparity in

88
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,720
open source and in computer science in

89
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,200
general so data visualization is not

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,820
something either at least or I are

91
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,630
experts at or do every day and we have

92
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,670
like due to our day jobs we have like a

93
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,670
limited amount of time to explore but we

94
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,110
wanted to see what we could do with the

95
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,330
the data we had and we talked to

96
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,769
colleagues and found out that this is

97
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,420
actually an interesting problem right a

98
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,040
lot of Engineers even front-end

99
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,290
engineers don't think data visualization

100
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,180
is easy and we wanted to see if this was

101
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,340
true so we gave ourselves a challenge to

102
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,560
explore data visualization techniques

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,140
and the idea of the talk began to form

104
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,530
so I want to first show you the raw data

105
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,780
we had so um so as I mentioned the the

106
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,950
challenge that we put out was a

107
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,410
spur-of-the-moment idea and we didn't

108
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,210
have a data collection process in place

109
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,830
when we made the challenge we kind of

110
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,660
just did it so we had like an online

111
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,030
event registration system but each of

112
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,040
the locations people just wrote down

113
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,570
their names when they came in so we

114
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,520
didn't have an online record of who came

115
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
to see who came to each hack or the

116
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,570
gender of the people who attended so

117
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,400
this is a snapshot of the original data

118
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,310
and we have one row per participant and

119
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,930
but we yeah we didn't have their gender

120
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,750
so our lease and I went through like

121
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,050
1500 rose and manually entered in the

122
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,949
gender for each location and we

123
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:13,320
contacted colleagues around the world

124
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,150
like asking like is this mailer is this

125
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,220
female and we removed like as we learned

126
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,979
today there are names like Jan which are

127
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,229
both male and female so we had to remove

128
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,280
that data so we still ended up with over

129
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,650
1300 name valid names though with gender

130
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,360
so we thought that's a good set of data

131
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,940
and now that we had all this data though

132
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,199
we wanted to figure out a way to present

133
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,110
it in a manner where that is easily

134
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,820
digestible by the public and by the our

135
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,910
hot core team so we first aggregated the

136
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,919
data so we could see how each location

137
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,380
fared using spreadsheet formulas to help

138
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,960
us and we then wanted to start looking

139
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,360
at okay different tools to help us

140
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,120
visualize the data and we decided on the

141
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
following process we would start with a

142
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,620
set of tools to evaluate we would take

143
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,199
10 minutes to see if the tools of viable

144
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,849
option and if we found the tool to be

145
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:07,830
viable we would explore the tool further

146
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,750
to reach our desired goals with our

147
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,360
goals being one to plot the number of

148
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,909
people at each location to to plot the

149
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,919
percentage of women at each location and

150
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,780
three be able to plot both one and two

151
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,800
on the same chart from four clearly show

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,520
the gender disparity and five be able to

153
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,199
use this tool to easily visualize data

154
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,909
for future are Hawks because we want to

155
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,470
continue the challenge and hopefully

156
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,599
slowly increase the goal percentage as

157
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,940
more and more women at 10 and we also

158
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,650
decided that we would take like one hour

159
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,389
with each tool so if we could reach this

160
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,659
metric of success so the first tool we

161
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:48,599
started with was open heat map so open

162
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:50,699
heat map is it's an open source project

163
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,099
implemented by Pete worden ER and it

164
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:55,169
uses the OpenStreetMap tiles to draw the

165
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,659
maps and the service is designed to make

166
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,610
it easy for non-specialists to create

167
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,620
maps for communicating information and

168
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,169
we're like oh wow that's us right

169
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:05,159
non-specialist this could be a dream

170
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,130
tool so for developers there's a jquery

171
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,870
plugin that makes it easy to create an

172
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,210
open source mapping component on any web

173
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:12,870
page

174
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,670
so I want to show you a quick demo of us

175
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,990
actually using the tool with our

176
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,580
aggregated data so you can see how easy

177
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:32,420
it is to use

178
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:42,350
so I love my mouth where'd it go

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,800
mmm do you guys see it completely lost

180
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:56,650
it okay try again huh okay all right

181
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:03,400
here it is yay thanks so um let me make

182
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,500
it larger so you can easily come here

183
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,980
and you can upload a CSV so we uploaded

184
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,510
our abrogated data set and then

185
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,760
basically if it thinks the data is valid

186
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,890
what it will do is basically say okay

187
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,750
your data is loaded click here to view

188
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,890
the map so then you can view your map

189
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,630
right away and right away it gave us a

190
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,100
heat map of the data that that we had I

191
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,890
can hover over the markers to see any

192
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,110
specific data points so I can see the

193
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,820
percentage of women at each location on

194
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,520
the the large blue circle is Colombia

195
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,170
there and it's actually a really big

196
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,760
anomaly and we removed it from later

197
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,970
examples we did because Colombia was a

198
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,650
satellite location and it happened to

199
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,020
have it had one person there I know it

200
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,400
was a female so that's why it looks so

201
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,720
big but you can come in here you can

202
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,950
customize at the bottom you can

203
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,840
customize certain parameters you can

204
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,290
customize the title the color it has a

205
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,280
few color schemes the size of the

206
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,770
circles and you can also show other you

207
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,090
don't have to use circles you can use

208
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,780
blobs and some standard images so then

209
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,120
when you get your finalize what you want

210
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:30,700
you can save in view and while I you got

211
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,140
your map with the parameters that you

212
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,230
set this is nice big this part is nice

213
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,970
because it actually shows a nice legend

214
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,850
based on the data you have and we

215
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,590
actually learned a lot of tools don't

216
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,120
even the programmatic ones don't come

217
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,170
out of the box with a legend it does

218
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,430
have this weird thing I don't know if

219
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,750
you can see but it came up with the

220
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,110
weird name it's like do die Onision whew

221
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,550
I mean it came up with a weird name for

222
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,760
the the URL and there's no way to

223
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,130
actually change that so that was that

224
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,430
was kind of unfortunate so but as you

225
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,750
can see the tool is very easy to use

226
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,870
that was completely real time and you

227
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,459
just go to it's at open heat map calm

228
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,890
and I like that this map made it very

229
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,300
clear which were the high percentage

230
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,310
women areas like I can look in this map

231
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,110
Colombia has been removed here but I can

232
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,850
look at this map and easily see okay

233
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,500
northeastern United States a lot of

234
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,600
women attending surprisingly the one

235
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,100
data point I was really surprised about

236
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,850
was the Zambia data point in Africa

237
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,290
because I was like I didn't know there

238
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,640
were a lot of women programmers in

239
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,440
Africa but there were close to thirty

240
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,110
percent and we later learned there's

241
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,910
actually a blog post on our Hawk right

242
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,070
now on the our hawk website about this

243
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,140
but there's a women's group in Africa

244
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,760
based in Kenya carrot chicks which

245
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,500
actually encouraged women to go to the

246
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,079
hacks and I mean I thought that was

247
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,670
pretty powerful that if you have the

248
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,649
support team there that you actually do

249
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,350
have women participating so so far this

250
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,420
seems like a dream tool but then we

251
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,670
realized some limitations once you

252
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,550
create your he map and you left the Edit

253
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,100
window you can't go back and change the

254
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,690
parameters so I couldn't go back like

255
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,640
I'd first plotted it based on percentage

256
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,320
I couldn't go back and change it based

257
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,240
on number so there was no way for me to

258
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,500
edit it would have to create a whole new

259
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,670
map also since we used a CSV to upload

260
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,589
the data there's no way we can edit the

261
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:20,000
raw data so we could there was no way we

262
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,199
could edit the numbers like I couldn't

263
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:23,300
remove the data the Columbia data point

264
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,930
which is kind of annoying you can create

265
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,000
a map directly from data in a Google

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,769
spreadsheet it will as long as your

267
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:32,660
spreadsheet this public and then your

268
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,949
map actually does get updates

269
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:35,779
automatically if your if your data in

270
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,970
your spreadsheet updates and as we saw

271
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,949
the generated URL is predefined with

272
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,120
some arbitrary name so the solution

273
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,529
which gives you more flexibility though

274
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:48,140
is to use the jQuery plug-in right to

275
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,540
host the the heat map on your site using

276
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,420
the the heat map API how are we try to

277
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,699
use the API and we use the same data

278
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,970
file but it's it you actually couldn't

279
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,680
you had to understand you had to geocode

280
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,690
your data manually and you had to be

281
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,449
familiar with the OpenStreetMap the

282
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:07,430
OpenStreetMap tiles to understand how to

283
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,680
the API the documentation is not very

284
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,570
clear about that so we decided to move

285
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,480
on Pete the author he's like really

286
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,390
responsive on to github messages so it's

287
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,279
something worth checking out if you want

288
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,430
to look into it more so we realized at

289
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,020
this point the tools can be broken up

290
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,820
into two paths we would have the non

291
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,350
programmatic ones and the programmatic

292
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,149
ones and so we thought we'd look at

293
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,690
several tools of each type for non

294
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,820
programmatic tools we decided to look at

295
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,770
open heat map which you just saw Google

296
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,320
Fusion Tables Google charts socata

297
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,810
charts been in factual charts been

298
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,190
turned out to not be a good option

299
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,260
because it doesn't allow you to upload

300
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,580
your own data like it has some

301
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,649
interesting data sets up there but I

302
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:50,810
couldn't upload anything of my own and

303
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,760
factual was not a good option either

304
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,470
because it doesn't provide a map view of

305
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,700
our data so it wasn't a good use case

306
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,190
for us now the programmatic tools that

307
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,200
we looked at where the Google Maps

308
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,480
JavaScript API the Yahoo Maps Web

309
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,300
Services the Bing Maps Ajax control and

310
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,700
the Google charts the Google charts

311
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,420
tools using the visualization API so I'm

312
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,100
going to talk a little bit about both

313
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,900
i'm going to start first with a non

314
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,310
programmatic ones but i will get to the

315
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,160
programmatic ones at the end and the one

316
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,350
I thought this is probably like the

317
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,180
coolest find for me at least which was

318
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,560
Google Fusion Tables like at least

319
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,450
already knew about this but I want to

320
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,330
show you a demo also so you can see how

321
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:42,670
powerful Fusion Tables is

322
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,290
okay so i can come here let me get

323
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,500
larger again i just go to the fusion

324
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,649
table site i say i want to create a new

325
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,020
I knew I want to import data from a new

326
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,910
spreadsheet I select the spreadsheet i

327
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,700
want to import from and i can easily do

328
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,560
that the one so we're using our

329
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,690
aggregated data set again one thing that

330
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,850
and i'll explain this in a minute why

331
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,529
but we did have to add a column for

332
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,440
country that just had the country and

333
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,950
i'll show you in a second why I'm you

334
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,110
can give it a name and some parameters

335
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,690
and then right away it gives you a table

336
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,300
right and it automatically detects now

337
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,070
this was just spreadsheet data raw data

338
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,440
automatically detects that my two

339
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,970
columns location and country are

340
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,640
location-based and it highlights them so

341
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,800
when I go to create my first simple map

342
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,870
I go to the visualize field and I say I

343
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,339
want a map out of it it automatically

344
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,740
starts geocoding based on one of those

345
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,270
columns that chose location which is

346
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,610
what we wanted by default and right away

347
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,000
I get data points so this shows me

348
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,670
easily this shows me quickly all the

349
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,380
locations where the hack took place and

350
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,870
if I click on one of the locations then

351
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,120
I can see details about it can see the

352
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,279
total number of people that attended the

353
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,070
percent female now this is great but

354
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,450
it's not ideal right because I can't

355
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,760
just look at the map and see which ones

356
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,480
have the largest number of women or

357
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,630
which ones had the most attendance so

358
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,010
Fusion Tables also offers what they call

359
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,800
an intensity map and this is pretty cool

360
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,930
because right away what it does is it

361
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,089
basically takes the data I have and then

362
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,630
color codes countries by default and I

363
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,550
can hover over and I can see the total

364
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,010
number of people now the one thing that

365
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,650
was odd though is um it actually like

366
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,390
you can see here for Canada it's okay

367
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,770
because we only had one location in

368
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,079
Canada and the total number was 80 so

369
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,490
that was correct but if you go down to

370
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,800
the US it's only showing seattle's

371
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,630
numbers like there were way more than 25

372
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,670
people attending the the hacks in the

373
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,470
United States so that's where we had

374
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,240
that country column came into place and

375
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,100
Fusion Tables actually has an aggregate

376
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,350
option where you can select ok you want

377
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,180
to sum or over us

378
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,670
field and we want a son by country and

379
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:04,880
were able to see we're able to see the

380
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
aggregate data now the problem is like

381
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,089
there was some glitch so I actually had

382
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:09,710
to go to another value and then come

383
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:14,190
back and then it showed the correct data

384
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,330
so now i can see okay 377 people

385
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,709
attended in the US so that's actually

386
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,680
correct and it's aggregated by country

387
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,180
there's also a few other neat things you

388
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,029
can do you can see which one do I do

389
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:30,190
next you can actually view markers so

390
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,630
with the data not aggravated I can view

391
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,029
markers and then it plots points the

392
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:37,070
problem with this this is great right so

393
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,300
this is going to be the same thing open

394
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,920
heat map did but this shows the number

395
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,020
of people that attended but I can't see

396
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,700
the percentage of women so it's only one

397
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,410
it's again one-dimensional it's only one

398
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,910
set of data that it's able to handle at

399
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:55,490
a time if i go back to regions i can

400
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,980
narrow in on a certain area also so if i

401
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,020
wanted to narrow in on the United States

402
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,800
it has a you know a search assist and I

403
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,100
can see for each region how many people

404
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,470
attended I can also add a filter so I

405
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,179
know that our goal was twenty percent so

406
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:12,860
we have six locations in the US i want

407
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,900
to see how many actually reached the

408
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:24,660
twenty percent and i can see okay great

409
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,360
four of the locations did so it's so

410
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,860
this was this is actually being done

411
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,800
pretty much real time actually this is

412
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,740
all real time the earlier import i did

413
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,120
speed up a little bit okay now if i go

414
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,400
back to maps I can also do custom

415
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,470
markers here so this is like a great

416
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,330
playground for if I just and seeing what

417
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,000
I can do with the data so if you like I

418
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,590
think Fusion Tables is great like if you

419
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,240
want to like if you don't know what you

420
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,620
want out of your data but you just want

421
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,730
to play around with it see what's

422
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,280
possible you can use it to do that and

423
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,020
then actually maybe when you decide what

424
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,080
you want then use a programmatic version

425
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,880
like use JavaScript to build your final

426
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,890
version

427
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,960
so here I'm just I decided to break my

428
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,090
data into buckets and i'm saying i'm

429
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,010
going to have green pins for greater

430
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,600
than twenty percent yellow for between

431
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,600
10 and 20 and then read for less than 10

432
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,220
alright so this shows me pretty quickly

433
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,230
that the u.s. was at least above ten

434
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,110
percent in all their locations which is

435
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,770
pretty cool now this is again one

436
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,390
dimensional so Fusion Tables does all

437
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,790
the one you can plot two dimensions of

438
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,980
data with scatter plots and here I'm

439
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,250
plotting the total number versus

440
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,290
percentage right and this actually shows

441
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,520
me pretty quickly that as x axis is

442
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,200
number of people so the more people that

443
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,080
attend the higher the more likely I am

444
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,200
to get towards the twenty percent the I

445
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,570
was at least above 10 the there was one

446
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,100
exception which is Argentina which was

447
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,840
nine percent but I thought that was

448
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,220
pretty cool the scatter plot actually

449
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,860
info window didn't show the the location

450
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,450
so it only shows you in the info into

451
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,880
what the x and y value is that was kind

452
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,970
of a limitation here the pie chart and

453
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,880
the line chart I can easily see which

454
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,950
location has the most number I can

455
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,330
obviously India had the most number of

456
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,950
flat people the the problem is that or

457
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,750
Bangalore location had the most people I

458
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,480
think the problem is again it's only one

459
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:43,120
one dimension of data

460
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,200
okay so here again is the chart where

461
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,730
we're using the aggregated counts to

462
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,900
show the number of people in each

463
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,680
country and in Google charts there is a

464
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,720
heat map gadget you can use to plot data

465
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,270
and this is a heat map of the number of

466
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,280
women who attended aggregated by country

467
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,900
and you can actually access this

468
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,670
functionality directly from google

469
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,980
spreadsheets there was a little bit of

470
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,770
difficulty plotting the data you need I

471
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,830
so country code and it has to be done

472
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,560
manually and you also need aggregation

473
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,970
count so your aggregation count had to

474
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,470
be done manually also it wasn't like

475
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,430
Fusion Tables where it actually

476
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,520
calculated it for you um so for non

477
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,610
programmatic tools for heat maps it's

478
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,900
like Fusion Tables is much more powerful

479
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,610
than Google charts the Google charts

480
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,040
does have some interesting things that

481
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,820
I'll talk about a little bit later the

482
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,140
next tool want to talk about is sick

483
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,170
rata so Tsikata is a company working on

484
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,780
open open data sources services for

485
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,550
government and it provides a platform to

486
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,920
help you share data with others so it's

487
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,170
used by the City of Seattle you can go

488
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,080
to data gov for examples and they have a

489
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,900
they have a way dogs to also upload your

490
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,610
data and visualize them using various

491
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,830
maps api s it's a little bit less

492
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,720
trivial than open heat map and it seems

493
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,820
that cicadas main use case is to quickly

494
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,340
allow visualization of existing data on

495
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,350
the platform so you can choose between

496
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,910
ging Google and Bing and esri maps like

497
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,890
the upper-left hat is a Google

498
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,020
visualization and the lower right is

499
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,710
ESRI and three minutes we were able to

500
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,570
create an account and upload a CSV to

501
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,640
plot the heat map of the country however

502
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,710
however like if you want to plot data

503
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,660
that's in a location other than country

504
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,850
or a US state you are required to

505
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,850
actually geocode your points and it is a

506
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,620
little bit slow to render so it's a

507
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,970
great way to visualize existing data

508
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,260
sets but it's probably not a perfect

509
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:39,020
tool for just one time data use okay so

510
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,970
then we moved on to the Google Maps API

511
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,340
and we created a map ski to use in our

512
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,900
application and we found it pretty quick

513
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,760
we found out like pretty quickly that we

514
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,350
could plot individual markers of data

515
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,630
using our aggregated data set so much

516
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,180
like what Fusion Tables had we were able

517
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,030
to come up with the same same with the

518
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,559
google map

519
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,230
api so it's very easy to take our

520
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,820
summary data points plot them on a map

521
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,639
and open up a window with the number of

522
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,139
people and the percentage of women in

523
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:08,769
that info window so we first initialized

524
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:12,009
the map we centered around Chicago I

525
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:13,870
think here and then i set the map

526
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,340
options and i chose a road map to use i

527
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,830
created a new instance of the map in my

528
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,610
map canvas div and the data the

529
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,649
locations data was a simple array right

530
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,299
with the columns being location latitude

531
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:30,610
longitude number of people and

532
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:36,759
percentage so i plotted the map I let's

533
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,529
see so we just loop through the data we

534
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,710
create new marker for each location and

535
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,179
we add a call to set markers in the

536
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:48,070
initialize function so then to add the

537
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,100
info window we basically have a little

538
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,580
bit of script which builds the the

539
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,110
content in the info window itself

540
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,869
pulling the data from the array passes

541
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:01,840
the the data to the marker and then adds

542
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,330
a listener to so that when a user clicks

543
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,029
on the map you get the info window you

544
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:09,549
and add a new instance of the info

545
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:12,190
window in the initialized method and you

546
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,289
get the map we looked at before the data

547
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:15,879
points like as i mentioned still don't

548
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:17,350
make you very clear from one view the

549
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,029
number and the percentage right i can

550
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:21,220
click on a point but it's not the same

551
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,139
as if i was able to see at once so we

552
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:24,759
kept looking and we came upon marker

553
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:27,639
cluster so Margaret cluster is an

554
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,249
extension to the Google Maps API written

555
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:32,740
by Frank woo and this is a plot of the

556
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,269
number of women that attended each

557
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:36,519
location using the extension so if I

558
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,919
know that over 1300 people attended the

559
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,809
hacks I can quickly see with this map

560
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:42,519
that women make up a small part of the

561
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,159
total attendees and I love the graphics

562
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:47,080
but this chart still doesn't show me the

563
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,299
ratio of men to women so it's difficult

564
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:52,929
to grasp the disparity and to use if you

565
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:54,190
want to use marker cluster though all

566
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,679
you had to do was include one file the

567
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:59,080
data did have to be one row per person

568
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,360
though and what it does we had one rope

569
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,980
for each woman that attended is like a

570
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,710
JSON object and the marker cluster would

571
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,149
then actually cluster the data for you

572
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:09,070
so if you had 30 woman in one location

573
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,060
you would have 30 data

574
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,980
points and then the marker cluster would

575
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,870
cluster all those points and make one

576
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,010
marker for it we loop through each of

577
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,140
the data points and created a new new

578
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,140
cluster marker marker and then we added

579
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,640
the layer to our existing map the other

580
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,320
another weakness we found for marker

581
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,760
cluster is that there was no way for the

582
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,710
tool to use different data like we

583
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,240
couldn't use like the female or the

584
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,290
percentages or it basically used the

585
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,670
number of data points you had in your

586
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,240
data so and there was no way to use a

587
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,310
field that you designated say okay the

588
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,410
number i want to appear in my map is is

589
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,770
based on this field and as we saw this

590
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,590
was a result so the cluster uses both

591
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,900
the size of the marker and the number

592
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,540
inside and the color to plot the same

593
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,570
data right so it would be really cool it

594
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,800
would be a really cool extension if we

595
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,490
could say that the size of the marker

596
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,590
represents the number of people that

597
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,420
attended and then the number inside

598
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,830
represents the percentage of women or

599
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,240
something something like that so you can

600
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,170
see two sets of data on one map one nice

601
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,850
feature about the marker cluster though

602
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,590
is the drill down capability it provides

603
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,080
so when I was looking here I was looking

604
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,240
at a zoomed out view so showing me only

605
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,370
numbers per country when i zoom in on

606
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,320
the map it automatically I'm zooming in

607
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,270
the u.s. here it automatically shows me

608
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,590
the numbers in the u.s. so we feel like

609
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,540
we're making some progress but there's

610
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,060
still like not clear visualization which

611
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,800
shows the number of people who attended

612
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,470
versus the percentage of women so we

613
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,850
continued exploring and we came across

614
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,190
layers in the Google Maps API and found

615
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,590
a layer for the fusion table heat maps

616
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,440
so we saw the possibility of integrating

617
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,970
our fusion tables with the Google Maps

618
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,190
API using the fusion table layers class

619
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,080
and we're like oh cool you know we can

620
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,490
use the Fusion Tables we have we don't

621
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,770
have to you know create export to CSV or

622
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,960
anything and create a heat map with the

623
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,730
Google Maps API and plot markers on it

624
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,310
and we'll have what we want so we

625
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,960
started looking and then we found this

626
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,930
is an example Google Maps API with

627
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,760
fusion table heat maps and it's plotting

628
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,790
beaches in Brazil and what it's actually

629
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,890
doing is plotting a single point for

630
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,750
each location so much like

631
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,940
what cluster marker had you have to have

632
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,730
one row for each data set and so this

633
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,050
wouldn't work with our aggregated data

634
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,120
where we only had one point per location

635
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,270
so the integration of fusion table and

636
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,220
Google Maps API to generate the heat map

637
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,370
didn't fit our use case it might have

638
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,320
been possible to do with individual data

639
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,390
but i think the the heat point still

640
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,860
came out really really small so we've

641
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,560
got to multiply it by a lot to get

642
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,740
anything really visible on a map if you

643
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,260
want to do it though here's how you do

644
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,240
it and it might be valuable it's it's

645
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,300
valuable if you want to use your data

646
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,060
directly from fusion table so here I'm

647
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,640
just accessing my that's the first

648
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,760
parameter to the Fusion Tables layer

649
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,730
instance is my fusion table ID so as

650
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,380
long as its public I can access it and I

651
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,150
can pass an option to set heat map to

652
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,340
true and then I can add the layer to my

653
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,050
map so heat map is heat map the heat map

654
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,490
option is probably not suited for

655
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,790
aggregated data though so we then came

656
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,190
across the circle class in the Google

657
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,530
Maps API we started with an initial

658
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,720
basic map with plots of all the cities

659
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,420
and we use the same data set that we had

660
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,400
in the basic map we first plotted

661
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,320
circles where the size was based on

662
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,140
attendance so you can see here Argentina

663
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,140
India Zambia and the Northeast US had

664
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,340
probably the most number of people

665
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,090
attending so creating circles was really

666
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:56,690
easy we just we basically used we passed

667
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,310
the circle options where we indicated

668
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,980
the color of the circle the opacity and

669
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,230
the radius which we did still have to

670
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,580
multiply by three thousand to get

671
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,510
significant size circles but we passed

672
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,430
the sorry the number of people that

673
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,930
attended which was our fourth data point

674
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,170
in the array and we passed that to an

675
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,270
instance of a circle so that was easy

676
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,460
and they were like okay well that was

677
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,990
easy why can't we just do different

678
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,620
color circles based on the percentage

679
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,690
the value of percentage right so we can

680
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,190
do the buckets again so we did that

681
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,380
pretty quickly so we use the the fifth

682
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,450
data point to say okay if the percentage

683
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,670
is less than 10 color is

684
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,220
um read if it's greater than 20 it's

685
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,290
green else it's yellow and then we

686
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,210
passed the color to the circle options

687
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,600
to get this so now again different sizes

688
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,370
are based on the size the circle is

689
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,440
based on attendance but now the circle

690
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,970
color is based on percentage so it's

691
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,620
easy to view which places had a lot of

692
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,750
people and also to gauge the relative

693
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,310
percentage of women and if you remember

694
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,920
like when we did the open heat map

695
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,330
screencast it was Columbia was really

696
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,460
big but here now it's saying Columbia

697
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,770
only has one person so you can you can't

698
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,560
barely see it on the map which i think

699
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,330
is more accurate representation so it

700
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,530
shows you it shows you both sets of data

701
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,610
now if I want to get more detail about

702
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,310
each one I can add back in a call to set

703
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,550
markers and info window and now I can

704
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,650
click on each point to get more detailed

705
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,420
information about each map and you can

706
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,170
actually also tie the info window to the

707
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,820
circles themselves so you don't need

708
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,600
them the marker points and then and the

709
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,190
actual we have a blog post up on our

710
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,550
Hawk right now which has has this map up

711
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,110
without the you can actually click on

712
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,410
the circles directly I'm another thing

713
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,090
is the circles automatically scale to

714
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,300
your zoom level which is pretty cool

715
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,600
okay so then we looked at Yahoo Maps web

716
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
services and also Bing and this is the

717
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,770
first map we created with the Yahoo Maps

718
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,260
API so we had explored the google maps

719
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,210
api extensively and we wanted to see

720
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,010
what Yahoo and Bing also had to offer

721
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,340
and it turns out the api's are all very

722
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,990
similar in structure the function names

723
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,580
are different but the structure is the

724
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,760
same so um you create a map you plot the

725
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,500
markers at event listeners for the click

726
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,840
to get the info windows one thing I

727
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,180
didn't like about the Yahoo Maps was the

728
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,500
default marker so i went ahead and i

729
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,510
found a class to you that the custom to

730
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,270
add your own custom icon and used the

731
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,080
same icon that Google Maps has um for my

732
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,220
yahoo map and I came up with this and so

733
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,860
I like this a little bit better now all

734
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,050
the api's offer the ability to use

735
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,360
custom icons and it's done in a pretty

736
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,120
smudge similar mantle manner so you just

737
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,790
create a new image set the source set

738
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,010
the size

739
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,190
and for Yahoo Maps it does offer an

740
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,950
option to actually move your marker move

741
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,570
your window around like offset your

742
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,520
window based on your marker and then you

743
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,870
make sure to pass the icon to your

744
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:07,720
marker now when we and when we looked at

745
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,760
the Bing Maps this was the map and when

746
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,500
we looked at the Bing Maps HS control it

747
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,120
turns out that their API is also very

748
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,300
similar in structure so um this is a

749
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,190
street view but and one advantage that

750
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,170
Google Maps does have is the street view

751
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,060
so street views avail I think I'm sure

752
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,890
almost everybody knows about it but it's

753
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,360
available by default when you create

754
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,090
your own map using the Maps API and we

755
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,410
thought maybe this will be useful in the

756
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,260
next hour hawk because to use before the

757
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,030
event so that people can actually find

758
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,170
locations of hacks because you're

759
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,900
usually going to a new new place this is

760
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,520
actually the where we had the Chicago

761
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,410
hack in December is the cna Insurance

762
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,240
Building in downtown Chicago okay so

763
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,640
next we looked at the Google charts

764
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,720
tools which uses the visualization API

765
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,890
and you can use it to embed an

766
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,600
interactive chart graph or other

767
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,730
graphics on to your web page and the

768
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,800
visualizations are interactive and also

769
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,320
expose events such as user mouse clicks

770
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,390
enable you to write code to create great

771
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,390
effects on your page so you can embed a

772
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,340
visualization either using javascript or

773
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,950
an embedded gadget and when what we did

774
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,330
earlier was a gadget but you can also

775
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,910
use the API to build your own and host

776
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,900
it yourself now if you use j/s there's

777
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,340
still the same limitations we

778
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,080
encountered when building the gadget you

779
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,660
need to you need iso country code and it

780
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,040
has to be done manually and you have to

781
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,110
add aggregate the data yourself and that

782
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,120
also has to be done manually and you

783
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,210
can't plot cities which is kind of

784
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,010
limitation it does provide a pretty good

785
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,340
legend but google charts is a great way

786
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,630
to plot like multiple charts

787
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,100
synchronized with each other on the same

788
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,540
page so if you have multiple charts and

789
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,970
you want two things happening to the

790
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,350
charts at the same time it's a great

791
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,920
option and there's also it offers a

792
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,110
large variety of options like table bar

793
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,510
line and some interesting custom ones I

794
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,190
actually saw some speedometers and their

795
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,900
examples which looked pretty cool so

796
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,820
they're constantly improving so it's

797
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,640
definitely something to look at also so

798
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,990
in conclusion if we take a

799
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,370
look at all the tools together and their

800
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,190
capabilities when we first started out

801
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,870
like the goals that you saw at the

802
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,640
beginning we really weren't sure what we

803
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,100
wanted but those goals like we came up

804
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,450
with those at the end and there's

805
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,520
criteria that you see across the top we

806
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,080
kind of came up with those after we had

807
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,280
done all the research because we weren't

808
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,860
really sure but realized what we really

809
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,630
wanted was to be able to visualize two

810
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,630
sets of data we wanted to see if it

811
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,690
required coding or not we would like

812
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,220
have liked it to be easy to make a

813
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,940
legend we also evaluated on how easy it

814
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,610
was to create the first map and do we

815
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,920
get full control or not and you can see

816
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,200
from this that the more control you have

817
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,670
the I guess the more control you have it

818
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,290
gives you the power to visualize two

819
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,630
sets of data right because you can

820
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,980
really build what you want on the map

821
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,030
whereas if you have less control it's

822
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,550
you're not able to visualize the two

823
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,250
sets of data I think the other thing is

824
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,619
as I mentioned earlier like Fusion

825
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:10,179
Tables was really powerful like if

826
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,980
you're just exploring data but if you

827
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,690
know what you want then maybe then using

828
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,369
like a programmatic tool such as Google

829
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:24,070
or Yahoo might be what you want so some

830
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,690
more conclusions it's very easy to plot

831
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,750
flat numbers with most tools plotting

832
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,850
multiple sets of data without code

833
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,790
though is not trivial and flash graphics

834
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,830
still are ahead of JavaScript graphics

835
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,780
with respect to data visualization and I

836
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,940
forgot to mention this but Fusion Tables

837
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,550
actually inputs your data into a flash

838
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,220
object to produce those maps whereas the

839
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,649
google maps api is all JavaScript most

840
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:52,450
map and charting tools need better

841
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,000
overall legend support the Maps API

842
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,040
products are very similar in structure

843
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,380
Yahoo is actually coming out with their

844
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,750
at 3i think they're at version 3.9 right

845
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,619
now but they're coming out with the

846
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:05,170
version for which people on my team are

847
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,690
working on Budish and it's using the

848
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,450
Nokia the the OV backend so I'm really

849
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,690
excited to see with what they have there

850
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,240
we've Justin covered the tip in terms of

851
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,520
data visualization there's there's a lot

852
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,240
of options

853
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,090
there and that you know that one hour

854
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,640
limit we had set for ourselves we I mean

855
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,380
we were not able to adhere to that at

856
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,090
all because there's just so much

857
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,100
information and it took us a while to go

858
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,230
through everything and figure out how to

859
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,770
get what we want and our visualize data

860
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,330
showed us that the more people that

861
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,040
attended the event the more likely we

862
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,390
were to meet the twenty percent

863
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,270
challenge we do need to improve an

864
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,070
automator data collection process as

865
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,230
much as possible for the June our hawk

866
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,910
we're using a vamp right and we're

867
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,530
hoping to scan people in as they come

868
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,090
and we're also collecting gender so it

869
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,160
should make it a lot easier we

870
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,690
definitely need more women hacker still

871
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,030
and when women do participate like they

872
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,480
did in Chicago if they win okay that's

873
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,110
it questions so in what way was /

874
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,710
superior ajs um well it's easier to get

875
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,960
maps where you can actually color in the

876
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,610
whole region like if I was coloring in

877
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,380
the the state or as coloring in the

878
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,230
whole country that was much easier to do

879
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,790
I think Google Maps actually provides

880
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,950
somebody has built out where they

881
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,859
actually plot those specific regions but

882
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:25,720
it's not you have to actually use that

883
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:32,350
extension it doesn't come built in okay

884
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:46,440
any other questions okay that's it

885
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,860
Laura did you remember to load the bacon
