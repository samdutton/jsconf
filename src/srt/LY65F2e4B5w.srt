00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,939
unicorn emoji but there will be unicorn

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,039
emoji so that's super exciting I am a

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,080
friends elver at the bluemix teemed iBM

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,050
has started this a CDC meetup nhx ass

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,660
meetup and I'm also a member of the open

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,279
design foundation but more importantly I

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,989
found this perfect tweet describe what I

11
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,079
do from Horst is and what I do is just

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,480
breaking the web with CSS and this talk

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,309
is a perfect example of that so if

14
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:42,770
you're here to see some breaking the web

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,079
welcome welcome to get you in the mood I

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,539
have a video here I thought you was

17
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,039
getting to be a lady Photoshop it's

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,600
gonna be a pleasure to kill you or less

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,370
than your chrome in this presentation

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,500
give me a lesson in long distance

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,829
spitting anything you can do I can do

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,890
better I can do anything better than you

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,830
are you yes I can oh you can yes I can

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,430
oh you can yes I can yes I can all right

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,799
so now that you'll feel me now they were

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,869
all in the mood for this let's get

27
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,900
excited so last week I was in Vilonia

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,049
that is a huge thing of tiramisu it's

29
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,869
it's ridiculous how they feed you there

30
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,479
like it's insane I didn't eat it hello

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,600
and I promise but anyway while I was in

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,640
Bologna I won do some traveling so I go

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,829
online and go the Train Italia website I

34
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,200
don't speak Italian I'm so sorry

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,990
so I just had to translate the page for

36
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,150
Italian to English a translate of the

37
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,689
page

38
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,840
I still see Oh God I still see this I

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,840
could have blacked out um so here I am

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,030
wondering what does this say I thought

41
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,890
I'd translated the page why is there a

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,710
baby I just want to buy a train pass to

43
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,020
visit another city I've no idea what

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,280
saying and I get really frustrated

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,590
because this is an example of a designer

46
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,020
just throwing it like a comp together in

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,549
Photoshop and putting it online like

48
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,740
this isn't helping anybody here at CSS

49
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,630
comp we have over 31 countries

50
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,770
represented

51
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,780
that's amazing like coming clap for the

52
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,830
organizer is really quick for that

53
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:18,190
Oh like this isn't going to help any of

54
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,510
those people fine talk about loading

55
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,340
time so the average loading time for

56
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,460
Photoshop is 33 seconds but my favorite

57
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,680
part of this is not just we have to wait

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,000
and watch the slowed screen that we have

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,980
nightmares of they also want to

60
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,270
highlight the names of the people

61
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:40,150
responsible for this while we wait cool

62
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,280
thank you it's fine let's talk about

63
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,410
responsive design in photoshop we're

64
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,200
done talking about it

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,220
you came down with like a separate

66
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,900
application you could fake it but you

67
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,459
really can't do responsive design like

68
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,040
you can do in the browser and then the

69
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,370
price okay that's a lot of money it's

70
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,350
240 dollars a year just for Photoshop

71
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,120
alone I created cloud the six hundred US

72
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,750
dollars a year it's quite a bit but it's

73
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,670
fine cuz I can go to flaming text calm

74
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,400
and just make all of these logos look I

75
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,230
have like 20 logo options right now I

76
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,850
had to pay zero dollars and zero cents

77
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,120
for Google Chrome and this is the worst

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,230
part so I remember trying to sign in to

79
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,510
browser what I'm - Photoshop while I was

80
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,190
on an airplane I was trying to do some

81
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,780
work so it's exciting required that's

82
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,600
fine I'm trying to sign up my team and

83
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,769
then I get please connect to the

84
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,730
Internet and retry I'm on an airplane I

85
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,160
don't have Wi-Fi so what do I do I hit

86
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,739
cancel are you sure you want to quit yes

87
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,870
I want to quit and then this is how I

88
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,269
feel about Photoshop from now on oh gosh

89
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,410
so this talk is going to focus on

90
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,030
filters and blend modes specifically and

91
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,709
we're also going to talk about gradients

92
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,150
a little bit but there is a vast variety

93
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,500
of things that you can do in the browser

94
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,540
instead of opening Photoshop to do them

95
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,459
cutting images out there's so much so

96
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,959
I'm just going to be focusing on these

97
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,870
few topics and before I move on just a

98
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,820
notes normally I would be using

99
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,959
something like post-assessment

100
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,700
autoprefixer to take care of my vendor

101
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,000
prefix thing but I'm using just a style

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,709
block with constant editable and this

103
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,680
demo and just vanilla CSS so I'm going

104
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,000
to have to do some WebKit filter

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,430
prefixing so just keep that in mind you

106
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,400
won't actually do that in real life so

107
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,240
starting with CSS filters the

108
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,130
compatibility with CSS filters is pretty

109
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,199
good the only browser that's really not

110
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,199
doing it yet is edge but um hopefully

111
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,810
that will change so here I can seem a

112
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,030
little bit there we go

113
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,410
so the options that we have for CSS

114
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,539
filters are blur brightness contrast

115
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:43,630
drop shadow grayscale hue rotate invert

116
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,639
opacity CPN saturate so we have a few

117
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,500
different options here and just to show

118
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,720
an example here some of the more

119
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,580
interesting ones I find are like drop

120
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,610
shadow because it takes this shape of

121
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,919
that image so here we have a PNG and if

122
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,270
I move this out a little bit you can

123
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,099
really see that this drop shadow is

124
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,570
taking the shape of that image so

125
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,250
instead of a box shadow that just takes

126
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,860
the size of the box or it takes the

127
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,720
border size it will just take the size

128
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,180
of that image itself so that's pretty

129
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,919
cool

130
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,210
blur does what you would think it does

131
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,479
it works with any really unit value here

132
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,409
so we could do like 0.2 m/s if we want

133
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:22,210
any any unit value here so brightness

134
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,580
obviously anything that is greater than

135
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,919
one for brightness will increase the

136
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,060
brightness and anything less will

137
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,159
decrease it so a brightness of zero just

138
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:32,050
makes it black another interesting one

139
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,430
that I will talk about the highlight

140
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,849
here is invert so invert also takes no

141
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:38,229
parameters so if you have no parameters

142
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:39,880
in there it takes it as value of one

143
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,400
completely inverts your image here if

144
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,710
it's an invert value of 0.5 its

145
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,389
completely gray scaled because the way

146
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,280
that you invert pixels is you take the

147
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,349
luminance value and you subtract it from

148
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,389
one so right here when you do invert

149
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,770
point five you're taking all the

150
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,940
luminance values and setting them

151
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,180
closest to that 50% gray so the rest are

152
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,190
kind of self-explanatory grayscale key

153
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,659
rotate is another fun one that I can

154
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:06,190
highlight so this you can play with so

155
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,050
here's like zero degrees and then I

156
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,570
could do like 180 degrees rotates the

157
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,820
hue of that color just on a circular

158
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,940
plane by the degree that you basically

159
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,330
set it to here so you can solve a lot of

160
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,250
really small problems by using filters

161
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,229
very briefly this is a blog post that I

162
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,710
wrote and I use the paper app so I use

163
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,210
the paper app and what happens in use

164
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,919
the paper app is you get this grey

165
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,930
background but I wanted to flow into

166
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,310
this white background a little bit on my

167
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,949
page so I just set this WebKit filter

168
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:37,810
and as you can see all the images here

169
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,169
do have that gray

170
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,909
but instead of opening all these images

171
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,199
in Photoshop editing them all

172
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,300
individually I just had to add a WebKit

173
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,800
filter or just a regular filter of

174
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,080
brightness 1.1 I could have used a

175
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,539
contrast filter and it just makes it

176
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,180
flow a lot better into this document one

177
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,580
line of code beautiful thank you CSS

178
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,779
filters you can also have some fun with

179
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:01,610
it because this CSS you can do fun

180
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,560
things like animate this is literally

181
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,629
five lines of code I'm using a hue

182
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,819
rotate animation and it's creating this

183
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:10,279
visualization just super quick super

184
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,810
easy and something that's inherent to us

185
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,949
so blend modes this is where things

186
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,770
start to get really interesting so there

187
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,689
are two types background blend mode and

188
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,819
mix blend mode and background blend mode

189
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,580
works on the background items within the

190
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,020
element so if an element has multiple

191
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,999
backgrounds you can use this to kind of

192
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,830
channel how those different backgrounds

193
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,990
interact with each other so the support

194
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,249
on this is a little worse than filters

195
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,139
em edge again doesn't really have much

196
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,960
but it's getting there so mixed blend

197
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,729
mode is very similar with sports and

198
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:43,219
this takes that element itself and talks

199
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,569
about how it's going to blend in with

200
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,899
the other elements on the page behind it

201
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,580
so all the blend mode options that we

202
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,379
have in Photoshop are listed here

203
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,189
and CSS has a majority of these so I'm

204
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:56,990
going to kind of walk through how those

205
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,990
work a little bit so the blend mode

206
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,460
types there are five different types

207
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,889
there's the darken modes group there are

208
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,099
light modes contrast modes Comparative

209
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:10,159
modes and composite modes so I'm going

210
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,110
to use my balloon friend here to help me

211
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,899
explain this Munsell color system with

212
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,649
web color names here so as you can see

213
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,689
there is a rainbow projected on this

214
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,370
balloon and if you look at these lights

215
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,839
from the top of the stage it's the

216
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,819
lightness value that's the luminosity so

217
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,680
stranding it down the light and it kind

218
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,120
of becomes a cone of darkness at the

219
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,249
bottom now you can see the whole range

220
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:32,779
of colors surrounding the balloon and

221
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,729
the very inside of the balloon that

222
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,849
Center Point's is a 50% gray so no

223
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,589
matter what the line light can't shine

224
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:42,079
in all the way it becomes a 50% gray you

225
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:43,430
still have light from the top coming

226
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,800
down so the most saturated value is what

227
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,149
this balloon gets from that light

228
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:50,029
projecting immediately thank you to the

229
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,800
awesome light team here I also give them

230
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,970
around

231
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,240
let's keep that up there because they'll

232
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,890
help explain the blend modes when I keep

233
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,740
going but I figured I might as well take

234
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,270
a bloon off the loan use it while I have

235
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,820
the opportunity so to explain dark and

236
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,350
blend modes I'm going to use the help of

237
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,250
vanilla ice and vanilla ice cream so

238
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,440
let's start with multiply ok we're

239
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,610
multiplying them are going to overlap

240
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,710
our images so the way that multiplied

241
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,450
works is it uses the luminance levels

242
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,240
that light level of the pixels in each

243
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,340
space of these two images and it just

244
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,800
multiplies the pixels um math terms it

245
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,750
just does a times B and this is a lot

246
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,640
like transparency so if you take Juve

247
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,230
entrace perón seized and overlay them

248
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,060
and then shine a light through that's

249
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,280
what the multiply blend mode does so if

250
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,560
your pixel value is 1 if luminosity is 1

251
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,270
it shines all the way through but the

252
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,490
more you layer the darker it gets so

253
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,920
darken works in a similar way except it

254
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,680
uses the RGB values so if not as dark

255
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,360
because it's using the color range on a

256
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,270
per color a per channel basis to sort of

257
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,280
detect which colors should remain which

258
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,710
which leaves so if the active layer

259
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,510
pixels the active layer is the ice cream

260
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,430
here I'm only applying the blend mode to

261
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,560
that active layer if those pixels are

262
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,480
darker than they stay but if they're

263
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,400
lighter than the tones of pixels behind

264
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,130
them they're replaced by those tones the

265
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,380
last one is color burn which is the most

266
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,810
saturated of all of these and it also

267
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,640
uses the luminance values but it uses an

268
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,310
inversion algorithm to sort of have that

269
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,040
more saturated look so for lighten blend

270
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,890
modes we're gonna have a dog surfing and

271
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,050
a dog skateboarding who's the winner

272
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,130
here so screen blend mode is the

273
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,650
opposite of the multiply blend mode it

274
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,720
is inverting the pixel so how like I

275
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,310
mentioned earlier it's doing 1 minus

276
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,380
that luminosity value and then it's

277
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,090
multiplying that for both the active and

278
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,740
background layer and then inverting the

279
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,600
product of that so it's inverting it

280
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,640
again and this basically means that

281
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,700
we're multiplying the light pixels so

282
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,430
then lighten is using those RGB values

283
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,800
it's not as bright as screen and color

284
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,720
Dodge is the brightest so blows things

285
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,950
out the quickest of all of these

286
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,280
lightening blend modes now once we have

287
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,500
the contrast group so here we're gonna

288
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,060
do oatmeal and a comic from the oatmeal

289
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,570
I really worked hard in these puns yell

290
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,490
alright so we're gonna do overlay so one

291
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,560
thing that the contrast group is a uses

292
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,760
a combination of lighten and darken

293
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,350
modes in different ways

294
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,150
and so for over like for example

295
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,970
specifically it uses both the screen and

296
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,910
the multiply blend mode both in half

297
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,220
strength and it takes those mid-tones

298
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,380
50% gray and just drops them so that's

299
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,250
how that works

300
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,900
soft play is a little more organic it

301
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,600
keeps those 50% mid-tones and then hard

302
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,080
light is the most dramatic so they all

303
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,700
sort of work in similar ways with the

304
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
contrast group comparative blend modes

305
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,670
are next and so we have an oreo rainbows

306
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,590
this is my favorite group and then Tim

307
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,820
Tams for all the Australians here it's a

308
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,560
Tim Tam fridge I wanted to bridge the

309
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,920
gap because I want Tim Tams in America

310
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,660
anyway let's make that happen with

311
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,050
difference oh my gosh so this group does

312
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,290
something pretty fun so it basically

313
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,620
takes pixels that are on the same space

314
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,440
of the two values and it inverts the

315
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,060
pixels based on the luminance channels

316
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,830
on a channel by channel basis so you

317
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,720
take the active layer pixel and you

318
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,670
subtract it from the same layer on the

319
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,650
background pixel and for difference is

320
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,200
selective inversion where similar colors

321
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,330
will turn black they'll cancel each

322
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,890
other out and turn black but it inverts

323
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,650
it so the original point and use case of

324
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,660
difference was lining up transparencies

325
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,580
when you had the perfect black on black

326
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,810
that's how you knew that things were

327
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,810
perfectly aligned exclusion is pretty

328
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,490
similar to difference but it has those

329
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,680
50% gray mid-tones so it's a little bit

330
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,080
lighter than the difference blend mode

331
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,750
and then we have one last group and

332
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,610
that's the composite one mode that's why

333
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,890
I'm glad that my friends Klaus here is

334
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,440
helping so we've got the Wi-Fi password

335
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,930
pretty much so we got cat pictures as

336
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,430
promised and pupae laces um so this is

337
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,230
kind of interesting what happens here is

338
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,810
with the active layer so the lasers it

339
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,480
only takes a hue it keeps that hue color

340
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,070
that's mixing it with both the

341
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,440
luminosity and the saturation of the

342
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,540
background layer so since the cats are

343
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,910
so bright it keeps that bright white so

344
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,050
I'm taking the hue and since they're not

345
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,690
very saturated

346
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,670
you shade is going to become lighter I'm

347
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,340
over top of the cats in this demo

348
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,400
example so saturation only takes a

349
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,860
saturation of lasers so it takes the

350
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,110
colors of the cat so their eyes become a

351
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,270
very bright blue their fur becomes very

352
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,790
very saturated but the value the color

353
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,270
value remains and so does the luminosity

354
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,260
so luminosity is going to look a little

355
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,720
different than all of these this one is

356
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,620
taking just luminosity so the basically

357
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,870
the blacks and whites of laser image and

358
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,820
imposing the cat's coloring on top of

359
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,190
that the hue and then my favorite of all

360
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,980
these is the color blend mode so this is

361
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,810
really cool because it uses both the hue

362
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,600
and saturation of the active layer so of

363
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,910
those lasers and slurring it on top of

364
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,370
just luminosity of the cats so in

365
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,810
essence it's like taking a

366
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,070
black-and-white photograph and

367
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,770
overlaying that with a color image but

368
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,660
the best part is the photograph doesn't

369
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,400
have to be black and white because the

370
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,570
browser is doing that for us

371
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,390
it's making it happen so anything you

372
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,880
can just use to color on top of an image

373
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,450
with the mixed blend mode of color so

374
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,740
you can do a lot of really fun

375
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,270
techniques if we look at that example

376
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,760
again of the header that I made for that

377
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,100
blog post something that we can do is

378
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,030
add like a mix blend mode of multiply

379
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,000
and it starts to really blend that

380
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,070
background this could be any color this

381
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,430
could be like a that's a blue color okay

382
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,230
that's cool we'll keep it at say a

383
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,170
purple um so we can make it multiply but

384
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,970
remember how it wasn't exactly white we

385
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,760
still had to do a WebKit filter to

386
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,830
increase the brightness or the contrast

387
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,810
let's do the contrast like one point one

388
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,120
and there it's flowing perfectly in with

389
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,040
the background we can do a hero Tate

390
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,470
some of those shapes might start to

391
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,940
change color we can really start to

392
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,060
dynamically play around with this just

393
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,680
like in the browser is probably more

394
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,390
like 130 degrees like that changes

395
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,770
another option is we can do a screen

396
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,660
blend mode which is the opposite of

397
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,610
multiply like we went over and then we

398
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,980
would have to go in and invert that so

399
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,930
you can really start to play around with

400
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,300
things just dynamically in your browser

401
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,950
and you can be super lazy about it

402
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,780
in fact I call the filet Z designer

403
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,860
method

404
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,020
so there are two parts to this the first

405
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,790
one is you use the blend mode of

406
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,640
multiply or screen and then you isolate

407
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,530
the graphic with contrast filters and

408
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,950
possibly the physical shape of it so as

409
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,600
an example here's a picture I took them

410
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,770
belong here from the rooftop of the

411
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,600
hotel last week super cool and I just

412
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,340
have a little hello waving back and

413
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,260
forth but if we really dissect this

414
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,430
you'll see what's going on in the

415
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,990
background so let's make a little bit

416
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,910
bigger because I cut down the size five

417
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,590
minutes to bake so 300 by maybe the

418
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,480
height of 400 and then you start to

419
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,240
think like what is that it's not fun

420
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,490
little hello that I thought it was let's

421
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,290
get rid of that multiply blend mode okay

422
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,010
let's get rid of the WebKit filter we

423
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,020
can give her the positioning so if you

424
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,610
take a look it's me holding up a random

425
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,470
coaster at a bar that I took a picture

426
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,570
of and I overlaid it on top of a graphic

427
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,400
and you can't tell it all with that lazy

428
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,990
designer Messick's and using blend modes

429
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,750
and filters it's pretty cool another

430
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:31,120
example of this thank you

431
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,940
being lazy here's another example of

432
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,680
this but I use the screen blend mode so

433
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,510
I took this random little sketch I could

434
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,450
just reload the browser thing um and

435
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,070
here's me I'm doing that it's a sketch

436
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,250
for my sketchbook I am using these same

437
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,990
technique but with screen and just comes

438
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,880
in elements in the page and allows for a

439
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,960
really nice flow awesome websites that

440
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,820
use blend modes for instance front and

441
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,290
London they have this really nice

442
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,050
gradient of hot pink to red on this page

443
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,790
and you can even use it for um

444
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,350
performance optimization because you can

445
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,940
use just a grayscale image that

446
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,800
background for the JPEG decrease the

447
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,270
color size decrease the image size and

448
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,510
use blend modes to like make this

449
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,610
dynamic and really interesting

450
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,830
composition regardless of the images

451
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,550
that you have in there

452
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,520
another example is polygons they have a

453
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,830
really unique look on their homepage for

454
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,450
this news story it's not something that

455
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,310
you see often these days but it's really

456
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,860
nice aesthetic to see and then the xoxo

457
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,870
conference uses blend modes and my

458
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,760
favorite part blend modes is you can

459
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,620
scroll around you can animate them you

460
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,270
can really make this dynamic and

461
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,800
exciting for your user it's such a

462
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,200
little thing that allows for a much more

463
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,690
unique aesthetic let's go back in time

464
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,090
for a little bit back to the days of

465
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,920
deviantART does anyone here do

466
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,560
deviantART yeah awesome so back in the

467
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,210
day I remember I would go on and I would

468
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,230
look for Photoshop actions and here was

469
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,970
like this description I don't don't read

470
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,530
that it's way too much text please don't

471
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,480
read it so anyway I wanted to start week

472
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,000
Rainey's Photoshop actions so um I found

473
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,530
one that sounded interesting

474
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,840
raging mists offers the most faded

475
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,490
outlook of all of these it fades out

476
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,530
images with purple hues and warmer tones

477
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,530
to create a sultry vintage effect sound

478
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,160
sultry let's do it all right so let's

479
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,930
recreate raging this filter that's the

480
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,370
raging mist filter and that's our

481
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,620
original image so let's start the first

482
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,030
thing that we can do is use some filters

483
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,850
so WebKit filter like I'm using a sepia

484
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,860
because I see some more warm tones I'm

485
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,330
going to do a hue rotate to start

486
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,040
getting it there maybe increase the

487
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,200
saturation okay so that's great that's

488
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,330
on the image itself that's step one step

489
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,370
two is adding a layer on top so I'm

490
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,330
going to show you the have a layer on

491
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,230
top of here with a background color

492
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,670
I'll start with red so you could see it

493
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,800
okay so I didn't lie there's something

494
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,160
up there

495
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,680
and so now I want to do a mix blend mode

496
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,460
of maybe like multiply so it's laying on

497
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,710
top of that image but that's not exactly

498
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,710
the color that we want as a know so what

499
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,660
you can do is open your dev tools and

500
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,880
use it like a browser pretty much like

501
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,860
Photoshop you can use a really nice

502
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,840
color selector here you can change the

503
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,570
the Alpha Channel and you can even

504
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,930
select from the page to start getting

505
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,490
that aesthetic that we want like I can

506
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,840
just keep clicking around maybe if I

507
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,850
don't like that color I could edit it a

508
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,920
little bit but it's starting to really

509
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,110
look like the image that we want to get

510
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,660
for the final so that's good and there's

511
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,910
only one step left if we really look at

512
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,610
this raging mist example here I have to

513
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,130
remove it more you'll notice that in the

514
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,110
darkest parts we're losing some detail

515
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,850
in the shadow there's sort of this wash

516
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,980
over it it's like a washout effect it's

517
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,480
like this vintage it's a little bit

518
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,110
purpley gray effect there so let's make

519
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,970
that happen this is what I like to call

520
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,190
the washout effect method got some nice

521
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,350
methods for you the first step is to use

522
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,270
the blend mode of lighten and after

523
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,440
we've done that we want to use a

524
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,420
background color of the shadow colors

525
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,760
the darkest color that we want to appear

526
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,670
on our image so here's an example of

527
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,530
doing that so to set the background mode

528
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,920
to lighten and then I am choosing this

529
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,470
secondary background so those are just

530
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,780
two backgrounds comma separated values

531
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,550
and as I go lighter the background

532
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,470
becomes lighter and then I can choose

533
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,080
that darkest color that I want to appear

534
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,060
on the page every other color will get

535
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,220
washed out so let's do that so all right

536
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,050
I have my first background here let's

537
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,490
make other backgrounds of red for

538
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,590
instance and like I said we're going to

539
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,670
do a background blood mode of lighten

540
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,070
okay so that's not exactly the shade

541
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,270
that we want it's washing out a little

542
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,430
too much so again I'm going to inspect

543
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,140
element I'm going to find this image

544
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,440
find that red and sort of just set it to

545
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,520
like a deeper hue maybe like a purpley

546
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,620
washout tone I think that looks pretty

547
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,810
close so I'm going to keep that I have

548
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,210
this value here and yeah that looks

549
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,390
pretty good

550
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:04,940
for the region that's filtered

551
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,650
not bad it could be worse but it could

552
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,720
be better so let's kick it up a notch

553
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,530
the CSS gradients okay so I'm going to

554
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,030
go through this really quickly based

555
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,680
gradients you just can do a linear

556
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,870
gradient set to colors it starts at the

557
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,390
50% mark so I'm using this pink color

558
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,120
see 69 which is the sass color so I like

559
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,000
to use that for everything and then the

560
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,710
second goal area is like this blue shade

561
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,420
so it's basic gradient you can change

562
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,190
the directions I could do two right I

563
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,680
could do like two left to top to bottom

564
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,810
whatever I can change those directions I

565
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,640
can do degrees so here I've negative

566
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,230
twenty degrees I could do like 120

567
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,350
degrees it changes the direction of that

568
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,270
gradients you can also open the dev

569
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,160
tools here and watch it spin which is

570
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,270
really fun because you can just hit

571
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,250
shift and arrow key and it'll like spin

572
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,830
for you so that's something that I have

573
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,300
no life alright so the next thing that I

574
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,440
want talk about is the gradient stops

575
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,990
these are fun a cool thing is like the

576
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,960
further you go towards these stops you

577
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,580
can actually make like stripes so if I

578
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,100
keep going I set these both to 30 like

579
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,750
that makes a solid line because it's

580
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,850
fewer and fewer pixels for a gradient to

581
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,310
occur on and then what you can do is you

582
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,110
can make like repeating gradients so you

583
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,430
could make stripes across your page

584
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,110
these are really fun for backgrounds and

585
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,230
other such things we have the radial

586
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,110
gradients so this takes the shape of the

587
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,270
element that it's contained within but

588
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,030
you can also set the shape of that

589
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,640
radial so I can make it a circle I can

590
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,100
say like I want it to be like a 200 by

591
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,760
30 pixel weird shape and you have a lot

592
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,830
of control with this as well and there's

593
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,690
also stripes the good news I could do a

594
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,430
repeating radial gradient so if I wanted

595
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,140
those solid stripes what I could do is

596
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,720
set like the start color so start C 69

597
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm going to end let's make this pixel

598
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,500
so it's easier to see ten pixels the

599
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,510
next color starting at ten pixels and

600
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,090
then I'm going to have it ending at that

601
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,700
same color maybe I want this 30 pixels

602
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,730
wide so now I have this crazy gradients

603
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,820
to circle so it's not so crazy but yeah

604
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,230
you could just do radial stripes and

605
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,920
play around CSS is so much fun I'm so

606
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,240
sorry

607
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,660
so sorry so conic gradients are really

608
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,250
cool I think Lea's go talking about them

609
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,320
later go check that out or just stay in

610
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,030
this room listen to our talk I cannot

611
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,550
wait to watch this so that's the thing

612
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,590
to look forward to later all right

613
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,990
so this is an example of just using

614
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,700
those blend modes with the gradient so

615
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,340
here just basic image here is the just

616
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,720
the gradient I'm applying to it and it

617
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,330
creates all of these image variations

618
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,300
I'm just so many different aesthetics by

619
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,650
playing around and they all look pretty

620
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,180
good I could have probably chosen any of

621
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:54,240
these but wait there's more double fam

622
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,440
all right I'm going to take you back in

623
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,590
the day again to the days of these um

624
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,240
free blurry backgrounds so blurry

625
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,310
backgrounds are really cool right we all

626
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,130
kind of use them we can break that down

627
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,840
and make them ourselves

628
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,610
you know why open Photoshop and make one

629
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,290
when we can make these with gradients so

630
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,060
you can break it down and look at that

631
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,490
one it has this magenta to royal blue

632
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,470
color there's like this purple spot the

633
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,390
bottom there's a sweet spot the top

634
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,600
maybe some angled gradients of this like

635
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,370
tomato and light blue color this is why

636
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,870
I'm really good a named CSS colors I

637
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,340
don't know it's not a good thing fine

638
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,070
okay so let's zoom in and make this

639
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,810
thing happen all right so there's the

640
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,940
final product that we're going for

641
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,900
here's our background what's going to

642
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,120
happen I think a good place to start is

643
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,110
with this linear gradient that goes from

644
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:45,760
like a hot pink to blue okay so there's

645
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,350
that but we don't want to go from top to

646
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,030
bottom we want to go to right so let's

647
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,280
make it go to right maybe this is more

648
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,410
like a deep pink I don't like I said I

649
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,310
don't know why I know all these color

650
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,980
names it's fine okay so that's a good

651
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,750
place to start I think the next best

652
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,150
thing is to make that light spot the top

653
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,190
so it's like this creamy color so we'll

654
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,090
do a radial gradient at the top and

655
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,020
it'll be from like wheat to transparent

656
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,890
we want a comma okay so that's that's

657
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,750
cool and we want to be at top so I can

658
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,250
say where I want you positioned at and

659
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,050
maybe I want this to be a circle at the

660
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,120
top or maybe I want to specify the shape

661
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,490
of it I think the circle is okay for now

662
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,140
and I wanted to be a little bit offset

663
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,640
in the page so I could be like negative

664
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,710
10% is the start of that and I

665
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,289
want to end at like 80% okay so we're

666
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:34,809
starting to sort of get there okay so

667
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:37,590
next maybe beneath that we have this

668
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,210
this tomato color so we have a linear

669
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,309
gradient and I know that it's going to

670
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,679
be at a degree so maybe like 160 degrees

671
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,659
and it could be tomato it's going to be

672
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:49,179
transparent I'm going to add a comma all

673
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:51,100
right so that's starting to look more

674
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,020
like what we have but to save you all

675
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,390
this pressure watching me go through all

676
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:06,210
of it I've already done it look at that

677
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,769
so what's really exciting about this is

678
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,659
it's super powerful for creating your

679
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:12,669
own customized filters you can create

680
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:15,039
anything when you use this technique and

681
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,259
I use it on this site I used a very

682
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:18,820
similar one to the one I just showed you

683
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,620
and it adds this really unified

684
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,809
aesthetic to this page so without them

685
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,820
these images are kind of boring and they

686
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,080
blend into the background doesn't look

687
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,750
that good but if I add a custom filter

688
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,789
that I make out of these gradients it

689
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,769
really brings them together and unifies

690
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:36,190
them on the page so you can make

691
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,110
Instagram filters very very quickly and

692
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,019
easily pretty pretty easily so here's a

693
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:42,340
picture of the office area of my

694
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,980
apartment and I use this an example so

695
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,340
like rays Aiden I just did these for fun

696
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,110
Inc well the cool thing about that is I

697
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,909
don't even have to use another after

698
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,100
element to add some kind of blend mode I

699
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,750
just used WebKit filters for that one

700
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,179
and then for Perpetua I didn't use any

701
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:00,519
WebKit filters I just used a blend mode

702
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,389
afterwards

703
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:03,519
it's like this blue to gray blue degree

704
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,210
and sort of fake so let's review because

705
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,450
we're at the end here CSS filters plus

706
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,899
CSS blend modes plus CSS gradients equal

707
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:18,279
awesome and in conclusion CSS is awesome

708
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:20,139
like you can't do this in Photoshop you

709
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,000
can't have this hero chain animation in

710
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,370
a presentation and Photoshop very easily

711
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,490
I don't think don't tell me I'm wrong

712
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,379
but this is just the beginning like this

713
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,429
is really exciting like this Barbie

714
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:31,720
alright now we're at this very basic

715
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,970
Mario game but soon we're going to be at

716
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,470
like Super Mario 3d World

717
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,779
you know when browser start to really

718
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:39,100
implement these and make them work

719
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,370
really well with our GPUs it's really

720
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,080
good to just start playing around now so

721
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,059
I say art the web if you make something

722
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,500
cool this talk inspired you use the

723
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,240

724
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,850
things in your own personal projects or

725
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,740
in production I sort of played around

726
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,929
with it on this site that I made I do a

727
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:58,210
little bit of traveling and I write

728
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,360
about it sometimes I call it bad poetry

729
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,909
of good memories and if you want to go

730
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:06,129

731
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:07,720
some of the concepts I talked about in

732
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,370
this talk so I'm using some different

733
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,639
things like she sees shapes and I'm

00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:14,259
using some of the filters and blend

735
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,960
modes looks way better on your browser

736
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,269
