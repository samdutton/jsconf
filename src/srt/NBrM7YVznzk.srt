00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,369

I am general machen on today I will

2
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,580
speak to you about a muttered rarity I'm

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,730
passionate about it on especially web of

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,689
muttered rarity so what is web augmented

5
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,560
reality versus augmented reality

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,160
pictures better than words so here below

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,540
you have blood rather and you have a

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,960
wonderful ear Oh looking at a very big

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,030
Allah Graham he has no device on the

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,700
head nor device on your hand everything

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,610
is working well well that's cool but

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,899
that's Hollywood unfortunately so this

13
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,350
is what augmented reality could be we

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,530
would like it to be like that for

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,870
Hollywood that's specially fight for the

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,489
real world and that's a good definition

17
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,270
of augmented reality you would mount

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,909
reality by adding information on top of

19
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,299
it so let's see what clock w was to

20
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,350
serve address this is a possible

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,320
application of what augmented reality

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,290
could be or would be in the future

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,110
so check review suppose you are in a

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,020
shop and you see a lot of product on the

25
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,200
shelf you take your phone you point your

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,299
phone at the product and suddenly you

27
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,520
see the world view from your friend so

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,210
review from other people wet on the

29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,840
internet suddenly you make a more

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,909
knowledgeable choice about to purchase

31
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,950
or better use of your money another well

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,490
suppose you want to wash some clothes

33
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,570
and you have a tag on your clothes most

34
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,640
of the time it is quite cryptic and you

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,429
do not understand it will be great if I

36
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,180
can point my phone axis tag and suddenly

37
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,920
it is explained to me

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,670
in plain words once again I avoid a

39
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,020
lower rate so this is nice this is a

40
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,390
dream this is what reality will be in

41
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,209
the future but let's see about what it

42
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,760
is today and today for at least for me

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,220
augmented reality can be run in ten line

44
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,870
of HTML so this is quite important first

45
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,610
because this is tan line on Sudan

46
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,739
because this is a sh t ml let me explain

47
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:44,310
why

48
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,239
so this is what you see on the screen is

49
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,290
a basic example of a rjs so you have

50
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,880
only ten line of HTML

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,890
this is a basic script here body any web

52
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,790
def can do it and if you do this

53
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,799
wonderful example you will have this

54
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,230
result so a basic cube on top of a

55
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,319
marker this is a very basic example

56
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,870
because this is only tan line but you

57
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,030
can build significant application in the

58
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,519
very little line this is a point here

59
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,350
let me come back to this one this is

60
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,180
important because this is tan line

61
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,810
so tonight is short so you can learn on

62
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,829
Ted page that somewhere and this is our

63
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,890
channel so it mean anybody on the planet

64
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,400
anybody who is a web developer can do

65
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,000
this this is short and simple to

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,579
understand on any web developer can do

67
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,600
it this is definitely point here you can

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,590
see Aleksandra my wife doing that inside

69
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,500
cut pen so you take this basic example

70
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,160
you place that into Capel and certainly

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,420
you can do a mozzarella t on the left of

72
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,430
materiality is easy where they are

73
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,040
chairs at least I try to make it easy

74
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,500
let me show you this videos that we used

75
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,760
you know in order to have Wi-Fi know we

76
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,120
have Wi-Fi so here you have a marker

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,660
we've no freaking table

78
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,380
and if you look at your marker

79
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,320
sousaphone drugs augmented reality you

80
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,710
can move around this is 60 FPS so it's

81
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,030
working on on old phones very important

82
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,750
full open source and based on web

83
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,850
standout we will see all the advantage

84
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,860
of a spatula in to talk on dot forget a

85
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,680
phone without much energy it's fun

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:04,600
enough okay let me try to okay so when I

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,170
did they are Jess what was in my head is

88
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,090
some other things first I wanted to

89
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,730
realize my dream about a hour meaning

90
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,330
that for the controversial reason I had

91
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,510
a lot of free time and I wanted to build

92
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,390
a are as it should be where they are so

93
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,060
it should be so I use on drug part of my

94
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,050
free time to do that and but in my head

95
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,260
when I did that it was a lot like being

96
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,950
a drug let me explain why when I did

97
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,930
this project just I forgot to say it's

98
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,530
open source so I had to look compose on

99
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,610
unruffled on the surface but below

100
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,670
I had to paddle like hell because this

101
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,240
was an open source project so I did that

102
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,770
with my two hand and under the hood I

103
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,620
had a lot of responsibilities I had to

104
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,310
do fixing bad I had to do testing to

105
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,180
improve the accuracy of the camera

106
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,140
tracking so augmented reality accuracy

107
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,390
all of this software engineering stuff

108
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,220
this was longer than grateful as be

109
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,050
honest but it was needed so I did it but

110
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,890
yes

111
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,590
so I was alone to hand out doing all the

112
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,200
design or jaw structure also called

113
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,110
working ten hours a day not making a

114
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,580
penny because I happened to be

115
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,260
unemployed

116
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,150
but good for the free time health center

117
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,290
point but for me LGS was realized my

118
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,700
dream to make a are as easy as possible

119
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,200
because I believe it has to be easy so

120
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,600
let's look deeper on what is our chairs

121
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,040
first mission the mission of AES is to

122
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,770
bring air to the web or to make where

123
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:10,110
they are a reality so for that I wanted

124
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,970
to make energy as very fast web-based

125
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,020
open-source and realizing and

126
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,420
stalled-out force as a principle and try

127
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,820
to apply so first very fast while it has

128
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,250
to be very fast is because when you do

129
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,160
augmented reality basically you need to

130
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,090
work that at 60fps or close if you do

131
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,960
that at 5 PS this is boring and this is

132
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,580
not moving well so you are not in mass

133
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,570
if you already know that a trick if you

134
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,940
are 60 FPS this is a lot better for

135
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,080
ability so when I took it it was 5 PS on

136
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,320
an eye on phone on right now this is 60

137
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,320
FPS even on a two-year-old phone

138
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,490
additionally LGS is web-based what does

139
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,250
this mean this mean this is full

140
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,740
JavaScript and this is a pure web

141
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,890
solution it has plan consequences when

142
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,810
you are on the phone when you are on the

143
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,100
phone you don't want to install

144
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,900
application this is not something you

145
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,080
like all statistics shows that to

146
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,380
install application is really some

147
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,210
things that people don't want to do on

148
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,880
the more it goes with time so let's

149
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,990
install applications so to be pure pure

150
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,380
web is very nice additionally it is

151
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,979
relying on standard this means that any

152
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,349
web browser can with WebGL on WebRTC can

153
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,360
do way out yes there is no need so

154
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,230
specifically a public API sorry or

155
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,360
specific application

156
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,290
modern web browser is enough this means

157
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,779
that a RGS work on Android Windows Phone

158
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:01,309
on iOS so basically every phone of the

159
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:05,480
planet it's good now you know how it all

160
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,579
started

161
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,199
but what happened after the beginning of

162
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:10,600
our chairs

163
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,799
well 2017 has been a big year for motor

164
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,399
reality and at the middle of the year in

165
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,980
June 2017

166
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,999
Apple announced a our kit so what is the

167
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:26,720
accurate

168
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,600
this is markerless tracking mikelis

169
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,369
tracking means that you can take your

170
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:33,259
phone you don't need to print a marker

171
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:36,110
to look at your marker you switch on

172
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,839
your phone and you can have a granted

173
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,369
relative right there and to middle of

174
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:44,179
the street I our kit as well as

175
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:46,819
something we call it testing so it

176
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,569
testing is the phone is able to

177
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,639
understand the topology of the world

178
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,399
meaning is able to detect the plane on

179
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,980
the ground is about to detect a table

180
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,160
and you can put augmented reality on the

181
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,429
table on the ground whatever

182
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:06,769
another interesting aspect is racket

183
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:09,649
will be will be is available on

184
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,410
monocular camera we will see more about

185
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:18,529
what is a monocular camera man so racket

186
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,839
when it has been announced it was really

187
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,610
really really big it for augmented

188
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,079
reality it was a bump in the world why

189
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,410
because of materiality was by default on

190
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,649
the phone in your pocket before a

191
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,220
hatchet to havoc materiality you needed

192
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,529
to have a specific devices Pacific

193
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:44,419
device on you had a specific form but we

194
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,199
they are cheap

195
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:48,470
you got ignited reality by default there

196
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,739
is no need for anything else so yeah it

197
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:55,069
was a very first step for massive user

198
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:58,879
adoption all that faith to the monocular

199
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,809
camera support everybody was rightfully

200
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:03,829
in prayer

201
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:09,769
and in August 2017 Google replied with

202
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:15,339
air crawl so two months after that and

203
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:20,089
in for all normal purposes they are

204
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:22,309
co-owner a kid are very very similar

205
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:25,670
from a factual point of view but it was

206
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,389
very good from augmented reality echo

207
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:34,639
system because before Apple was under

208
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,569
multiple and suddenly said you don't

209
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:41,589
have it anymore we are Google and Apple

210
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,089
kelabra collaborating competing with

211
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:46,930
each other it's very important

212
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,629
Google is with Android 88% of the world

213
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:55,459
one market an iPhone is 12% but both of

214
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,309
them competing with each other is good

215
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:00,829
for see a consistent diversity and

216
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:03,319
competition is healthy for the users Co

217
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:05,860
system as well

218
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,209
another advantage with this announcement

219
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,819
of air crore is Google exposing

220
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,850
augmented reality to the web we are all

221
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,370
on our kid native API is not something

222
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,879
that you can easily reach from the web

223
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,649
because Google is so very keen at the

224
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:27,939
web they build to application in which

225
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:33,550
they expose Eric watch it to web browser

226
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,209
most application suite name of where

227
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,579
they are on air core and where they are

228
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:43,040
on achieved will can feel that an

229
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,809
engineer kind of world so what are those

230
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,660
application where they are near crow is

231
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,750
a chromium modified to read air crawl on

232
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,179
exposure to two column where they are on

233
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:03,170
arch it is reading air jet unless it is

234
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,589
expressing that to an iOS web view what

235
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,199
is interesting from the web a our point

236
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:13,220
of view is they expose air co-ownership

237
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,370
with the exact same api so when you

238
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:16,819
build you

239
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:20,179
a application on the web you need to

240
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,939
build it only once and it will work on

241
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:25,699
those two application on a across on iOS

242
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:30,999
or on a aqua on-air kid

243
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,979
let's look at some example so this is a

244
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,959
typical application that you can build

245
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:45,019
that in whatever I have a bunch of video

246
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,369
so I hope we can have Wi-Fi apparently

247
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:49,819
not

248
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:54,139
come on be nice with me this is not nice

249
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:58,279
with me so this is a wonderful

250
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,100
application in which you can fetch you

251
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,479
can throw a stick on you god I'm trying

252
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:09,609
again come on

253
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:12,470
that would be a very sad talk if I don't

254
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,759
have okay

255
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,809
partly YouTube doesn't go through

256
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:22,869
anymore so let me comment on the picture

257
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:27,350
so what is a keypad so basically you are

258
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:33,799
a very cute dog and you throw a virtual

259
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,799
stick to this virtual pet on the go

260
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,439
fetch and come back the video is very

261
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:43,429
cute on am evilly sad very sad

262
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:48,279
okay alright we're gonna try this ammo

263
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,350
here it's another video let's try this

264
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,889
one

265
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,009
oh this one is working I don't get it

266
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:58,819
ugly cool let's be appear bad so this

267
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,279
one is a portal so here's the iron

268
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,669
Englund and they see that materiality

269
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:07,279
door meaning that your portal to another

270
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,379
reality I foolish you see San Francisco

271
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,289
and you see Sir Francis course was a

272
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,739
portal but you can a well walk through

273
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:22,339
this wonderful portal and you piggy you

274
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,319
I in San Francisco the bird is really

275
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,730
too and San Francisco you can route

276
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,589
around and be in San Francisco you can

277
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:35,269
recognize a bridge and see the portal on

278
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,190
your back in England

279
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:43,100
it's a fastest way to travel okay let's

280
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:49,579
be up full on the video staff this other

281
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:54,399
video is a teresting for the realism

282
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,149
always grown flying around look quite

283
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:02,440
immersive I mean you don't see them as I

284
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,699
don't know talking too much 3d because

285
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,149
this really is used something called PBR

286
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:13,459
which make it very realistic when you

287
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:15,380
look matted relative justly it's very

288
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,329
important to be as well stick as

289
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:19,220
possible this way you are a lot more

290
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:25,250
immersive the arrows are air heat

291
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,579
apparently this was only occur but

292
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:30,740
almost demo can be done on air crawl and

293
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:36,459
air kit so after a occur on an arcade

294
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:40,250
what should we do with a RGS well we

295
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,149
made a RGS evolve since we parted that

296
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:47,899
to a frame API we parted that as well to

297
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:50,269
Babylon so you can use a GS with three

298
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:53,690
GS a frame and Babylon J's its report a

299
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,470
our kit on our craw - so this is quite

300
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,519
good because let me explain so my

301
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,610
kitchen not sure about that

302
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,000
what is interesting is when you do an

303
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,929
application with a RGS you can support

304
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,449
every tracking possible we have your

305
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,179
LG's application when you are on air

306
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,970
core device LGS will use air core

307
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,419
tracking if you are on an iOS device it

308
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,360
will use our keep tracking and if you

309
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,120
are on a normal phone which is not

310
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,760
supporting our on air kit it will use

311
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,350
pure web tracking

312
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,070
so now chess will provide the best

313
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,230
tracking available on your device no

314
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,020
matter what device you have

315
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,420
which is nice about this is when you

316
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,030
build your application you don't need to

317
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,650
build one application for their CRO

318
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,250
another for your kit and another for

319
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,080
Joseph phones you have a single

320
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,000
application which report of the

321
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,100
available tracking you write your

322
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,470
application once or it will run on every

323
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:10,910
platform here is another example YouTube

324
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,440
Twitter is working but youtube is

325
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,920
failing

326
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,030
what okay this one is working through so

327
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,840
this is in my apartment and when you do

328
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,940
a mounted reality it is let's say a

329
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,060
tradition to do a tsunami KU I'm not

330
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,810
sure why

331
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,570
so this one is actually Miku dancing in

332
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,090
my apartment it has been done on trongo

333
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,150
device and you can see you can be close

334
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,670
you can hear a thing you can see my cut

335
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:47,700
this one is real and I have to cut

336
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,120
search if you want to love more this is

337
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,790
my first video of with affair GS with a

338
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,890
our crow

339
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,190
yes not very impressive but as it is my

340
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,230
first demo so it's basically the cube

341
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:10,360
floating in the air inside my apartment

342
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:16,410
so what can you do with energy s one

343
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,500
thing that I like to do is refraction

344
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,300
because when you talk mantle reality one

345
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,880
things you really need to do is to match

346
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,750
the virtual on the real meanings that

347
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,720
you want anything that you add to the

348
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,640
real world to appear as real as possible

349
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,890
so one aspect that I did is refraction

350
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,650
we okay cool so refraction is not

351
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,210
arresting because here you have

352
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,490
obviously big tourists please Victoria

353
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,730
sees obviously not real but I did it

354
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,250
it's such a juicy spool it appears a

355
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:53,950
glass

356
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,820
so you see fools are 3d this way this

357
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,490
really seems a lot more included into

358
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,390
the real so you see and after that you

359
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,960
can see my wife at the end so you see

360
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,160
through and you can see the 3d and

361
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,810
suddenly it's become a lot more real yes

362
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:21,070
Erica that's yet it is rather simple to

363
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:26,980
do this one is when you do augmented

364
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,320
reality you like to do something magical

365
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,530
as well here this is a background my

366
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,730
table but I use some 3d tricks to make

367
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,290
it appears as inside the whole that's an

368
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,320
effect called hole in the wall so you

369
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,540
use some 3d tricks which way you believe

370
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,060
that is included inside the table but

371
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,390
obviously it is not gone after certain

372
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,940
dose really experts of 3d years in

373
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,550
Butler expect so I do stupid models like

374
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,030
rubber jack which will model guy contact

375
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,780
me please

376
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:10,060
oh so this one is a version of the

377
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,910
portal in SL fashion but this one is

378
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,230
done by a yes yes YouTube is working

379
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,070
again so this one is on marker but you

380
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,900
can use of the streets or something for

381
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,620
arte aqua we go through suddenly we are

382
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,320
in another world but still with these

383
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,190
are real worlds with a portal and we

384
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,130
gonna come back on every time you switch

385
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,160
from a web to the others that's like a

386
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,250
bridge between two world

387
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,930
oops here we go

388
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,700
that's a friend that I have on my desk

389
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,780
so which kind of force application can

390
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,530
you build now we got where they are this

391
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,650
is good because you can build

392
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,890
application on any mobile phone

393
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,340
but which kind of application do you

394
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,799
wanna build because you got tracking on

395
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,500
you good you do portals you do drawing

396
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,059
but it's not really useful so you can do

397
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:19,210
a are gaming so a are gaming obviously

398
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,559
you may have heard of Pokemon go that's

399
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:27,760
one and also one is for example this

400
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,370
game those game has not been done by air

401
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,220
chess but you can definitely consume but

402
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,169
we've a obviously if you have the time

403
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:39,660
on the Internet

404
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,330
this is on pace Vita so they use marker

405
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,470
in order to interact with a with a game

406
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,570
so you move your marker on the table

407
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,929
it moves the object on Ulysses laaser

408
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:59,020
game so these last a being I don't know

409
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,320
how to say that protected you describe

410
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,549
stuff like that

411
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,940
in short your markers are a new way a

412
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,460
new input so this is a lousy game let me

413
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,490
show you other games this one is a

414
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,960
strike race it's a race track after we

415
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,480
had right okay so this was interesting

416
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,090
because this is dynamics so you move the

417
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,970
back around and you change the shape of

418
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,370
the track another game for example when

419
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,809
you yes he's doing that if you are paid

420
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:46,090
but on also ahead

421
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,309
so you can see that the pet is following

422
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:50,860
you when you are moving the Macra around

423
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:58,929
oh I don't know here 51 version inside

424
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:01,470
your retrimmed about it

425
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,980
probably not okay so when you do that

426
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,530
for example so we have seen games or

427
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,179
stuff like that see is one good

428
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:13,380
application that you can do is education

429
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,960
because suppose you are in

430
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,210
cool you put a marker inside your book

431
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,910
on instead of reading a sentence like I

432
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,310
don't know

433
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:27,480
such qing conquest such a country you

434
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,520
can actually do an animation something

435
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,740
funny which can entertain the kids

436
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,190
this way the kid will be less bored

437
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,140
which happen quite often when you are

438
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,650
doing school so it's a very good way to

439
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,160
contact just get to for example so

440
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,840
that's an example and so you can see

441
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,030
some markers on you see an animation

442
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,790
directly on top of the book which is

443
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:01,200
obviously much more entertaining you got

444
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
this one and so you can use a

445
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,970
materiality for example in the industry

446
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,140
it has been shown that with proper

447
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,180
etcetera if you are in the under screen

448
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,860
you'll reduce quite significantly so

449
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,610
error rate so definitely interesting you

450
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,690
can use it for commerce on e-commerce as

451
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,330
well or you can use in for medical

452
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,760
training of subs and also well so well

453
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,220
it all mountain reality right now need

454
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,370
better application we have the tracking

455
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,220
which is good you can produce good

456
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,550
augmented reality on any phone you don't

457
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,990
need to have the latest iPhone or Google

458
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,830
pixel or and so on you can start to

459
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:54,330
build your Barton reality today and you

460
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,070
need to be highly creative that's what

461
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,210
we need at the moment

462
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,380
and we not gonna have questions so

463
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,300
that's the end of my talk partly I

464
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,299
completed results thank you
