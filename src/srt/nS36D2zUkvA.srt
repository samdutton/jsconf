[Applause]

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,620
so hello as you said my name is

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,469
Benedicta and I'm a full-stack

4
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:11,639
JavaScript developer from Oslo Norway

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,780
I'm so still Europe and today I'm gonna

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,240
share with you what I learned so far

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,520
about encryption and that more

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,680
importantly key management when it comes

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,170
to encryption on my quest to figuring

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,390
out how to make a privacy first period

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,520
period tracker or menstrual cycle cycle

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,860
tracker it depends on the but where do

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,829
you use and I hope I can help lower the

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,649
bar when it comes to encryption so that

15
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,420
maybe you also will use encryption in

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,090
your next side project and maybe later

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,190
at work but first we'll have some story

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,620
time for years and years I've been able

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,789
to keep consumer Benedicta away from

20
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,890
developer Benedicta consumer Benedicta

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,199
has been using apps and services like

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,239
most regular users you know I have

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,850
nothing to hide and if I did like I just

24
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,090
don't have the time but then to care

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,939
about it but then this winter the first

26
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,280
kind of major leak that health apps and

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,229
especially menstrual cycle trackers were

28
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,729
leaking data to Facebook through

29
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,180
facebook analytics and later just a

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,799
couple of weeks ago a new report came

31
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,920
out where their attention sharing that

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,740
data with other people some companies

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,390
selling it and some using it for reach

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,030
research which is a good cause but it's

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,680
still something we need to know about as

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,829
a consumer when we make choices so

37
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,049
Benedicta a developer abandoned exciting

38
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,610
consumer benedict's i had to have a

39
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,540
little talk because right after this

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,610
leak came out my period tracker clue

41
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,219
which is one of the nicer ones sent me

42
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,159
this email and it says that only a few

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,320
people have access to the tools we use

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,930
to look into the databases and that

45
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,610
that's the point where consumer

46
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,439
Benedicta realized you know what

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,660
developer Bendix has always known and

48
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,150
that's this data is just there in plain

49
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,050
text I mean it's

50
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,270
in the database and somebody needs to

51
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,240
have access to that database and it

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,980
could be any of you it could be me could

53
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,560
my in my friend from University and with

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,060
some types of data that could just be

55
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,270
you know very awkward conversations or

56
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,920
not like trying to pretend that I

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,410
haven't seen the data so for me kind of

58
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,150
hit home more personally when I started

59
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,400
thinking about that scenario then kind

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,040
of like the big data scenario so in the

61
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,560
back of my mind I've always felt like

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,200
these apps have been very invasive

63
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
they're very detailed they don't care

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
about only when my period is it's like

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,410
how much and for how long and like all

66
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,020
these kinds of weird questions and my

67
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,820
friend who's been single for months

68
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,130
she's tired of getting the question

69
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,140
every day is like have you had sex like

70
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,280
you know yet and like there's been like

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,570
this thing in the back of my mind is

72
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,030
like why are they so invasive and I've

73
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,440
realized of course it's because they're

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,810
going to use this data for something

75
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,700
else so they need a certain kind of

76
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,910
detailed level so my idea of making so

77
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,110
in the back of my mind I've always

78
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,930
wanted to make a less invasive and less

79
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,530
detailed app that would fit fit my cycle

80
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,020
better and I thought if I'm ever gonna

81
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,930
make this I need to learn how to shield

82
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,660
myself from my users data I want to be

83
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,780
one of those can't be evil apps I don't

84
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,110
want to be the one don't be evil so I

85
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,300
sat down and I did what any sane

86
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,190
developer would do is that I made the

87
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,500
proposal that got me on the stage today

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,230
saying stating I'm gonna learn what I

89
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,030
need to learn to make a privacy first

90
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:57,090
app so that's what I did and also while

91
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,910
I was like any old the same developer do

92
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,489
as well while I was procrastinating

93
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,170
finishing these slides I actually took a

94
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,870
stab at making the app so it's called

95
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,880
pal and I launched it on product and

96
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,010
it's a very minimal version and on the

97
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,130
same day that new leak came out so you

98
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,830
know could think that I actually had an

99
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,799
agreement with these journalists because

100
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,260
it was just hours after I released Palin

101
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,790
on product hunt and this

102
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,230
support and attention has been really

103
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,700
it's blown my mind like people are

104
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,650
really interested they really want such

105
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,810
an app so I've decided to just keep

106
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,390
focusing on actually making the app and

107
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,420
we'll try to launch on March 8th 2020

108
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,400
and for those who you don't know what

109
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,080
that day is it's the International

110
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,740
Women's Day so I'm happy to say it seems

111
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,240
like privacy is becoming more mainstream

112
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,030
and people are getting interested in

113
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,700
knowing where their data is going and

114
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,340
also maybe having a say in where it's

115
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,980
going before I go into encryption I just

116
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,580
need to thank Jeffrey Jeffrey from

117
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,360
1password

118
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,790
it was really hard trying to find

119
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,260
information on this topic from a webapp

120
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,640
perspective there's a lot of more

121
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,460
theoretical knowledge but the only real

122
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,150
real content I found on how the full

123
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,320
flow of a web application goes it's it's

124
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,060
this security white paper by Jeffrey who

125
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,200
works at 1password

126
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,080
which is a great app so if you want to

127
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,180
look into it more after my talk which is

128
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,490
very introductory you should try to read

129
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,470
this white paper and I'm a noob I just

130
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,910
learned this and I'm gonna try to

131
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,510
explain how to use encryption algorithms

132
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,280
I will not go into how they actually

133
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,220
work and you will should not try to make

134
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,930
your own encryption that is something

135
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,810
that will take about 20 years to be able

136
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,220
to do if you're gonna do it on the state

137
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,200
secret level yeah you first need your

138
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,820
PhD and then about 15 years of

139
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,170
experience and then you're allowed to

140
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,720
make a crip ssin so that's not for us

141
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,260
mmm and I will not go through all the

142
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,240
attack vectors I will look more into how

143
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,550
would you actually do it because that's

144
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,370
what I found lacking so I'm actually I

145
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,680
have a master of computer science and I

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,110
remember talks about in Christian but I

147
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,070
feel like I know way way too new too

148
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,770
little about it and I'm still as I said

149
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,110
in all of the people making encryption

150
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,080
algorithms but we're gonna go and look

151
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,169
at how to use them and especially key

152
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,259
management as I realized using algorithm

153
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,909
using the encryption algorithms are

154
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:46,039
fairly easy but what to do about all the

155
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,550
keys we're gonna get into so this is a

156
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,120
basic encryption algorithm or encryption

157
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,430
flow you have your plaintext and you

158
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,139
have a key and then you encrypt it and

159
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,449
what comes out is called cipher or

160
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,520
ciphertext and then to get your

161
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,800
plaintext back your reverse t3 order

162
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,300
Commission your decryption algorithm one

163
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,610
of the things that I spent an

164
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,560
embarrassing long amount of time to

165
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,900
figure out this what is this key it's

166
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,849
usually just drawn that's a key the same

167
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,339
way I did and I was like this key it's

168
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,439
you know this sort of magical thing but

169
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,389
it turns out it's a very long sequence

170
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:28,999
of characters and but you use different

171
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,719
algorithms to make them for specific

172
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,009
generate them for specific algorithms

173
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:35,900
but basically they're just real long

174
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,919
random strings of characters and it

175
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,319
turns out that random long random

176
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,000
strings of character is really important

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,099
in encryption and so they even have a

178
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:50,479
word for it called entropy and because

179
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,099
if you have something that's easy to

180
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:54,979
guess then the whole thing would fall

181
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:56,689
apart then you would just guess the key

182
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:59,839
or guess the password and encryption

183
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,520
would fall apart and if you now you know

184
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,930
very obvious crypt developers if you're

185
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,409
thinking math.random right now then that

186
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:12,349
is not a true random algorithm that's

187
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:14,689
something called a pseudo-random they

188
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:16,759
gives you pseudo random values but what

189
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,729
we need is crypto cryptographically

190
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:25,099
strong random values therefore showing a

191
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,139
code example and we're going to look at

192
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,120
the net analogy that's often used in the

193
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,069
crypto world a way to think about

194
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:33,079
encryption is how we secure our

195
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,789
belongings by locking them in to our

196
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,399
house only somebody with the correct key

197
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,339
can unlock the door and get a hold of

198
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:42,620
your belongings the big difference

199
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,230
though is we look something inside well

200
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,360
with the cripton we actually transform

201
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,490
your belongings so the furniture would

202
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,930
no longer be there it would be something

203
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,480
different but we're still going to use

204
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,899
this analogy because it's used a lot and

205
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:59,089
it's easier than like transforming

206
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,430
things into different as substance

207
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:07,370
matter so luckily for us the browsers

208
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,819
now come with dead crypto API embedded

209
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:13,459
so we don't have to do any crypto stuff

210
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,959
ourselves as we should not do and the

211
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:19,610
first thing we need to do is make that

212
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,040
key that we saw in our Krypton algorithm

213
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,069
and before we can make the key we need

214
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:27,079
to decide on what encryption algorithm

215
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,819
to use and from what I've gathered this

216
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,250
is the algorithm we want the advanced

217
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,439
encryption standard with geleris counter

218
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,310
mode so we start by generating a key for

219
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,890
that algorithm and here we say that we

220
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:45,230
want the length to be 256 256 but it

221
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,779
could just as well be 128 and Jeff

222
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,760
Jeffery from one password has a long

223
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,939
blog post about it not really being that

224
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,860
it's not that much more secure with the

225
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,649
250 bit encryption as it's called as a

226
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:00,649
128 bit encryption it's like going from

227
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,490
infinity to infinity he says but but for

228
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,829
the users they they liked the sound of

229
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:10,880
256 over 128 it just sounds more secure

230
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,459
it sounds better so I found that also in

231
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,130
security there's a lot of usability

232
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,649
issues and it's not only like the hard

233
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:21,050
science that they might want you to

234
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,519
believe in you read most of their

235
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,790
literature so we have the key and now

236
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,680
we're going to encrypt our little note

237
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,829
and as some people might notice we're

238
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:35,480
not allowed to work on strings we have

239
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,449
to make buf buffers which I find quite

240
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:40,040
annoying because that's not something I

241
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,579
usually do in my day to day work so as

242
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:46,699
we as we saw on the diagram we input the

243
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:50,860
key and the note and out we get a cipher

244
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,500
and but there's another thing here in

245
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,160
addition it's called it's in a celeste

246
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,160
installation in init vector because

247
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,210
and to counter against something called

248
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,670
cipher attacks that I don't totally

249
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,070
understand we need a different random

250
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,280
value as well but we could save that

251
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,380
together with our ciphertext because it

252
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,330
does not have to be secret so we and we

253
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,630
generated here with that cryptographic

254
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:27,820
safe random value generator so it has to

255
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,580
be a unique for every piece of data you

256
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,650
encrypt but it doesn't have but it

257
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,390
doesn't have to be secret and to get our

258
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,640
note back we decrypt decrypt using the

259
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
same installation vector key vector the

260
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,920
key and we have our cipher test text we

261
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,010
get the buffer back and then we make it

262
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,600
into our string again so that was basic

263
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,510
encryption we generated the key the red

264
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,550
key we encrypted our data and then we

265
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,900
decrypted our data again so I was very

266
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,120
pleased with myself when I got this far

267
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,330
in my exploration but I quickly realized

268
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:12,190
that there's a lot more more to it I was

269
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,260
a lot closer to those two circles than

270
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,440
the owl so I'm going to try not to walk

271
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,360
you through how we generate keys and

272
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
when we use what key to hopefully make

273
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,110
you better equipped to read they've read

274
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,990
content around encryption

275
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,270
we're gonna start start by just assuming

276
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,800
everything is in your client your mobile

277
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,190
phone or your or your laptop and it's

278
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,230
easy peasy we just save our ciphertext

279
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,300
to the local storage but where do we

280
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,350
keep the key so this is our first

281
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,000
encounter with key management if we

282
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,880
stored the key together with our

283
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,810
ciphertext then you know there wouldn't

284
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,810
have been much point in encrypting at

285
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,860
all so let's go back to our house and in

286
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,100
this scenario we're we're gonna look at

287
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,020
a way to do this so it's a little bit of

288
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,730
a stretching so we would probably not do

289
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,500
this with houses in real life but just

290
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,870
bear with me so in this scenario we're

291
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,240
looking at where we'd actually just like

292
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,240
hide the key next to the house some

293
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,330
people would do that for convenience

294
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,050
maybe it would be under

295
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,029
the flowerpot on the veranda or like a

296
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,830
secret spot under the stairs something

297
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,110
like that it's convenient but it's not

298
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,790
really recommended because anybody could

299
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,360
get in your house if they found the key

300
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,940
so therefore you decide to get one of

301
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,370
those key boxes that are more popular

302
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,380
now especially with Airbnb where you pop

303
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,480
your key into key box and then you set a

304
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,269
code on the keyed box and in this way

305
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,430
you can access only you can access the

306
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,680
key with something you remember not

307
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:54,040
something that's stored anywhere so for

308
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,029
to do this we can implement we can do

309
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,209
this in our code as well we can import

310
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:08,200
key by from a password and with this

311
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,300
function called import key and we want

312
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,500
to use the password-based key derivation

313
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,190
function to we ask the user for their

314
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,690
password and then we transform the

315
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,240
password in turkey by using this

316
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,040
function and then again we have to

317
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,660
encode our strings and using that

318
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,430
password key we can derive a key and as

319
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,930
the name implies it's really good at

320
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,510
making keys from passwords but since

321
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,910
user selected passwords are often easier

322
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,490
to guess than something we generated

323
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,709
randomly we also need a truly random key

324
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:48,930
and we add that and we call it the salt

325
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,790
so this function derived key is

326
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,250
determined amidst deterministic meaning

327
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,839
that as long as he prided with the same

328
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,779
salt on the same password the output

329
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:01,570
will be the same so we can generate it

330
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,610
again and/or derive it again and again

331
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,300
and in our case so far we would have to

332
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,000
save that salt together with our cipher

333
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,550
text so it doesn't provide the password

334
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,740
provides us with some extra security but

335
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,810
the salt is not giving us much extra

336
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,120
right now but later on we will see how

337
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,350
the salt can shine so let's go back to

338
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,899
our house there we only had a key luck

339
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,820
with the passcode on it

340
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,470
so we need to get one of those

341
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,860
that has a code and a regular luck I

342
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,200
don't think those exist yet that's what

343
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,480
we're getting and then we take that salt

344
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,330
or that key for the regular lock and we

345
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,550
put that one under the flowerpot so to

346
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,529
get in we need to find the key that

347
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,600
we've hidden very secretly under the

348
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,760
flowerpot and we need to remember our

349
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,830
code then we can get our house key and

350
00:15:51,830 --> 00:16:01,930
we can get into our house so that um

351
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,730
yeah so that was this is our basic

352
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,779
encryption and as you can see the

353
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:11,149
encryption stays the same but we're now

354
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:13,700
deriving the key instead of generating

355
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,440
the key so let's move over to cloud

356
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,080
storage so there could be a case where a

357
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,839
menstrual cycle tracker app could just

358
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,630
store everything locally but consumer

359
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,690
Benedicta has gotten some fancy habits

360
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,420
and she likes her data in the cloud so

361
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,250
she can get access from multiple clients

362
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,339
and also backup so we'll keep going on

363
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:41,450
our encryption and key journey will

364
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,890
start by what goes where

365
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,890
so we'll put our ciphertext in the cloud

366
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,220
we'll keep our salt on the client and

367
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,839
then everything else is kept in memory

368
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,209
the password kept in you know our own

369
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:55,850
human memory and then everything else in

370
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,720
the clients memory and this looks like

371
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,779
this for the user in one password when

372
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,970
you're gonna move between devices this

373
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,829
is where our salt shines because you

374
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,470
can't if you pick up a new device you

375
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,270
will need the password but you also need

376
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,860
the salt so you need access to your

377
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,230
other device to get that salt and you

378
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,360
need to manually transfer it so this

379
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,240
gives us some added benefit instead of

380
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,410
just hiding it in the player of

381
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,579
flowerpot next to the house and one

382
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,679
password calls it the secret key and

383
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,720
they also give us a QR code so it's

384
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,520
easier to set up on a new mobile device

385
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,340
by just taking a photo they also really

386
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,559
want you to print this out and put it

387
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,059
somewhere safe and they have a little

388
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,080
field where you can write in the

389
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,340
password that you're supposed to only

390
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:43,790
remem

391
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,890
in your mind and the reason for this is

392
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,020
that in these kind of privacy first

393
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,230
focused apps if you forget your password

394
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,830
then they can't give you any account

395
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,510
recovery because they don't know your

396
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,370
password and they don't have access to

397
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,210
your content anymore so you really need

398
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,850
the users to remember that password or

399
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,920
print but their secret key and their

400
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,570
password out and put it in a safe or

401
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,730
some or somewhere because you cannot

402
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,890
give their content back to them if they

403
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,970
forget so it's a very interesting from a

404
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,210
user standpoint we need to help our

405
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,370
users to get new mental models about

406
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,410
where data is stored and how it's stored

407
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,390
because a lot of people are very used to

408
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,910
just hitting the recovery or I've forgot

409
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:34,640
my password link a nice thing with this

410
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,830
setup is that something that sounds

411
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,450
really fancy or at least for me sound

412
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,390
very fancy and to end encryption

413
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,400
something that's people say whenever

414
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,460
they talk about cloud and it's not as

415
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,380
hard as it sounds or special as it

416
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,510
sounds it just means that all encryption

417
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,650
and decryption happens on the client and

418
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,000
you know that's what we're already doing

419
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,850
so we have intent encryption down

420
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,980
without much extra effort or with no

421
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,900
extra effort effort again you might say

422
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,700
you know what the sharing have to do

423
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,730
with a period tracker app and over these

424
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,100
last weeks of making it up and started

425
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,230
talking about menstrual cycles I've

426
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,830
talked talked more to more about cycles

427
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,540
with my friends and and other random

428
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,070
people then I think I have in my

429
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,740
lifetime combined and this ID that I've

430
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,130
had and that we've had at home where I

431
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,220
want I maybe want to share some of my

432
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,290
data with my significant others there

433
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,170
are parts of the days in the cycle where

434
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,100
I don't really want to communicate

435
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,050
that's a regular human I just want my

436
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,930
have to do it for me and other people

437
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,700
some people think it's it's a horrible

438
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,010
horrible idea and other people love it

439
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,600
so we're gonna go with the people who

440
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,250
loves it and we're also going to share

441
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:55,610
some of our data so to share data we

442
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,740
need some different encryption

443
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,910
floo and it's called a async encryption

444
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,410
because I'm I always have a problem

445
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,940
saying a is asynchronous encryption and

446
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,040
in this type of async encryption and

447
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,410
there's a different key for encryption

448
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,770
and decryption so see we have the orange

449
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,230
key old old school looking key there on

450
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,309
the left and the purple on the right you

451
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:25,100
could switch these up and use the other

452
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,559
one for encryption and the first one for

453
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,290
decryption and and this this was really

454
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,400
hard for me to understand in the

455
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,200
beginning because they're usually taught

456
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,960
and they labeled public and private so I

457
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,000
thought it was always the public that

458
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,350
had to encrypt on the private that had

459
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,030
to decrypt or the other way around but

460
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,770
you can switch these up and they have

461
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,860
different use cases but for our use case

462
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,450
this is the one we want we want to

463
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,490
encrypt with the public key which is

464
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,290
something that you can freely share and

465
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,360
then we want to decrypt with the private

466
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,210
key so let's go back to our houses

467
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,300
you know hatton you now have a neighbor

468
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,110
and the neighbor has very complementary

469
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,690
tools to use you want to be able to

470
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,429
share your tools with your neighbor and

471
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,410
she wants to share her tools with you

472
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,910
which is really nice as a nice

473
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,790
neighborhood yeah but you don't want to

474
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,500
always have to be at home when she comes

475
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,510
over and you want some way to coordinate

476
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:26,570
the sharing and you could just give you

477
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,730
know give give it to her in the physical

478
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,360
world but this is a special case well

479
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,660
anyway so you put your you can put all

480
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,250
of your tools and she can put all of her

481
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,220
tools in your respective sheds but how

482
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,870
are you supposed to be able to give her

483
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,460
the key if you're not kind of if you

484
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,100
don't have time to meet her and meet her

485
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,700
imperfect person and one way to do that

486
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,380
is that all your other neighbors have

487
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,870
lockable mailboxes so you can take your

488
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,730
shed a copy of her shed key and then you

489
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,559
can drop it in her mailbox and she will

490
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,720
be the only one able to unlock that and

491
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,540
get the key to your shed and the same

492
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,309
the other way around she could take a

493
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:06,380
copy of her shed key and drop it into

494
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,840
your public mailbox and then you will be

495
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,450
the only one able to

496
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,630
open it with the key to your mailbox but

497
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,070
then if you have a key again so you have

498
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,419
the key to the mailbox and what should

499
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,760
you do with this well we'll put it into

500
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,970
that key box again that has a code and

501
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,100
then it has to lock and then you put

502
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,929
that key under your flower button and to

503
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,970
generate these async keys you can use

504
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,769
this algorithm I won't go much further

505
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:40,370
into that they will look at the flow so

506
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,470
for sharing data you'll take your plain

507
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,659
text and you'll let's see no there's

508
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:52,159
something wrong yeah no yes sir

509
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,990
ah you'll take you'll first generate a

510
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,639
key like we did all the way in the

511
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,200
beginning and you'll encrypt the data

512
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,539
with that and you get your ciphertext

513
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:05,570
but then you take your generated key and

514
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,580
you encrypt that with the other person's

515
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,100
public key and you get an encrypted

516
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,740
generated key and you can share both of

517
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,690
those and put it in the cloud and then

518
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,409
to decrypt the other person will take

519
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:23,590
their private key decrypt encrypted

520
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,779
generated key get the generated key and

521
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:30,429
then decrypt the ciphertext to plaintext

522
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:33,200
so as you can see with all these keys we

523
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,059
got a really stay sharp

524
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:40,309
to not mess it up but where you know

525
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:42,080
that private key can't just be laying

526
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,380
around so this is what we do with our

527
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,130
private keys we encrypted with the

528
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,799
derived key and then we can decrypt it

529
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,570
again so if you then look at the whole

530
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,630
flow if I want to decrypt something

531
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,840
shared with me I first have to get my

532
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,690
derived key decrypt my encrypted private

533
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,909
key then I use my private creek to

534
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:07,370
decrypt my encrypted generated key I get

535
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,200
my generated key and I can finally

536
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,899
decrypt my text and I get my plaintext

537
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:14,480
back and this is actually what we

538
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,940
usually do also with things we only want

539
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,610
to share with ourselves we do the same

540
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,220
flow so that it will be the equal

541
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,590
process so then you just use your

542
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,200
public-key when encrypted and then you

543
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
do this whole song and dance to get your

544
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,740
content back so intent ocation I kind of

545
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,720
just skipped the whole authentication

546
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,309
part as you might have noticed we just

547
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:42,289
put things on the cloud and without

548
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:45,110
knowing who anyone was and the reason

549
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,669
for that that it it becomes more

550
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:48,970
problematic than in a normal web app

551
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,010
since we use our password to generate

552
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,080
keys we don't really the password

553
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,450
becomes much more sensitive than in a

554
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,730
regular app so we don't want to send the

555
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,529
password even if it's hashed back and

556
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:03,890
forth between the server to log in and I

557
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,630
haven't been able and one password

558
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,179
called this they've solved this using

559
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,130
something called secure remote password

560
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,350
where you never send the password over

561
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,890
you just do a lot of really cool math on

562
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,929
both sides and you're able to say like

563
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:19,760
we both know the same secret but you

564
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,289
don't send the password back and forth

565
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:23,950
but I've not been able to find any

566
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,169
services that gives us this because all

567
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:28,880
the regular back-end as a service

568
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,919
providers and auth providers they do

569
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:33,110
regular authentication flow

570
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,980
I found one random package on node which

571
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,590
you know I can't just jump jump and use

572
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,539
that without knowing anything more about

573
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:41,750
it

574
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,440
one password has open source to go

575
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,690
implementation if you want to try to

576
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,360
host your own and secure patent remote

577
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,840
password solution but for pow I find

578
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,730
something else it's called block stack

579
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,669
it's a fairly seems to be fairly a new

580
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:00,740
framework for creating decentralized

581
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,860
apps so they have authentication on you

582
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,899
know the blockchain which is very

583
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,610
popular word to say these days but I

584
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,039
find it to be able to use this for POW

585
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,140
is a very practical example of when it's

586
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,929
needed and they're they do a similar

587
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:16,610
thing where you intend to authenticate

588
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,190
without sending the password over any

589
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,740
wires they also help you with encryption

590
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,210
so if you're just going to do simple

591
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,039
encryption it's much easier you don't

592
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,559
have to work with buffer so you can just

593
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:30,260
encrypt strings like you know normal

594
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,500
JavaScript developers would like so

595
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,330
check that out if you want to if you

596
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,710
just want to do some fun side projects

597
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,350
so we're to the main question is it

598
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,140
possible so for my use case it's

599
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,610
definitely possible because we can

600
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,690
encrypt and I have made a version of the

601
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,090
app but I think what is more important

602
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,980
is that more of us especially in the

603
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,870
developers start using encryption and

604
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,240
really taking privacy first to help our

605
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,060
users and educate our users to know when

606
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,370
they share and how that whole flow works

607
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,580
when you do encrypted apps and there

608
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,130
will always be a trust issue because I

609
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,920
could of course do things in the brows

610
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,110
or in addition to encrypting and just

611
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,240
sending off the data if I wanted to and

612
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,430
that's one of the things side projects

613
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,760
and indie developers I think it comes in

614
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,670
our favor is that it's maybe easier to

615
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,590
get the trust and you start with your

616
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,270
friends than it is for the bigger

617
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,900
company corporation so maybe we we might

618
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,210
have a competitive advantage as in the

619
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,870
developers if you take privacy seriously

620
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,980
so my I would like everybody to just go

621
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,080
out and start making your own private

622
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,670
apps and if you want to copy whatever

623
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,860
I've made feel free to do that and let

624
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,090
me know how it goes if you want to see

625
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,700
the slides or codes or a code or

626
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,970
anything you can go to add this address

627
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,270
it's gonna leave it up there for a while

628
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,370
and please come talk to me in the in the

629
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,000
lunch break if you have any questions

630
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,430
and that was all thank you

631
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:14,510
and I also

632
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,790
oh she got lost yeah and also just want

633
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,730
to thank Lilian who made all of the the

634
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,120
beaded illustrations
