00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,040

as a those into my name is Ray vengo and

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,780
I'm a developer advocate for Microsoft I

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,390
focus specifically on Internet explorer

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,580
and Microsoft edge have you have you

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,070
guys heard of those two browsers anybody

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,500
yeah how many guys have had pain points

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,380
with those two brothers all right I

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,970
understand actually i'm going to assume

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,380
you've had more pain points with the

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,270
previous version internet explorer than

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,829
microsoft edge but how many of you

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,030
actually tested out Microsoft edge

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,030
already okay a couple you well hopefully

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,290
I'm gonna help you guys get into

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,000
Microsoft edge and feel a little bit

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,260
better about Microsoft's browser

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,570
strategy that's kind of my focus at

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,220
Microsoft I came back to Microsoft

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,870
because of that because I was really

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,120
excited by what I saw with the new

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,370
browser you know Internet Explorer's had

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,350
a very long history sometimes it was

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,700
really great and sometimes it wasn't so

24
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,680
great but Microsoft's made a very

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,180
different effort and concerted effort to

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,559
improve the browser experience and

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,720
that's where Microsoft edge comes in now

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,689
one of the things that I wanted to do

29
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,220
when I came back to Microsoft was make

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,220
sure that I truly understood the the

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,070
day-to-day work flow of the modern web

32
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,780
developer and it's interesting because

33
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,390
when I rejoined Microsoft back last July

34
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,010
the one thing I told them was all right

35
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,570
well if I'm going to go come back one

36
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,200
thing I need is a macbook so just like

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,510
you guys you guys a lot of you use that

38
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,220
well this is my work machine seriously

39
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,990
this is what they gave me to start off

40
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,130
with and the reason I did this is

41
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,380
because it's how can I have a genuine

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,390
conversation with any of you guys if I

43
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,130
don't know how you're doing your

44
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,130
day-to-day work how can I know the pain

45
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,240
points that you guys are going through

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,210
if I don't know how you're testing our

47
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,100
browser product you guys have you've

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,750
expressed over the many years that I've

49
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,330
been doing this that Internet Explorer

50
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,619
has been tough and now we have a brand

51
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,090
new browser but how can I help you guys

52
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,610
be able to effectively test this out if

53
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,380
I'm not using the same equipment that

54
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,630
you guys are and that's why I ended up

55
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,939
with a mac and you know the mac is a

56
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:10,649
great machine and some of you are on

57
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,590
linux but ultimately i think what

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,120
everybody wants is to be at a code cross

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,819
browser and that's end but in many cases

60
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,069
what ends up happening is that because

61
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,770
you're on a on a oh s 10 or linux you

62
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,590
end up actually targeting this and part

63
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:25,800
of the

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,990
because you're like well how do i test

65
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,550
out internet explorer how do i test out

66
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,590
Microsoft edge when I don't have a

67
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,810
windows pc and that's part of this

68
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,460
conversation and we have a brand new

69
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,200
browser Microsoft edge which is

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,820
fantastic standards-based stuff like

71
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,760
that and I don't want you guys to go

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,830
through what this poor guy did this is

73
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,510
actually a web developer who is trying

74
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,730
to test out area explore in a mac all

75
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,070
right I don't let you guys to go through

76
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,780
that type of stuff I want you to feel

77
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,930
good about doing your day-to-day work I

78
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,120
don't want you to struggle now some of

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,650
the common questions I get is well why

80
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,610
can't you kill off IE all right I I hear

81
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,830
that all the time and you know I I quit

82
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,400
this is something called old IE PTSD all

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,960
right how many of you are feeling that

84
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,540
yeah pretty much the whole entire room I

85
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,920
get it okay well what ends up happening

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,200
is you go to this feeling of all man I

87
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,000
had to support these older versions of

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,880
Internet Explorer and start making

89
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,830
cartoons like this all right where

90
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,450
Internet Explorer is eating paste on the

91
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,770
side while the other two browsers are

92
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,070
duking it out all right and one of the

93
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,840
things that realized over the years that

94
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,750
this is really because it's a lack of

95
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,250
feature knowledge in the community and

96
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,070
this is not something that I don't blame

97
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,330
the developer community I blame

98
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,090
microsoft I blame myself for not doing a

99
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,140
good enough job of getting the

100
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,630
information out of educating you guys

101
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,739
about the things that we're doing

102
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,900
because I feel pretty good about even

103
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,790
internet explorer 11 how many of you

104
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,080
have actually used internet explorer 11

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,510
during your testing or even usage well

106
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,489
you've if you've done that then you

107
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:57,750
probably know that we have a pretty good

108
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,970
level of support of standards-based

109
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,820
features and this is it's amazing what I

110
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,320
encounter developers that don't know

111
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,840
this or that we have some really really

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,850
good toolings using the f12 developer

113
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,860
tools where you can do everything from

114
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,170
obviously script debugging to profiling

115
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,239
to all types of emulations across

116
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,400
different form factors it's really

117
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,109
important now one of the bigger reasons

118
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,090
that I'm an advocate of not killing off

119
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,760
internet explorer's because the w3c and

120
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,500
having multiple reference

121
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,750
implementations of browsers you want

122
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,390
multiple browser vendors out there

123
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,890
vetting these features to ensure that

124
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,380
the features are ready for production

125
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,000
you don't want to go back to the old

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,370
days remember how all these features

127
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,539
were coming out and they were just part

128
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:39,689
of

129
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:42,119
I six and they became standards because

130
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:44,580
one vendor was dominant we don't want to

131
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,749
go back to those days we want to have

132
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:47,159
multiple vendors that are venting all

133
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,409
these features so we have multiple touch

134
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:51,479
points and multiple thought processes

135
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,519
going on about why these features

136
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,439
matters and how they should be

137
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,819
implemented we want a thoughtful

138
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,829
approach having multiple vendors going

139
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,419
out there and thinking about that makes

140
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,039
a lot of sense and improves the process

141
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,189
and knowledge is power I want to share

142
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:06,419
that knowledge with you guys I want to

143
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,769
make sure that you guys have the

144
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,629
information you need to be successful so

145
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:10,589
I'm going to ask all of you right now

146
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,809
real quick just to write down some links

147
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:14,009
that are going to be really important to

148
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,929
you guys okay first one is called Deb

149
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,269
modern-day eat some of you murder may

150
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:20,909
already know about modern-day e this is

151
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:22,800
the tooling site that we produced a

152
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,629
while back that gives a bunch of

153
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,129
information a bunch of tools that makes

154
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,300
your development cycle a little bit

155
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,329
easier so please just jot down dev

156
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,189
modern IE put it into your browser if

157
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:34,079
you have something open and the reason

158
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,610
is because we are trying to be a lot

159
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,039
more transparent about information we

160
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,689
have our road map out in there this is

161
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:41,399
called the status dashboard it's really

162
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,889
important so if you want to see what

163
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,269
type of features we're looking at

164
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:47,639
producing let me spark this up I'll go

165
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,649
here this is by the way this is

166
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,249
Microsoft edge all right some of you

167
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:54,659
admit this may be the first look you can

168
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,399
see it's a very different chrome that

169
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,719
you what you've traditionally been used

170
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:00,149
to an Internet Explorer it's very

171
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:02,099
streamlined but i'm not going to focus

172
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:03,929
on that right now what I am focused on

173
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:06,179
is Deb modern-day eat and this is where

174
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,009
you want to go to it's going to be this

175
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,719
when you want to get the most relevant

176
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,759
information about Microsoft edge and

177
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,219
internet explorer eventually but the key

178
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,839
one is this right here the plot and step

179
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,539
of platform status because this is where

180
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,129
our road maps at if you want to know

181
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,809
what type of status we're at in a

182
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:23,939
specific feature this is where you go so

183
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,889
for example if we want to talk about I

184
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,139
don't know the battery status API what's

185
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,300
under consideration but if you wanted to

186
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,829
know whether we're going to include

187
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:34,379
canvas was already an edge this is where

188
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:35,939
you can understand what we're thinking

189
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:37,919
about and the great thing is that you

190
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,509
have an opportunity now to vote these

191
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,759
features up we if you go to user voice

192
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,209
modern day e you have a choice now you

193
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,379
can look for the features that are

194
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:47,489
important to you and you can vote those

195
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,409
up and the features that get the highest

196
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,749
votes get the attention I think that's a

197
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,999
pretty fair approach to it all right so

198
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:54,270
I want

199
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,650
make sure that you have that link let me

200
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,470
go back to my slides real quick now I'm

201
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,360
going to ask you to just kind of write

202
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,040
these down these are bit ly links now

203
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,810
the IE developer guides every time we

204
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,280
release a version of internet explorer

205
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,140
we've also put in developer guys that

206
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,640
outline the new features that are in

207
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,500
internet explorer and we're going to

208
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,940
continue to do that with Microsoft edge

209
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,560
but it's interesting because it a lot of

210
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,090
developers didn't know about this and

211
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,110
this is really important when you're

212
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,110
trying to think about future features so

213
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,850
bit ly / IE deb guides the I

214
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,570
compatibility cookbook which is

215
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,400
incredibly important because we outline

216
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,420
things that we know are going to be

217
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,310
compatibility issues and we try to make

218
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,170
your lives easier by giving giving you a

219
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,910
heads up of what's happening that way

220
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,930
you can plan your development

221
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,600
accordingly so in this case IE compat

222
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,330
cookbook and then lastly we do have

223
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,520
really good to developer tools this is

224
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,220
not the you know ie8 debug toolbar

225
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,720
thingy majiggy that you had to install

226
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,180
the plugin now these are real developer

227
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,730
tools guys so check it out go to bit ly

228
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,220
f12 dev tools and check it out now why

229
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,990
should I test IE that's another common

230
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,910
question I get you know ultimate is

231
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,070
going to be up to you and your user base

232
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,300
but I wanted to point out a couple

233
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,340
graphs and this is one that always

234
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,860
strikes home fifty-five percent of the

235
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,360
Internet is using Internet Explorer in

236
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,190
some fashion this is based on net market

237
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,720
share now some of you may say well

238
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,890
that's net marking sure what about

239
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,780
statcounter well even with statcounter

240
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,420
22% is still a pretty high figure that's

241
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,160
twenty-two percent desktop market share

242
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,010
worldwide again ultimately you have to

243
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,500
use your own analytics to determine what

244
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,880
you want to test for but these are still

245
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,420
compelling stats all right now the other

246
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,420
question I get is why can't I push

247
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,310
corporations to upgrade how many of you

248
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,870
use any of these services these

249
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,410
companies for services okay look pretty

250
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,030
large number of you okay some of you may

251
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,250
be overseas you may not use this

252
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,750
ultimately these companies have a

253
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,390
responsibility to you guys using chase

254
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,520
of using fidelity all these guys want to

255
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,720
make sure that they manage your

256
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,800
investments they want to manage your

257
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,300
money they want to manage your services

258
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,220
the right way so they have to go through

259
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,590
specific internal auditing services that

260
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,540
are critical to making sure that the

261
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,920
information they're processing is

262
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,690
accurate some of that is government

263
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,120
mandated and some of those are auditing

264
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,480
and certification

265
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,880
on specific software versions how many

266
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,480
of you knew that okay only a maybe a

267
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,550
couple okay this is something that's

268
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,050
really important so when you ask that

269
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,000
question why can't we push companies to

270
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,740
upgrade because some of them actually

271
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,350
have to certify their software to

272
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,529
specific software versions so they

273
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,930
certify to Internet Explorer 8 at a cost

274
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,120
of 10 million dollars they're not going

275
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,949
to want to do that every six weeks or

276
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,829
every 12 weeks the large large

277
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:37,779
investment that they have to make they

278
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,579
have to make sure that they their

279
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,769
software worked accurately so I think if

280
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,720
you make a trade on fidelity you want to

281
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,459
make sure that trade is accurate or when

282
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,019
you make a deposit into chase you want

283
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,339
to make sure your money is in that bank

284
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,170
account right well chase wants to make

285
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,610
sure they can do that same thing and

286
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,930
they depend on software that we produce

287
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,880
as well for that so that's why we can't

288
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,010
push them but what we are trying to do

289
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,750
is give them tools that allow them to

290
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,089
migrate to modern technologies in a

291
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:03,010
little bit more methodical fashion so

292
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,779
for example Enterprise mode Internet

293
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,610
Explorer comes in internet explorer 11

294
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,490
it's a high fidelity emulation of

295
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,019
Internet Explorer 8 that allows

296
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:13,209
enterprises to be to run their legacy

297
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,180
stuff while still focusing on modern

298
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,069
technologies this gives them that

299
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:19,899
migration path they can test out their

300
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,480
old legacy stuff using Internet Explorer

301
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,550
and if it works great that means it's

302
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,380
only one browser running both scenarios

303
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,300
so we're providing that and the other

304
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,800
thing we provide is enterprise site

305
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,899
discovery tool kit which is a tool that

306
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,269
lets them analyze all their applications

307
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:36,519
and figure out which are the sites that

308
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,019
they use the most in which of the sites

309
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:39,550
that they'd have to migrate to modern

310
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,110
technologies based on what they're

311
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,850
implementing they might use active xba

312
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,740
chose or whatever and that way they have

313
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,569
some kind of visibility into what it

314
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:49,680
takes to get them to move forward now

315
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,790
one of the great things i see here and i

316
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,199
want to kind of highlight this graph is

317
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,760
that i'm seeing an upward trend on

318
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,149
internet explorer 11 and that's great

319
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,380
because all the other browser shares are

320
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,510
going down and we want that we actually

321
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,010
want all the older versions of a near

322
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,180
explorer to go down while the more

323
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,889
modern versions go up that means that

324
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,230
it's one less two less browsers that you

325
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,940
have to focus on and i'm sitting that a

326
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,860
net mark share and i'm also seeing on

327
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,209
statcounter so whether you're using

328
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:14,769
doesn't matter which analytic you're

329
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,779
using we're still seeing an upward trend

330
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,120
on internet explorer 11 that's really

331
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,260
important because that means that you

332
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,160
guys are gonna get the most

333
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,680
modern version soon enough and one of

334
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,000
the things that we're doing to help that

335
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,300
is we're giving a Windows 10 away to

336
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,079
anybody with windows 7 8 or 8.1 that's a

337
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,269
free upgrade that's that's a pretty

338
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,470
impressive thing you're talking millions

339
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,540
of users are going to be prompted to get

340
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,939
a free version of Windows this is

341
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:41,949
unprecedented we've never done that all

342
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:43,810
right what that means is I expect to see

343
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,649
a very high usage of Microsoft edge

344
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:50,920
which is what you guys want edge is our

345
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,019
new browser that's going to be standards

346
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,339
compliant there's going to be on a much

347
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,279
faster release cycle and hopefully that

348
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,930
will end up sun setting internet

349
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,389
explorer very soon my fingers breadth

350
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,029
okay now enough of that soapbox talk

351
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,920
what I do want to do is actually dive

352
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,389
into this because I know that we only

353
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:12,250
have a short amount of time I want to

354
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,329
make sure I highlight how do you test

355
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:16,089
Internet Explorer and edge again the

356
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:18,610
microsoft edge deb portal is your home

357
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,620
there ok and i'm going to dive into that

358
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,569
real quick and the reason it's your home

359
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,490
is because basically here is where we

360
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,050
have a couple of options we have

361
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,579
something called remote IE which lets

362
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:29,050
you virtualize internet explorer within

363
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,639
the context of your mac i'm going to

364
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,350
show you how that looks we have virtual

365
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,060
machines for every version of internet

366
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,420
explorer across multiple OS versions we

367
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,980
can also generate screenshots and we can

368
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,660
also generate a quick side scan that

369
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,550
shows different compatibility issues so

370
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,439
if i bring up remote IE which is

371
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:46,329
actually a really cool feature you can

372
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:48,250
go ahead and i'll double-click on ray

373
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,050
bangles internet explorer what it does

374
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,610
is it actually goes ahead and hoping the

375
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,040
internet works connects out to our

376
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,300
remote as our services hopefully login

377
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,880
let's see bear with me one second

378
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,139
connects to our remote Azeris services

379
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:07,389
this works and what will get is a

380
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,490
virtualized version of internet explorer

381
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,500
sitting on my desktop I didn't work that

382
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,490
time let me try this one here with me

383
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:24,470
there we go come on

384
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,459
this one work okay great all right so

385
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,319
here if you look it looks basically like

386
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:31,749
I have a true native app and what the

387
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:32,920
cool thing about this is this is

388
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,359
internet explorer 11 it gives me the

389
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,100
tooling that I want so here's the f12

390
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,989
developer tools and of course i can

391
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:41,350
bring up any site i won in this case is

392
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,209
bringing up modern IE maybe i want to go

393
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:49,239
to blog that Ray bango calm it'll go out

394
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,220
there and bring up my blog now this is

395
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,419
very useful obviously if you're in a

396
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:53,619
staging or in a production environment

397
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:55,600
not very useful if you're trying to test

398
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,609
out a site on your local pc so one of

399
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:58,480
the things that I've actually been

400
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
noodling on quite a bit is how do you

401
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,689
actually do that well the great thing is

402
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,549
i stumbled upon a tool called n grok

403
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:05,350
which is freaking awesome so here's a

404
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,359
little site i have it's called rep chord

405
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,309
i'm going to launch this HTTP server

406
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:10,989
they're launched a little web server

407
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:13,449
here and when i go here to localhost

408
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:15,819
bear with me one second i go back to my

409
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:18,669
browser's you can see it localhost 8080

410
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:21,249
so this is a little CrossFit site that a

411
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:23,049
buddy of mine let me borrow so i can

412
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:25,209
count demo for you guys and this is

413
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:26,410
great on my local machine but i actually

414
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,509
want to see it on remote IE so i'm going

415
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,970
to go back here and let me bring up

416
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,379
another tab and I'll go to end rock and

417
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:38,379
n grok should be in Greco it's say HTTP

418
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,410
i believe is HTTP 8080 and what it's

419
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,999
going to do is going to create a secure

420
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,829
tunnel for me that i can then use to

421
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:47,139
actually bring up the site within any

422
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:49,119
type of remote scenario so in this case

423
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,499
notice that it's bringing up this whole

424
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:53,709
URL here now i take this i'll go back to

425
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:57,220
remote i eat and poop and i'll paste

426
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,989
this right in here and bring it up now

427
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:03,399
what I'm doing is I'm leveraging remote

428
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,980
ie which normally would not allow me to

429
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,679
hit my local server and now I can

430
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,779
actually test it out this is actually

431
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,689
rep cord running on my local box but now

432
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:16,179
I can use it within remote I eat that's

433
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,709
a big deal that's actually pretty hot

434
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,239
this was something that we couldn't do

435
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,759
before but i like i said i want the

436
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,139
noodle i was really frustrating that we

437
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,850
had this great service but you couldn't

438
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,470
ping your local you know your local

439
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,269
resources why would we put that out

440
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,009
there so now with n groc you can

441
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,720
actually do that and the cool thing is

442
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,639
you can use this also for any virtual

443
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,540
machines that you

444
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,550
decide to install on your Mac as well so

445
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,860
we terminate that so you guys you guys

446
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,920
don't hack my machine all right and now

447
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,030
so going back to go back here bear with

448
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,820
no second alright so angaraag is awesome

449
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,560
is to go to anger are calm you can

450
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,850
install it if you have homebrew you can

451
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,050
actually install it via homebrew as well

452
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,330
now the other thing is and we again

453
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,340
remote IE the cool thing about is you go

454
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,320
here you sign in you do have to have a

455
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
Microsoft Live ID but you select your

456
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,070
region if you select your region you

457
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,570
have different ones make sure you select

458
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,860
the one that's closest to you so that

459
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,480
way you get the best performance but the

460
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,860
good thing is again you don't have to

461
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,960
install anything its except for the

462
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,700
microsoft remote desktop app once it

463
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,230
comes up it creates a virtualized

464
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,300
version of that kind of cool stuff now

465
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,100
the one thing that you guys definitely

466
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,600
have used quite a bit and we've actually

467
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,670
seen a lot of stats on this is the

468
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,720
virtual machines how many of you guys

469
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,800
have taken advantage of virtual machines

470
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,780
off of modern done a lot of you and

471
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,850
they're awesome so you know we do have

472
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,730
for Windows Mac and Linux so whichever

473
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,800
operating system is is yours go for it

474
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,510
and the great thing is again we have all

475
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,340
different types of versions this is the

476
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,720
key part of it we wanted to make sure

477
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,610
that you guys can test across any type

478
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,710
of internet explorer version and

479
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,570
operating system version as well because

480
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,370
of course there's nuances depending on

481
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,840
which one you're at so make sure you

482
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,400
select the one you want so let's say

483
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,800
it's a tie 11 on Windows 10 and you can

484
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,570
select your platform parallels

485
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,640
VirtualBox or VMware totally up to you

486
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,260
guys the one thing we don't have right

487
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,730
now is Microsoft edge on there because

488
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,200
it's still not out in production we're

489
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,220
still working on that but there's a

490
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,690
different way of grabbing that so i'll

491
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,940
make sure i show that before we kind of

492
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,880
run out now we also have a screenshot

493
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,770
service i went ahead and ran this ahead

494
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,420
of time so you can see it would it look

495
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,580
like because it does take a little while

496
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,410
to generate the screenshots but here's

497
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,390
the miami herald of course my hometown

498
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,190
paper all right but notice it does give

499
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,600
you screenshots across different types

500
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,550
of browsers different types of OSS and

501
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,470
browsers so it's a nice little service

502
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,480
that against it's free for you use and

503
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,600
also we have a site scanning report so

504
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,520
you put in a URL and it gives you

505
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,860
feedback on what we know are certain

506
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,510
compatibility issues that might cause

507
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,890
you guys problems so in this case for

508
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,120
example notice that they're using

509
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,370
underscore one point oh well we've known

510
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,320
we know just based on information

511
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,880
telemetry we've collected that

512
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,100
underscore one point 0 will

513
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,080
some compat is you go up in different

514
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,700
versions of Internet Explorer so what we

515
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,230
recommend is to go to the next most

516
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,140
compatible version which is 1.7 we also

517
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,750
look for other things like been there

518
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,850
prefixes which we all know if you don't

519
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,890
prefix correctly if you don't go ahead

520
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,210
and do it across from all the browser

521
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,610
versions and browser vendors you're

522
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,380
going to have some quirks some rendering

523
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,179
quirks so we try to give you as much

524
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,280
compatibility information as possible so

525
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,750
you guys can make informed decisions

526
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,150
about your development process all right

527
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,820
now the other service that I recommend

528
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,530
is a service called browser stack how

529
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,750
many of you have used that a couple you

530
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,850
this is a paid service but you know what

531
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,080
its incredible is it's actually

532
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,850
phenomenal the great thing about it is

533
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,039
it's not windows specific it's not

534
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,870
internet explorer specific works across

535
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,970
any type of OS and it's within your

536
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,850
browser itself so if i wanted to test

537
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,679
out windows 10 using internet explorer

538
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,500
11 i can go here it actually sparks up a

539
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,049
session and the cool thing is if i go

540
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:46,419
ahead and start up a local server and

541
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,630
i'll start it up again i can actually go

542
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,169
here back to my browser and i want to

543
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,480
bring up localhost and now within within

544
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,200
google chrome i am testing out internet

545
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,260
explorer 11 running the local site

546
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,409
that's on my peace my macbook all right

547
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:06,940
that's a little inception type of stuff

548
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,980
there all right so this is pretty cool

549
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,780
and the great thing is this is just

550
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,950
through a browser extension that you

551
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,559
install and basically does the local

552
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,570
tunneling for you again it's a little

553
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,909
bit of a you know it's a little pricing

554
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,260
service that you have to pay for but you

555
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,549
know what sometimes you got to pay for

556
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:22,929
the good stuff and I'm a firm believer

557
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,580
that you pay for software that solves

558
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,559
you solves problems for you guys so I

559
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,000
think browser sack is a great piece of

560
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,200
software and it's definitely worth the

561
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,900
investment all right

562
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,950
we also have webdriver support in the

563
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,720
internet explorer 11 I'm not an expert

564
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,070
in webdriver but if you guys need

565
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,660
information on that let me know and I

566
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,890
can get your information and put you in

567
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,420
contact with the team now how do you

568
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,030
test out Microsoft edge well the easiest

569
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,610
way is to download the ISO from insider

570
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,550
windows com so take a moment and write

571
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:58,230
that down insider that windows com all

572
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,660
right this version that the version of

573
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,640
Windows 10 that you saw me running is

574
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,170
the same version that you guys would

575
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,820
download it already includes Microsoft

576
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,100
edge on it so you get all the features

577
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,780
and you can start seeing how Microsoft

578
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,790
edge works on your site you can check

579
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,200
out the rendering the great thing about

580
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,580
Microsoft edge is that we are shooting

581
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,260
for ninety-nine percent compatibility it

582
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,090
compatibility interoperability with

583
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,610
other browsers so your sites should work

584
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,620
okay we want to make sure that they work

585
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,560
and also I have a limited number of USB

586
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,420
sticks that actually have Windows 10 on

587
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,190
it where you can just pop it into your

588
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,230
macbook that's macbook only you pop it

589
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,430
into your macbook you restart your

590
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,990
macbook and it actually brings it up for

591
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,720
you so before the end of the session or

592
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,150
before you guys run out come over and

593
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,190
see me and I'll hand them out I only

594
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,020
have a limited number though okay so I

595
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,340
just want to keep it everybody aware

596
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,400
that now what about mobile mobile is

597
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,720
another challenge obviously for testing

598
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,330
across any type of mobile browser one of

599
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,290
the things that we're doing is we're

600
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,670
coming up with a project called borlänge

601
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,200
s and Vorlon was a project that actually

602
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,490
it's a JavaScript library that allows

603
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,100
for remote communication with specific

604
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,260
individual devices if you've used winery

605
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,490
before for example which I'm going to

606
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,260
talk about here as well it's very

607
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,910
similar winery in that sense the

608
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,230
interesting thing about this is of

609
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,000
course it's Microsoft so you'd be

610
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,530
surprised that we actually releases as

611
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,750
open source and we are accepting

612
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,140
contributions in tint all right but the

613
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,700
cool thing is that it's also has a plug

614
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,980
in a plug-in scenario where you guys can

615
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,080
contribute plugins to the actual

616
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,960
framework itself to extend it out and is

617
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,820
powered by node and socket i/o so

618
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,190
definitely join us in kind of extending

619
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,420
that out I'm going to demo it so you can

620
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,520
see it the other one is winery these are

621
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,570
the two libraries that I've used the

622
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,010
most how many of you use winery in the

623
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,830
pin past ok klipsch a couple you and

624
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,320
winery is another very very awesome

625
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,950
remote testing library which it solves

626
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,230
that remote that remote device

627
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,030
type of scenario let me show you real

628
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,580
quick so what I'll do is I'm going to

629
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,340
actually close these down here and I'm

630
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,280
going to bring up the spark of or lon

631
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,830
first so i got my locals here so i'm

632
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,080
going to go here and then Vorlon is just

633
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,549
a matter of typing in Borland it's an

634
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:10,770
MPN module so i just installed it boom

635
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,679
it comes up and it's listening on port

636
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,809
1337 it's basically a little web server

637
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,809
that just listens on port 1337 and one

638
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,070
of the things that you need to do is in

639
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,240
your code you need to add this

640
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,480
javascript script tag in here ok this is

641
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,179
what actually allows for lon to read

642
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,100
your dom understand what's going on

643
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,900
within your page analyze it and

644
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,880
represent it so now when i go here and

645
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,150
I'll go back to my browser and i go

646
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,900
local hosts 1337 vorlons going to bring

647
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,059
me up a dashboard ok the dashboard

648
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,320
doesn't show anything right now but as

649
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,470
soon as I go into my my app localhost

650
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,679
8080 and let me actually break this part

651
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,510
here boom and bring us here you'll see

652
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,790
that basically I have now a new app here

653
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,980
and it's expects if I click on that it

654
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,570
expands out it shows me my whole DOM and

655
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,770
the good thing is that I can actually

656
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,630
click through here and actually inspect

657
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,700
the individual elements and get feedback

658
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,549
on what's happening so I can't go to the

659
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:11,760
level of doing like script debugging yet

660
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,750
this is something that we're actually

661
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,660
working on as a plug-in but you can go

662
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,549
ahead and have a cab access to the

663
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:19,620
console so if i go here i guess say

664
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:27,840
something like inner HTML equals foo and

665
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,910
i do that and changes immediately there

666
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,590
so you have immediate response and

667
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,690
feedback to understand what the what

668
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,059
changes would happen and you can change

669
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,280
attributes on your CSS as well property

670
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,200
values so if I said margin bottom is I

671
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,080
don't know 50 pixels then it affects it

672
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,000
as well in real time so from a mobile

673
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,590
device perspective this makes a lot of

674
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,630
sense again this is an evolving library

675
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,790
so I definitely ask you guys to jump in

676
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,679
get involved and contribute the plugins

677
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,510
now the other one that I want to show

678
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,470
you is winery so I'll go here and let me

679
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,140
terminate a for lawn and I'll go winery

680
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:12,240
HTTP port and 80 81 all right so I'll

681
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,880
bring up winery now winery is very

682
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,150
similar to this and it's based on webkit

683
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,860
so a lot of the stuff is going to be

684
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,420
very familiar to you guys if you use the

685
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,280
chrome developer tools notice that

686
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,960
nothing shows up now winery has a really

687
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,460
cool little bookmarklet so if I click on

688
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,840
this bookmarklet here notice that all

689
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,210
the Dom shows up now there's a little

690
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,640
bit more of a feature filled type of

691
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,700
scenario so you have access to resources

692
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,040
network timings timelines console the

693
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,780
whole thing it's actually a really slick

694
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,700
thing it's again it's a little bit more

695
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,680
mature but you know we're working on

696
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,820
board on we're trying to make it much

697
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,740
better so I expand this out I can go

698
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,380
here and change different things let's

699
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,140
say I want to go down here and I'll

700
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,270
expand this div out and we're says the

701
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,950
rep cord I can change this out to the

702
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:06,840
record and up its down here someplace

703
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,180
but basically shows real time updating

704
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,250
of the page as well again a little bit

705
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,650
more mature app it's been around for a

706
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,450
long time but this is where you're going

707
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,830
to what you're going to use primarily

708
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,810
for your mobile testing all right this

709
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,070
is what's going to allow you to inspect

710
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,780
the Dom elements check all the

711
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,520
attributes change them in real time and

712
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,650
work with them so Vorlon and winery are

713
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,960
your two choices there's also and I'm

714
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,100
sorry if I'm speaking fast as you so I

715
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,330
know I'm limited on time and I want to

716
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,870
get through this there's also a couple

717
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,370
of other ones Adobe Edge inspect which

718
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,810
is a great tool I haven't used this I

719
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,210
know Brian lose here so Brian maybe you

720
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,180
can help them out later on or not and

721
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,860
ghost lab which is another one that I've

722
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,960
just that I've just recently found it's

723
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,640
a paid service but it also looks pretty

724
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,980
impressive as well the one thing that we

725
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,350
have been pushing for extensively within

726
