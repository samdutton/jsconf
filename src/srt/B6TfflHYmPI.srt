1
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:12,209

well everyone glad you're here and not

2
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:17,960
learning about the namespaces and Yui so

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,759
or dojo so just wanted to start off and

4
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:27,089
say this is one of the best conferences

5
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:29,910
that I've been to in the last week or

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,690
two so actually this year you guys the

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,780
content here is wicked I don't think

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,090
anyone here has said Ajax and not been

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,699
sort of sarcastic about it I think

10
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:43,350
everything that is going on the

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,000
JavaScript space pretty exciting and

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,149
yeah you guys all rock so it's cool to

13
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,109
be here so I'm just going to quickly

14
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,760
talk about NATO because they pay me so

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,670
that's important to me it's found in 98

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,149
it's 15 guys it's a really small company

17
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,360
we're in Vancouver just Canada we're an

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,250
early player in JavaScript air and

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,990
lately we're really into the mobile web

20
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,570
which is something we think is going to

21
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,570
be pretty big and I'm going to talk a

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,470
lot more about that we have two main

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,150
products they're both open source and

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,890
are both based on JavaScript there's

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,200
complete UI which a set of user

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,950
interface components data grids and rich

27
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,560
controls and that sort of thing and then

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,670
there's what I'm here to talk to you

29
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:40,780
about today phonegap so phonegap

30
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:46,190
I think I got back to the hotel last

31
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,530
night like three after eating empanadas

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,770
and I edited my slides and I have no

33
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,780
idea what I was thinking I added this

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,270
one but it's pretty good so oh yeah

35
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:05,500
that's right so um the mobile web is

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,290
huge and it's growing really fast I

37
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,280
think there was something like three

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,720
hundred percent growth in just the last

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,570
month on queries on Google from an

40
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,230
iphone that's insane if there's a

41
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,940
billion television sets and there's two

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,370
billion web enabled phones that speaks

43
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,530
to the opportunity I don't need a bar

44
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,600
chart to show you how much of an

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,640
opportunity that is but there's a

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,530
problem right now with mobile devices

47
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,170
and that problem is best illustrated by

48
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,150
a really complicated chart like this one

49
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,890
or table so there's obviously a lot of

50
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,540
platform fragmentation we've got the

51
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,140
iphone with which has objective c which

52
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,700
it actually it is pretty cool as a

53
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,050
language i recommend learning and i

54
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,630
think it is interesting you've got

55
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,780
android which is also really cool kind

56
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,350
of a beautiful version of java running

57
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,700
inside of it called dalvik which is

58
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,470
quite performing it's just plain old

59
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,090
java objects really simple the program

60
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,850
against theirs blackberries take on Java

61
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,920
which is about as about as easy to use

62
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,080
as their keyboards or their browser for

63
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,130
that matter windows mobile whatever

64
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,860
nokia nokia is actually really cool

65
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,920
nokia does a lot of stuff they just

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,160
don't do any one thing very well which

67
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,510
is what happens when you do a whole

68
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,450
bunch of stuff that they do have web

69
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,209
technology called wrt which is jQuery

70
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,519
base so it looks pretty cool and it's

71
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,160
quite interesting problem is nobody has

72
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,709
nokia phones in north america a lot of

73
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,090
people in europe do so it is worth

74
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,860
watching it's kind of interesting then

75
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,420
there's the palm pre which is coming up

76
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,709
soon it looks like they may have nailed

77
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,480
it with their programming model which is

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,150
HTML CSS and JavaScript

79
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,819
so you know we've seen this kind of

80
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,110
thing happen before platform

81
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,930
fragmentations not not news to web

82
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,410
developers and well it's you know it's

83
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,290
never going to work so what do you do

84
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,239
well you use the web to solve this

85
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,970
problem this slides awesome because

86
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,470
check this tank has a greater than sign

87
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,500
yeah right and that's like the

88
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,200
internet is really like like it's kind

89
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,780
of like you know C programmers will

90
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,370
speak to Rizzoli about your little web

91
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,970
app or whatever but you know writing and

92
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,360
c is really cool and it's really

93
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,370
performant and it has a time of place

94
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,270
but that time in place it's got nothing

95
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,960
on this tank man like a weight's

96
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,940
whatever so i thought i might be a first

97
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,320
guy out of the wall cat and it's kind of

98
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,040
bitter that I wasn't but that's okay you

99
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,510
know people say shouldn't have a walk at

100
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,130
your presentation that's lawl

101
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,350
cats are awesome so yeah anyway so we're

102
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,700
pretty sure that this internet thing is

103
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,660
going to work out and and so when the

104
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,700
iphone was released that was like this

105
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,100
marker got thrown on the ground okay

106
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,140
here we are the mobile web is finally

107
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,030
arrived I've been waiting for this

108
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,910
forever they roll it out and they're

109
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,860
like hey you're going to do all your

110
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,410
apps with web technology like oh my god

111
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,270
this is fantastic this is exactly what

112
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm looking for and then the whole

113
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,280
community went no we want to do native

114
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,740
apps we want to do with Objective C and

115
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,039
we're like wait no no we don't want to

116
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,310
do that actually but people did and so

117
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,960
our team was actually really

118
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,190
disheartened by this because a lot of

119
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,080
work are going to WebKit to make it

120
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,390
quite powerful we think Apple was

121
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,830
planning on releasing a lot more

122
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,120
features into it who knows it's all

123
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,160
speculation but when the SDK came out so

124
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,970
i'll go back so the sdk came out we

125
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,289
started to look at closely and we're

126
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:01,700
like you know how can we still do web

127
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,580
development with the iphone but take

128
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,840
advantage of the native features and it

129
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,070
turns out a lot of this stuff is built

130
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,449
in

131
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:11,139
and so beer being a primary motivator

132
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,150
and I Toby this is Brock wit and he's

133
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,129
one of our main developers and he came

134
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:18,069
up with the whole phonegap concept at

135
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:21,099
iphone dev camp and they had free beer

136
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:23,860
so he got a lot of work done and that's

137
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,029
where phone calf came from so our

138
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,680
philosophy with phonegap and this is

139
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,289
probably a little bit unintuitive to a

140
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,879
Western audience but it's like an

141
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,889
Eastern Zen philosophy Taoist kind of

142
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,960
thing we we don't actually want this

143
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,719
project to have to exist and if it

144
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,430
ceases to exist will have been

145
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,800
successful because what we really want

146
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,169
to see happen is web technology to be

147
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:48,699
treated as a first class citizen on

148
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,580
devices right we know it's never going

149
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,529
to happen in the short term so

150
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:58,899
we have to do it ourselves I think I

151
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:04,770
wrote this slide last night too so

152
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,759
phonegap lets you access the data

153
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,330
features on the phone and by native

154
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,469
features I mean pretty much anything

155
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,029
that the phone can do we want to expose

156
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:20,349
back to JavaScript and God I think I was

157
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:22,389
trying to remind myself that yet so it's

158
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:24,819
open source it's MIT licensed we want

159
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,469
you to take our code we want you to fork

160
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:27,909
it we want you to work on it we don't

161
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,159
want to have any barrier to adoption we

162
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,959
want to see people use it and change it

163
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:36,490
and modify it and do whatever so why

164
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,709
would we do that it's kind of crazy it

165
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,459
makes no sense at all the reason we're

166
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,409
doing it is because we're web developers

167
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,550
right we want to see the web succeed and

168
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,589
well you know that's that's pretty easy

169
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:53,379
to say because it's probably going to

170
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,240
work out like I said before this whole

171
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,639
internet thing is obviously not going to

172
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,789
go anywhere but progress the state of

173
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,209
the art Ford and we all win in that case

174
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:07,360
so here's phonegap right now we have it

175
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,919
working on the iphone the Android in the

176
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,029
blackberry with identical api's BAM it's

177
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,370
my only animation I promise you this is

178
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,750
this is phonegap really soon so we're

179
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,540
do I see that again yeah i'm going to

180
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:32,130
make up for lack of content with effects

181
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,570
so we've got on the iphone the android

182
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,880
the blackberry we're looking at you know

183
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,800
what else is cool too about this that

184
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,780
you have to note is that web kit is on

185
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,150
all of these devices except for the

186
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,970
blackberry so that makes our job a

187
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,740
little bit easier and it also gives us

188
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,480
better rendering engines and I'm not a

189
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,550
WebKit fanboy it's just the reality okay

190
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,150
so let's move on actually you might have

191
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,970
a question about that you're thinking

192
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,460
windows mobile has WebKit and actually

193
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,560
yes you can build web kit on the windows

194
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,140
mobile the thing is nobody really owns a

195
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,640
windows mobile phone so no one knows

196
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,880
that you can do that Microsoft talks

197
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,520
about how they ship so many of these

198
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,340
windows mobile SDKs because they count

199
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,850
visual studio is a shipment of their sdk

200
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,510
so and they it's a free download with

201
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,790
the.net framework whatever so another

202
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,260
way to look at this too is site-specific

203
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,870
browsers which is kind of an interesting

204
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,250
thing there's lots of ways to do these

205
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,950
things maybe the browser vendors should

206
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,230
also be considering giving us better

207
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,330
access to our devices and for example

208
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,850
like if I could use my phone to take a

209
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,740
picture I can use flash to take a

210
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,210
picture and all of our laptops have

211
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,670
cameras built-in well you know why can't

212
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,250
I do that with JavaScript it's an

213
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,220
interesting question so I don't have an

214
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,720
answer for that by the way I don't work

215
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,460
on browsers but so this is also another

216
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,010
interesting recent development Apple

217
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,200
came out with an app store facebook went

218
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,680
oh why didn't we do that and then all of

219
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,120
a sudden all the other mobile carriers

220
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,610
jump on they release app stores and now

221
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,470
Nintendo just announced they're doing an

222
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,020
app store which is cool and interesting

223
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,570
because the d/s is a mobile device so so

224
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,890
there's a lot of opportunity there too

225
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,459
and you probably don't want to develop

226
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:33,870
your app that many times

227
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,210
to get it to market right so how do you

228
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,360
make money as software developers we

229
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,770
probably this is the last thing we think

230
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,010
about half of the time but it is worth

231
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,550
thinking about actually it turns out so

232
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,670
you can do advertising your apps and all

233
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,290
these app stores that there's you know

234
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,790
apps that have examples that there's

235
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,150
freemium apps which means you know apps

236
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,830
kind of free but you have to pay for an

237
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,320
upgrade of some sort subscription based

238
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,029
apps we don't see in the app store and

239
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:07,500
they're discouraged but there are ways

240
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,960
around that such as releasing a single

241
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,029
app for everything like there's you know

242
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,339
10 comic book apps or something like

243
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,940
that so it's kind of like a subscription

244
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,110
value-add type apps had no idea what i

245
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,089
was thinking there who knows you can

246
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,950
probably come up with something I the

247
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,130
app store right now is full of these I

248
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,580
fart type apps and this is just an

249
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,029
unfortunate fact of the market that if

250
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,350
you're going to develop something for

251
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,690
the iphone you're going to run into a

252
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,540
lot of barriers with the time cost to

253
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,310
development and then the price is

254
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,920
getting so low that you wouldn't want to

255
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,060
develop something that has like a

256
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,740
six-month Deb schedule with a team of

257
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,450
five guys you're not going to make any

258
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,970
money and that's just an interesting

259
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,790
thing to note using web technology you

260
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,589
can actually take that time way down and

261
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,610
you might be able to build more

262
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,250
competitive apps and you don't have to

263
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,900
worry about the I far pricing model

264
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,360
something we're seeing happen recently

265
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,520
and it's kind of interesting there's

266
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,500
niche type apps coming up now and

267
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,320
bineesh apps I mean apps that are really

268
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,260
narrowly focused for specific audiences

269
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,500
so one example I saw recently was a

270
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,330
terrier decorator app and you can drag

271
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,730
around like couches and and plants and

272
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,760
it was like 10 bucks right and I would

273
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,440
never buy that but a lot of people

274
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,510
probably would because they like to move

275
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,230
their coaches no yeah and then the last

276
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,839
way to make money is to write apps for

277
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,400
other people which is what you're

278
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,760
probably doing or I'm doing so well one

279
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,980
other thing to note about phonegap is a

280
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,440
good way to look at something is talk

281
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,750
about what you're not going to do and so

282
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,110
we're not trying to build hardcore game

283
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,369
we're not building another browser and

284
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,009
we're not focused on substandard devices

285
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:55,350
so invite substandard devices I mean

286
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,850
anything that anything that isn't going

287
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,860
to be able to compile and run an

288
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,129
instance of a browser our goal is to

289
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:10,589
stay as close to the html5 spec as

290
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,069
possible which is a moving target and

291
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:15,509
also html5 that doesn't really have any

292
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:18,179
do a JavaScript but it does kind of

293
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:20,970
right so things like geolocation but I

294
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,769
don't think the guys at w3c are thinking

295
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,990
about accelerometers even though every

296
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,369
computer has one so it's kind of an

297
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,139
interesting thing so we're trying to

298
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,899
make our API as close as possible to how

299
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,119
the web itself will probably evolved so

300
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:39,990
let's get into some code I put this

301
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:47,819
unicorn up here for you Tom this is a

302
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:52,290
really simple basic example of doing

303
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,519
geolocation with phonegap we start off

304
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,259
with the debugger which will come back

305
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:00,959
into apples xcode so we're going to get

306
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,309
your current location we start you know

307
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:06,179
and a pass you can this person user or

308
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,129
can this app use your location well

309
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,480
that's what's going on we say navigator

310
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,009
done notification or activity start

311
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:13,889
we've got a success callback or a wind

312
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,730
call back and we've got a fail call back

313
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,230
that's it that's how access to your

314
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,149
location of a phonegap it's pretty

315
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:26,069
simple accelerometer was the next thing

316
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,660
that we added pretty much immediately

317
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,299
and I don't think it it can get much

318
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,100
simpler than that there's a function

319
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,649
here called round number which i forgot

320
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:35,910
to strip out but it was just like a

321
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,470
helper function inside this method as

322
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,029
these examples go on you'll see that

323
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,869
I've got pretty much we have the same

324
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:47,040
convention all the way through we will

325
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,170
say navigator dot whatever the feature

326
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,709
is and then I you know callback function

327
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:56,279
and love success a failure function and

328
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:56,780
then

329
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,210
any options which is an object literal

330
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,830
we've recently added contact support

331
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,100
it's still a little fuzzy but it's also

332
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,650
quite powerful and interesting we just

333
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,110
returned well the first time we added it

334
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,790
all we did was return an array of

335
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,620
objects that made a lot of sense and

336
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,600
then this guy hit the mailing list he's

337
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,370
like well I have 6,000 contacts in my

338
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:25,010
phone really dude I've got like

339
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,820
eight but so we had to think that one

340
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,990
through because you don't want to load

341
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,330
that many people and do into an instance

342
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,120
of web can it just takes forever so

343
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,510
we're we've reworked the API with these

344
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,690
constraints in mind I don't even know ed

345
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,310
i added this because i thought i'd be

346
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:51,710
funny last night apparently whatever so

347
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,700
you can do other stuff with phonegap we

348
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,080
have a whole bunch of notification

349
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,430
events the different devices have

350
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,840
different ways of notifying you

351
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,540
different stuff and so that's a really

352
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,080
complex sentence for a simple idea

353
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,220
you've got like on the black bear you

354
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,780
got all these little lights that you can

355
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,790
make blink for whatever reason if you

356
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,270
were you know inclined to do so android

357
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,240
same kind of thing we can play almost

358
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,390
any audio in the iphone sdk there is a

359
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,320
restriction that we can't play anything

360
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,020
more than 30 seconds so you could loop

361
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,360
and you can get clever with that there's

362
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,730
obviously ways around that but we're

363
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,350
trying to keep phonegap within the

364
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,280
sphere of apples legalese which is a

365
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,650
labyrinth amazed at best but it's an

366
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,320
interesting thing and you can play most

367
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,450
video files as well which is kind of

368
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:50,000
cool so a phonegap is quite adopted we

369
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,030
don't know how adopted exactly because

370
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,150
it's MIT licensed when people do want to

371
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,730
promote to us they'll tell us we know

372
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,440
there's a minimum of 50 apps in the App

373
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,620
Store so that's kind of cool and rather

374
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,140
interesting there's lots of forks on

375
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,770
github so if you're if you're on github

376
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,050
I encourage you to get up there and take

377
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:17,360
it for yourself so web apps are pretty

378
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,680
easy to build when it's just a

379
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,560
client-side code and that's all you have

380
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,190
to deal with when you're building a

381
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,230
phonegap application so I could really

382
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,210
get deeply into this but I'm fairly

383
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,800
certain most people here are comfortable

384
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,710
with HTML CSS and JavaScript so I'm just

385
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,210
going to talk quickly about some of the

386
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,580
neat capabilities oh yeah and and I'm

387
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,950
going to do a little WebKit fanboy bit

388
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,270
here a WebKit is winning it's it's just

389
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,970
a fact it's it's an amazing browser it's

390
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,570
fast it's got a tiny footprint and it if

391
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,330
you build your app correctly you cannot

392
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,580
distinguish a web app from a native

393
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,780
application with WebKit and that's just

394
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,240
a fact and the quickest easiest way to

395
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,930
build a web app right now is with dash

396
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,630
coat how many people here have even know

397
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,320
dash code exists yeah right it's kind of

398
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,670
interesting because Apple spent a lot of

399
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,030
time on it and it has a way to publish a

400
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,010
web app it's not just for publishing

401
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,620
dashboard widgets and when you do it it

402
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,600
does it to the dimensions of an iphone

403
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,870
and it's got libraries for all the

404
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,390
native controls that you have on an

405
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,580
iPhone but done with javascript and HTML

406
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,560
CSS so that's kind of an interesting

407
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,630
thing that got overshadowed when the SDK

408
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,170
came out nobody noticed this it just

409
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,270
came out and i think they announced at

410
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,550
the same time and I ones like oh yeah

411
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,950
whatever dash could I can't wait to get

412
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,020
into this objective c man it's going to

413
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,870
be awesome so it's worth checking out

414
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,910
it's the only problem with it though is

415
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,080
if you build an app using dash code it's

416
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,600
not going to work the same in android

417
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,880
and it probably won't even build a load

418
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,470
inside of whatever browser that

419
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,080
blackberry is currently using so that's

420
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:14,240
something to note I you I I I like I you

421
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,980
I I think it's really cool as developed

422
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,600
by Joe Hewitt who you have to respect is

423
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,970
when probably the best mobile developers

424
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,180
out there it it

425
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,890
really hasn't seen any love it doesn't

426
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,140
take advantage of CSS transitions and so

427
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,990
it it looks sort of know if you've seen

428
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,690
an iui up it looks choppy and clunky and

429
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,920
it's based on linked lists which gets

430
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,420
boring really fast if you're just like

431
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,920
going through like list after list after

432
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,720
list like okay that's it that's all

433
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,900
there isn't this out so it's worth

434
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,610
looking at there's a new one called

435
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,710
magic framework it's jQuery based it's

436
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,200
pretty simple and it's a lot like I you

437
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,030
I it's worth looking at if you're going

438
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,890
to build a mobile web app jqtouch is

439
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,110
probably the hottest one right now that

440
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,990
everybody's getting into using it is

441
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,530
also jQuery based and it's quite fast a

442
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,410
problem with jquery on the phone is that

443
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,990
it's huge and that's not such a problem

444
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,330
but it takes a long time to load and you

445
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,710
you pay that a performance penalty

446
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,200
upfront for that when it loads that

447
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,150
JavaScript into the interpreter there's

448
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,730
just almost like a shrug well that phone

449
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,500
gets used to the idea that it's got all

450
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,870
this code inside of it and so you don't

451
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,520
actually need a lot of that code unless

452
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,400
you're using something like jqtouch we

453
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,590
developed our own little mini solution

454
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,780
to it which we called xui and it's

455
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,850
experimental it it's almost identical

456
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,870
syntax jquery except for its 2k instead

457
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,350
of 24 K or whatever jquery g zips down

458
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,350
to and that leaves you room for your app

459
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,910
logic so you could load your app really

460
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,670
quickly you can build whatever it is

461
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,110
you're doing in a familiar way because

462
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,530
we're just using jquery and you don't

463
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:05,460
have the performance overhead of it

464
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,700
something else worth doing if you

465
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,190
haven't is and this seems like heresy I

466
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,500
think everyone should try and write

467
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,020
their own framework before they jump

468
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,560
into using a framework that's you know

469
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,970
why would you do that that's crazy well

470
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,560
as a practitioner of the craft of

471
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,650
building web apps with the lingua franca

472
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,160
of Frank whea whatever that word with

473
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,830
the with JavaScript it's your it's

474
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,300
almost your job to know it and

475
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,470
understand it you know if you don't know

476
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,090
about query selector all you're missing

477
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,950
out it's really cool technology it's

478
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,380
interesting you don't need sizzle half

479
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,230
of the time if you don't use document

480
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,000
get element by ID then you probably

481
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,100
don't like typing and I don't blame you

482
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,350
but you should try rolling your own at

483
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,929
least once something else it's tricky to

484
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,370
build web apps for the iPhone because

485
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,559
the screen resolution so small the

486
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,380
emulators are really not good at

487
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,909
emulating what the phone experience is

488
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,190
exactly like and so you do a lot of this

489
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,750
sort of build and then test on your

490
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,480
phone and build and test on your phone

491
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,539
if you write unit tests up front you're

492
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,120
going to save yourself time later and if

493
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,799
you're using fire bug light embed it

494
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,120
inside the browser you can get a good

495
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,299
idea what's going on that's all I have

496
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:32,030
all right so

497
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,970
somebody was talking about hoverboards

498
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,540
last night which is kind of cool what's

499
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:44,230
coming next with phonegap oh yeah so

500
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:49,420
it's not just about phones that there's

501
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,480
a lot more than mobile devices and then

502
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,340
then just phones in the Tendo d s is a

503
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,690
pretty good example of this it has a

504
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,080
browser it's a little mini platform unto

505
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,960
itself we're seeing the internet kind of

506
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,850
pervade areas that we hadn't thought it

507
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,040
would or at least we didn't know it was

508
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,770
going to and we want to be cognizant of

509
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,960
that I don't know why there's new walk

510
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,600
there something we're exploring is gecko

511
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,220
rendering the reason for this is because

512
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,560
WebKit is winning so we're looking at a

513
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,890
potential of using gecko and making it

514
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,960
the rendering engine and making that

515
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,390
transparent we've had some success with

516
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,080
the iphone not so much with Android you

517
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,330
can build gecko to Windows Mobile which

518
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,530
is cool fennec is a browser for Windows

519
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,390
Mobile that's based on firefox so that's

520
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:53,170
something we're looking at I more

521
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,330
devices blackberry please oh yeah I had

522
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,420
a blackberry because we've been we've

523
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,980
been trying to get ahold of someone at

524
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,820
blackberry and asked them why they don't

525
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,950
use a real browser and they won't get

526
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,110
back to us on that so maybe they will

527
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,760
open toolchain something else we're

528
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,050
looking at adding right now if you want

529
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,730
to build an iphone app you need a mac

530
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,790
and you know like mac users just such a

531
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,070
minority we want to make sure that we

532
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,960
can also help out our friends in the

533
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,600
windows world linux to uh yeah so this

534
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,100
is also something cool that we've been

535
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,600
working on recently and i'm going to

536
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,050
jump out and we're trying to name it I

537
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,910
wanted to call the stimulator but nobody

538
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:43,630
was into it

539
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,020
no spaces there we go so this is pretty

540
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,670
cool actually this is the the phonegap

541
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,460
stimulator if I want to like watch the

542
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,070
accelerometer we can use this little guy

543
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,510
over here this is an adobe air

544
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,950
application by the way I would have

545
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,020
built it with or we would have built it

546
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,580
with titanium but you can't do this cool

547
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,010
paper vision of 3d like rotation stuff

548
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,890
with titanium at least not yet to my

549
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,260
knowledge geolocation is not going to

550
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:23,640
work I think it beeped yeah it's not

551
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,110
very exciting whatever vibrate blank you

552
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,550
know I mean this is pretty basic stuff

553
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,610
is like a nifty way to like move it

554
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,640
around and get orientation change events

555
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,850
we can change the skin to like an

556
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,150
Android to get an idea of like what

557
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,000
that's going to look like you know or

558
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,190
you know we're a masochist we can also

559
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,940
change the skin to blackberry bold which

560
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,650
you know that's probably how it will

561
00:25:52,650 --> 00:26:00,290
render in a blackberry the palm pre oh

562
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:07,710
that's hot yeah anyway so back to the

563
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,860
old iphone i think yeah we've got some

564
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,750
other demos in here too so like this is

565
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,730
and i can show you the source code in a

566
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,680
second can you guys yet ball in there

567
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,200
it's not showing up super well but we

568
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,900
can we built this little game with like

569
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,830
hardly any JavaScript at all and you

570
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,980
know that's not very exciting this is

571
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,930
way cooler this is actually hard well I

572
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,910
have a difficult time with it but yeah

573
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,790
i'm using the accelerometer to navigate

574
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,010
this dude around and if i hit the spikes

575
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:44,130
at vibrates so that's pretty gnarly this

576
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,230
is this thing's going to be completely

577
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,300
open source to we're going to release

578
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,820
this on github let anyone work on it

579
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,710
we're embedding Firebug light inside of

580
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,990
it as well so you can do

581
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,670
any kind of debugging that you used to

582
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,370
probably in that side pain and then just

583
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,850
use the other side to interact with the

584
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,910
code for that first demo I mean it's not

585
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,990
the most beautiful code but that's it

586
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,290
right there so all we're doing is watch

587
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,700
I have no idea what's going with the

588
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,490
indentation all our day is watching the

589
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:27,790
accelerometer we never fail apparently

590
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,900
and yeah then we just move the ball

591
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,110
around using this method right here

592
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,150
there's no frameworks there's there's no

593
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,210
real magic it's just simple simple HTML

594
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,929
CSS and JavaScript here's the the other

595
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:48,020
game with the vibrate built-in I mean

596
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,690
that's not much code for the effect and

597
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,240
it's pretty hard to tell once that's

598
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,920
running on the actual device that it's

599
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,790
oops pre hard to tell that it's just

600
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,770
HTML CSS and JavaScript so it's pretty

601
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,270
cool we're working on a whole bunch of

602
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,200
interfaces right now for phonegap and

603
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,210
really we're driven purely by a need to

604
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,760
try impossible and so we're

605
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,309
looking at adding speech API google

606
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:22,170
android has this or the new sdk has a

607
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,500
speech API but it's not real time and so

608
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,550
that's not good enough we're looking at

609
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:34,260
adding a couch like SQL Lite wrapper be

610
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,920
even cooler if we could add couch itself

611
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:43,020
Chris we're looking at adding a socket

612
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,540
API file i/o you can already send

613
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,950
telephone events back through phonegap

614
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,720
so you can invoke like the phone

615
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,309
interface and an SMS interface just via

616
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:58,950
a href so you just do tell colon slash

617
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,630
slash and telephone number boom you'll

618
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,550
pop it open so it's kind of cool we want

619
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,900
to actually make that even more

620
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,820
interesting and add programmatic access

621
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,380
from JavaScript

622
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,260
so you can build gnarly auto dialers or

623
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,170
something I don't know another friend of

624
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,180
ours back in vancouver added Facebook

625
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,660
Connect which is neat so you can you

626
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,800
know do your authentication with

627
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,940
facebook as well everyone has it i guess

628
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,250
this is the last bullet here is really

629
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,810
new and i didn't even know it was coming

630
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,900
until like two days ago we had a fork

631
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,520
happen a friend of ours in vancouver

632
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,690
decided to just go gonzo and he added

633
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,980
half of the native controls that are

634
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,200
available and you just add them back

635
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,510
into your phone gap application using

636
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,580
CSS so if you want a native tab bar you

637
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,220
can just say class tab bar and then a

638
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,710
list items inside of it links will be

639
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,240
the links that you can use them like the

640
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,190
bottom tab bar it's a little bit of a

641
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,440
tricky one though because you can't do

642
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,890
that kind of cross-platform stuff the

643
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,420
controls that are native to an iphone

644
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,950
are native to the iphone you're not

645
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,420
going to see those on an android so we

646
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,890
want to be cognizant of that you're

647
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,180
doing development that some people just

648
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,070
don't care they want to build iphone

649
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:14,820
apps so here's some resources i'm gonna

650
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,200
put these slides online anyways you'll

651
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,280
be able to find them you don't need to

652
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,930
like quickly jot all this down we need

653
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,750
your help guys weren't you know we're

654
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,480
not a big company and the the project is

655
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,610
ambitious at best we especially need

656
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,180
documentation tends to be a problem test

657
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,540
specs code ideas we want to see people

658
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,080
fork it on github and take phonegap in

659
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,700
directions that we don't expect it to go

660
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,940
in and that's that's where all the cool

661
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,580
stuff happens to us so you know please

662
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,530
do take our code and do something with

663
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:55,140
it and let us know about it more

664
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,280
resources and yeah that's all I got for

665
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:07,770
you yes it's in android there is no SQL

666
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,540
Lite support side blackberry

667
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:17,810
iphone and android yeah yeah oh so the

668
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,000
area the webs are cool but the problems

669
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,830
they don't work when you go offline low

670
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,010
bandwidth go to the Metro what I support

671
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,140
is that there's full offline support for

672
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:34,050
phonegap in so let me show you and

673
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,560
probably pursue a delay right yeah

674
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:43,930
partly I'll just pop the whole tree open

675
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,480
so when you download the phonegap source

676
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,600
can you guys see that that's what it

677
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,800
looks like it's pretty straightforward

678
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,380
we've got a Java scripts directory which

679
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,160
has a whole bunch of interfaces so this

680
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,080
isn't implemented this is just an

681
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,150
interface so let's say you take a

682
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,680
picture of the camera for example and

683
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,180
then it gets implemented different ways

684
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,400
for different platforms in the case of

685
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,910
the iphone we have a WWF older that

686
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,640
example app that i was showing this is

687
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,650
it right here it's all offline and so

688
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:26,810
yeah you yeah yeah you could if you

689
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,030
wanted to you'd have to code that into

690
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,640
your logic when you build it but it's

691
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,500
fully doable some people just use this

692
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,750
HTML file as like kind of a shell and

693
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,670
then they'll keep all their assets in

694
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,740
SQLite database and eval them and the

695
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,450
phone starts up and then you could do

696
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,610
like a call back to the server say hey

697
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,590
is there a new version cool update this

698
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,130
database boom run the app so offline is

699
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,660
fully supported there are any other

700
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,920
questions yeah is so when you're running

701
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,950
an application from gap is when it's

702
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,630
being executed as it actually be thank

703
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,940
you

704
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,530
yeah it's an instance of it's an

705
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,530
instance of WebKit so every application

706
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,750
building this is everything the Franklin

707
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,840
yeah are they are you guys going any

708
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,690
options to like say we will have this

709
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:22,300
build down to man code well it uses the

710
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,700
SDK the iphone sdk so at the end of the

711
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,010
day it is native code i guess underneath

712
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,780
it all but i think what it is like the

713
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,730
like i have actually run applications

714
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,070
and go on gas javascript in a becks to

715
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,900
patrol because it's the language that a

716
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,490
maze a little cleaner maybe that just to

717
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,100
see ya in it but actually have that

718
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,290
compiled down to the native application

719
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,450
that broadens that's not the morning to

720
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,340
WebKit it's actually well that that is

721
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,990
how it works like it's it's a native

722
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,150
springboard app it's a chromeless

723
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,550
instance of WebKit with native features

724
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,470
just injected it like we pollute the

725
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,480
javascript with you know awesome

726
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,700
basically yeah so you're you're looking

727
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,149
to support free when it comes out

728
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,330
totally hopefully soon yeah obviously

729
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,490
it's already or it's going to be built

730
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,369
on that same stack so i guess well

731
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:21,050
phonegap basically just a simple little

732
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,119
train one what's the benefit of using

733
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,760
phonegap of your target yeah so we're

734
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,929
ready me a ship for the the Mojo SDK so

735
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:32,210
that your code would be portable between

736
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,050
from iphone android free so that's

737
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,710
that's our approach there there any

738
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,590
other question yep yeah as i

739
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,300
understanding you go to build a web app

740
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,760
you can i'll down install just that app

741
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,950
kind of isn't is a native pump through

742
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,460
the store save me working with i say for

743
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,619
targeting the iphone yeah but if you say

744
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:56,450
want to use it more as a platform is

745
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,609
anybody any of you guys and you know

746
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:00,680
what you do is you bridging the gap that

747
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,320
the operator that the native browsers

748
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,240
don't allow you access to the to the

749
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,310
native services sure you know there's

750
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,320
movements to try to try to push that to

751
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,750
build with like basic building code web

752
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,609
apps it can kind of do the hybrid man

753
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:16,100
ninja provide this is buddy or has been

754
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,720
able to get through say the apple store

755
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,820
and more of a platform type of

756
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,650
application that will allow you to say

757
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,530
had if you had multiple yeah business or

758
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,359
multiple applications that you wanted to

759
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:29,210
code to that api in a sense you can

760
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,390
install in a browser yeah like a wrapper

761
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,740
of some kind yeah there's there's a

762
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,540
couple examples of this where people are

763
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,790
because phonegap work since there's two

764
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,380
ways when you're actually building the

765
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,660
app you can point at a remote URL or you

766
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,300
can do offline and there are apps in the

767
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,190
store that like point to a remote URL

768
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,560
you could use this in a shady way right

769
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,270
you could like you know have your

770
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,070
kitten's app and turn it into like nasty

771
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,050
porn app and a week if you wanted to but

772
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,540
no they gate no one's done that yet but

773
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,920
they're there have been examples where

774
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,960
people progressively enhance their apps

775
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,940
over time and added like new

776
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,770
functionality and features and you could

777
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,080
you can almost turn it into like a mini

778
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,750
portal for whatever specific yeah so

779
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,310
yeah it people have done it and you

780
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,900
could do that and apples let stuff

781
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,000
through that is like that okay this was

782
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,140
wondering i mean one of that one of

783
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,609
these we're talking some folks recently

784
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,380
bad is to doing that install an app that

785
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,270
kind of starts with a single focus that

786
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,280
they get add more capabilities to it

787
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,440
essentially becomes more the launcher of

788
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,440
their own private suite of mobile

789
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,020
application so it's totally doable yeah

790
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,380
there any other questions yeah that's

791
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,070
all face on that which of my nursing me

792
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,950
was the apple / stricted you from

793
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,990
running anything with a lot of amenities

794
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,130
like stories they do except for they

795
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,660
ship with web kit which is gut um

796
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,510
javascriptcore or scroll whatever so you

797
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,260
can your it's fully allowed by the sdk

798
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,180
is there another question yeah is there

799
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,100
going to be a feature detection billions

800
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,900
in the API so for instance you're saying

801
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,520
some of the phones to support sequel

802
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,020
life is be some sort of a Lillet is

803
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,250
saying if the sequel lights accordingly

804
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,130
than do so so yeah totally we've got

805
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,920
device and platform always return back

806
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,850
and you can do you can test against that

807
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,110
although it would probably make more

808
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,000
sense if you depend on a specific

809
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,910
feature to test the feature returns null

810
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,560
or something like that so be depending

811
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,870
on I'd had to say if you not that Gator

812
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,850
blackberry than SQLite is not usable

813
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,950
instead of SQLite support is equal to

814
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,220
Teresa yeah yeah it'd be Europe it'd be

815
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,200
up to you to do that although i would

816
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,580
like to entertain better ways of doing

817
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,860
that I didn't really good it is it is

818
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,920
did you wait we should make your

819
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,160
application with poem yes you I use are

820
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,900
you installing a new browser on the

821
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,480
phone or is it I'm using the browser

822
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,130
that's already on using the browser

823
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,560
that's already on the phone are using an

824
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,910
instance of the browser that's on the

825
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,810
phone so you're building it like a

826
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,640
native app and it'll have like an icon

827
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,930
on the springboard in the case of

828
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,810
Android and iPhone apps and it'll be

829
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,550
just like another native app except for

830
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,410
it's really just a windowed browser or a

831
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,840
chromeless browser so if you want to

832
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,150
explode more data functionality it as an

833
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,950
app out there you can drop down to do

834
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,670
get see you right there yes yes and we

835
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,320
encourage people to do that totally and

836
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,610
it's really simple the way that it's

837
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,920
architected you you can add the features

838
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,740
and it when you call them from

839
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,180
JavaScript it just mimics the

840
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,420
objective-c so we look for a call if

841
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,680
it's not it's almost like a method

842
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,690
missing and Ruby similar kind of

843
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:49,050
delegate approach
