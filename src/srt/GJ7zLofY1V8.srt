1
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,880
I'm Constanza.

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,450
I'm from Buenos Aries, Argentina.

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,660
And I'm a frontend developer at an E Commerce
country from South America.

4
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:39,120
I'm part of Chica its program, we are women
and we host meetups and create a platform

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,220
for displaying with women and nonbinary Devs
to give them more visibility.

6
00:00:47,220 --> 00:01:00,310
But now I'm here to talk about life, robots,
and cats!

7
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:06,950
Three of the most popular things on the Internet,
right?

8
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:17,060
We're going to see in this presentation with
life and designing and it's main part.

9
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:24,450
Building the building process and potential
use cases of home automation.

10
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:32,549
So, when I was a 4yearold child my family
made me clean up my bedroom, put the toys

11
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,320
away in boxes and do the dishes.

12
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,130
And sometimes sweep the patio.

13
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:47,579
By then I was so angry because all I wanted
to do was to play with my friends and toys.

14
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,579
Right?

15
00:01:48,579 --> 00:02:04,329
So, I

16
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:12,079
used to have this dream that was about creating
robots that could help me with these chores

17
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:14,590
I had.

18
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,349
But then I grew up.

19
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:25,439
And I still have chores even more than before.

20
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,150
And now I have two cats.

21
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,069
Orson and Heckl.

22
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:36,599
And sometimes they had to be they had to wait
for me to be fed.

23
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,379
Needless to say, I rarely get home early.

24
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:53,040
If I give them the day serving in the morning,
they ate it by noon and when I get home at

25
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,659
night, they're hungry.

26
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:03,569
So, I needed to figure out a way to give them
their serving twice a day.

27
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:04,819
Right?

28
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,079
Okay?

29
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:15,719
And so, now I know that's why I decided to
build this.

30
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:22,749
I know nowadays there are a lot of options
that fill our needs.

31
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:29,639
But some are expensive, and I can't afford
them.

32
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,180
That's the reason why I built the pet feeder.

33
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:43,870
So, then I started Googling similar projects
that could guide me in the development.

34
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,379
I saw a lot of the examples.

35
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:52,719
Most of them were built, and the structure
was just for one cup.

36
00:03:52,719 --> 00:04:00,689
However, what I needed was something that
could feed both cats at the same time.

37
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:09,680
Because I don't have much space in my home
and because it's cheaper than having two machines,

38
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
right?

39
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,539
So, I knew that I will need a dispenser as
a container.

40
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,789
Several motors to move the container legs.

41
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:23,409
And a microcontroller to run program.

42
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:27,550
But I didn't know which one.

43
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,650
Because there are a lot of it in the market.

44
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:40,629
So, I had to decide if I will use a Raspberry
Pi or an Arduino or something else.

45
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:49,970
For some reason I thought that a Raspberry
Pi would be the best option due to how easy

46
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,060
to work is its operating system.

47
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:04,610
So, someone lent me a Raspberry Pi which I
had to configure it from scratch as well.

48
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:12,639
And I decided to use JavaScript develop the
feeder because I'm learning to program with

49
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,639
this language.

50
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:22,840
So, I made research and found a platform called
Johnny 5 that allows you to work in robotic

51
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,650
systems with JavaScript.

52
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:40,419
But before using Johnny 5, I installed RasPiO
which is a plugin that allows you to use Johnny

53
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:45,830
5 in the Raspberry Pi.

54
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,300
I used packages for run for all of this stuff.

55
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,639
I used NodeJS.

56
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,240
So, the configure of RasPiO and Johnny 5 is
pretty easy.

57
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,550
You just have to start it and acquire the
module in your JS file.

58
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:19,939
I'd never built something like that and my
knowledge on the subject was new.

59
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:29,280
All I know from movies that there are conventions
for connecting the wires.

60
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:40,819
So, all I wanted to do was not to burn my
house because it would be terrible.

61
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:50,220
So, after the setup of the Raspberry Pi, the
first thing I tried was to turn on tiny lights.

62
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,050
And to my surprise, it worked.

63
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,699
So thank you.

64
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:07,560
[ Applause ]
So, I got into the world of several motors

65
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,879
and I tried to make one work.

66
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,789
But that part wasn't that easy.

67
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:15,550
As I was suspecting.

68
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,949
So, the Raspberry Pi has a lot of pins to
put the wires.

69
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:25,350
But you can't use any.

70
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,120
I connected wires to different pins on the
server motor.

71
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,120
It didn't work until I found out that there
are some things that need to be connected

72
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,550
to a specific pin.

73
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,020
For example, controlling the server module
place.

74
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:53,370
So, to do that you need to connect to a PWN
which is a pulse with modulation pin.

75
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,699
And the Raspberry Pi has just four of them.

76
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:02,229
So, I connected to a wire.

77
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:03,990
GPO18.

78
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:15,069
And the other wires must be connected to a
5volt pin and a ground pin.

79
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:24,680
So, during the process I learned that not
all server modules are the same.

80
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,979
Some of them turn 45 degrees.

81
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:29,090
Others, 180 degrees.

82
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,909
And there's some with continuous rotation.

83
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:41,560
I used all of them until I found the one I
needed.

84
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,010
Okay.

85
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:54,090
You know that you must consider the weight
of what you want to move.

86
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,660
So, I had to try several modules for different
weights.

87
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,710
My house was full of servers.

88
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,380
But I chose the one that can receive 3.2 kilos.

89
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,380
So, I'm sorry.

90
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:17,520
[ Laughter ]
Yes, that was a problem.

91
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,279
Because I can't stop I can't make it stop
the server modules.

92
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:30,760
And so, the food overflowed a lot of times
all over the table.

93
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,829
That drove my cats crazy.

94
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:40,770
So, in fact, they heard the sound of the food
getting out of the feeder and came running

95
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,250
to me and started meowing and at first it
was very funny.

96
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,270
Okay.

97
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:55,139
But it turns out that to move a server motor
with continuous rotation, you need to move

98
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:56,570
the blade clockwise.

99
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:09,110
So, itâ€™s necessary to set the top speed
of the server blades when you want to stop.

100
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:17,070
So, I set the feeder to give them the food
twice a day.

101
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,209
For that I used an npm package.

102
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:25,480
You just have to set the minutes.

103
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,960
Every 15 minutes.

104
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,040
And then the hours.

105
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,180
That's it.

106
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:38,980
They eat at 8:15 and 9:15 p.m.

107
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:48,630
So, thanks to that, I left the pet feeder
running.

108
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:54,370
And thanks to that, I realized that the feeder
wasn't working properly because it was letting

109
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,029
out the food every hour.

110
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:03,250
So, they were crazy.

111
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,060
Yes.

112
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:12,360
They wanted to eat all the food they can see.

113
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,079
I'm sorry.

114
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:22,430
So, for I spent a lot of time trying to figure
out what was the problem.

115
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:31,230
And I found out that the library, the package
wasn't working properly.

116
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,329
So, I replaced that package for another one.

117
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:39,160
And everything was all right.

118
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,720
So, the feeder was almost done.

119
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,699
But one day my cats got up really, really
early.

120
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,420
Like 5 a.m.

121
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,510
And they started mewing loudly.

122
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,910
I was a little bit sleepy.

123
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,860
And tried to get up and fill their bowls.

124
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:06,120
But I knew that if I didn't get up, they would
keep crying.

125
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:15,089
And so, that was the point where I thought
that I should include a new feature.

126
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:25,570
Send an email from the comfort of my bed and
go back to sleep.

127
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:32,680
So, I started looking for other packages.

128
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:43,220
And by the time I felt like this little cat
sticking its nose in every package, his tongue.

129
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,280
Until I got the right one for this project.

130
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:57,380
So, to then develop this new feature, I found
this package that allows you to set up the

131
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,870
configuration.

132
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:04,430
It was very easy to include this package in
my project.

133
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:14,300
And in this case, I wanted the feeder to start
working only if I was the immediate sender.

134
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:21,470
So, this was the feeder before it became a
robot.

135
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,610
And after a lot of time developing and testing
yeah.

136
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:32,220
The feeder is called Sascha.

137
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,110
I finished it with this final structure.

138
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,130
That's awesome.

139
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:47,449
With the help of my friend because there are
a lot of things that I can't do.

140
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:51,410
So, we included those.

141
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:58,149
Before that it was just one tube.

142
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:08,060
I want to say this separation of those two
is made by was made by that.

143
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:22,320
So, I can say that the dream that I had when
I was a child came true.

144
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:48,139
[ Applause ]
So, I'm building Sascha and getting all these

145
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:54,589
made me know I wanted to do more projects
involving robotics.

146
00:14:54,589 --> 00:15:00,370
That there are a lot of potential use cases
of home automation that I would love to implement

147
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:08,870
like controlling nonsmart things like lights
or the airconditioner.

148
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,990
Or controlling the temperature of the room.

149
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:24,339
So, I think that it's you can build this feeder
just with a little JavaScript knowledge.

150
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,300
It's not too complicated.

151
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:34,529
And it's a nice activity to teach you how
to code.

152
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:41,019
Even if there are parts that involve not coding
like building the structure and gluing pieces,

153
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:49,880
et cetera, why is it a nice activity to code?

154
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:57,779
You can teach conditionals and setting up
packages and the microcontroller so you can

155
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:03,110
introducing beginners to the art of setting
up their computers.

156
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:17,959
I don't know much JavaScript because I started
learning to program like two years ago.

157
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:24,939
But I'm sure that there are amazing projects
to be built and to be shown.

158
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:32,889
Maybe those projects can inspire others other
people to the things to facilitate chores

159
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:40,850
or change how they interact with their home
just with a little bit of code.

160
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:49,200
So, that's all I have.
