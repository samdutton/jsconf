1
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,090

really be talking about small talk today

2
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,500
I hope nobody's disappointed but a lot

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,149
of what I'll be showing comes out of

4
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:45,790
that tradition and I thought it was

5
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,320
great some of the things that David

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,610
alluded to the among other things was

7
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,710
the allusion to self from which the

8
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,660
graphics model at this the morphic

9
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,129
graphics model that I'll be working with

10
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:02,260
came also John McCarthy's half-page Lisp

11
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,019
eval is just the perfect example of

12
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,680
meta-circular programming I think I'll

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,860
just start in though and and talk about

14
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,759
what I've called a live web and it's

15
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,410
based on a system called the lively

16
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,810
kernel that we've been working on for a

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,149
couple of years and a way of thinking of

18
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,240
it is what if you tried to do something

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,390
like squeak small talk in JavaScript and

20
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,090
for those of you who don't know some

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,440
squeak is a version of small talk that's

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,200
written in itself and the whole

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,539
environment is live all the time so

24
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:40,119
you're you're running in the environment

25
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:42,849
the debugger the editor all of it is

26
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:44,890
running live with you and that's sort of

27
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,810
a part of your compositional spirit and

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,099
I mean just and so to do that when I

29
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:57,869
first this was I guess when I was at Sun

30
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,849
it looked like the people I wasn't that

31
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,890
interested in Java at the time so the

32
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,929
people around me seemed to be having fun

33
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,270
doing web programming but when I looked

34
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,009
at it looked incredibly complicated you

35
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,150
know is HTML a text markup language PHP

36
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,150
CSS all this stuff that that didn't

37
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,569
connect with me for basic programming

38
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,680
and I thought why can't we just do

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,140
things like we did 30 years ago with a

40
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,060
dynamic language and graphics in the

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,510
browser

42
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,709
that's what became the lively kernel so

43
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,410
the basic idea is to is to provide a

44
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,040
component architecture in HTML with a

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,920
structured scene graph and the way we've

46
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,060
done it we've done various

47
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,580
implementations with HTML or SVG or

48
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,890
canvas graphics the one I'll be showing

49
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,980
is is just pretty much straight HTML

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,829
it runs in any browser and so there's no

51
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,720
download no installation it's really

52
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,579
simply a web page just a pile of

53
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:58,340
JavaScript it's a composition

54
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,430
environment in addition so it's got a

55
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,950
it's got a small GUI builder and its own

56
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,140
IDE none of the components are sort of

57
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,159
product level software

58
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,019
they've just designed to show that you

59
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,090
can put these things together and get

60
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,799
over that sort of creative hump and then

61
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,430
it's the small talk there was a model of

62
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,019
the image which was sort of the whole

63
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,329
world frozen in a file and we have the

64
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,430
same kind of approach except that we do

65
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,650
it on a web page so at any point in your

66
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,959
in your project you can just store it as

67
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,780
a web page the lively kernel has lots of

68
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,680
neat little kernel bits of software one

69
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,930
of them is web dev that lets you lets

70
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,579
you do that I would sit here oh let me

71
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:50,269
see I'm gonna just reload this whole

72
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:53,090
page I'm sorry because that's some stuff

73
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,340
we were doing before in this environment

74
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,519
it's really just a web page but you've

75
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,500
got the basic graphics and added to that

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,870
is just a little bit of a little bit of

77
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,400
code that lets you pick things up and

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
move them around you can make copies of

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,609
things and then as I said there are

80
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:13,250
small little bits of little bits of

81
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,169
editors here so that for instance you

82
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:23,419
can change the shape of things and then

83
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,530
you can if you drag you can just drag

84
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,909
and drop things one on top of another

85
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:33,800
like this and then that becomes a new

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,620
object and you can in it inherits all

87
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,240
the same properties of objects so you

88
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,990
can you can make copies and and

89
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,690
similarly you get the same they behave

90
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,460
they inherit all the other graphics

91
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,680
properties that are available and you

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,139
can there other shapes been added like

93
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,750
polygons and stuff and and there's also

94
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,070
a

95
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,260
a green thread scheduler that lets you

96
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,430
do dynamic behavior so for instance well

97
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,930
he was here's a polygon that you can

98
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,660
pick up and move around and if I take

99
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,170
this and this little halo is our user

100
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:17,000
interface tit that helps to it helps to

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,890
deal with the problem which you'll

102
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,750
encounter if you try to do a system like

103
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,940
this of both having developer support

104
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,240
and user support in there so that's a

105
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,430
way of bringing up our commands so

106
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,750
there's a little inspector lets you

107
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,550
inspect the properties of that polygon

108
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,740
and you can also write code in it so I

109
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:42,170
could say this start stepping every 50

110
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:51,020
milliseconds the rotate by method with a

111
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:58,220
parameter of 0.05 or something like that

112
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,010
and okay so now we've got a now we've

113
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,730
got a spinning star and you can pick

114
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,260
that up and move it around while it's

115
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,620
live you can make copies of it so you

116
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,080
can have a lot of fun with this stuff so

117
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,500
for instance I could take this and

118
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,870
reshape it that way and pick this guy up

119
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,570
and drop him on there so now I've got a

120
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,120
little sort of magic wand thing and I

121
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,579
can stick that on there you know

122
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:39,319
so so this is how it should be right we

123
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,370
shouldn't be surprised I mean

124
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,350
poor mathematicians you know for

125
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,650
centuries had to deal with with looking

126
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,440
at the outside world and abstracting it

127
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
and coming up with cool little theories

128
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,040
now we can write cool little programs

129
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,170
and they go out in world and make these

130
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,540
neat graphic things and music and all

131
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,750
that good stuff

132
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,950
okay so just moving right along if you

133
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,810
take those shapes and just add you know

134
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,250
a little bit more script you can build

135
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,930
up widgets in ways that you all know

136
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,170
well and I'll just show you a little bit

137
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:22,810
about this so in this environment I mean

138
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,690
I've got a clock that's built here make

139
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,720
it a little bit bigger and in addition

140
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,720
to an inspector you can also get a sort

141
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,540
of a more powerful interface on it and

142
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,320
so that's our module system loading in

143
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,010
something else so here we've got a

144
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,790
scripting browser looking at the clock

145
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,220
and you see here are the names of the

146
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,980
methods and every every object when you

147
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,020
drop it in this world gets sent the

148
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,760
message start stepping scripts that's

149
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,100
what I did to the ellipse to the that

150
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,230
star and and if you take a look at this

151
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,270
one it says start stepping every

152
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,950
thousand milliseconds to set hands

153
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,570
procedure so that must be how the clock

154
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,750
works so I can go and click on set hands

155
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,720
and yes indeed it gets the data object

156
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,390
and pulls out the second the minute in

157
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,060
the hour into variables and then sets

158
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,160
the rotation of the three polygons that

159
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,800
are the three hands here it's setting

160
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,840
the second hands rotation to be the

161
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,300
current second divided by sixty times

162
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,300
two pi so that make sense

163
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,219
but since the system's live I can go

164
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,169
here and type a minus here and and

165
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,690
accept that now we've got a clock that

166
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,930
runs backwards and and that's not to say

167
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,810
that a backwards clock is a useful thing

168
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,210
but by just to show you sort of how it's

169
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,740
all immediate and in the environment

170
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,750
itself so let's see and one of the cool

171
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,329
things about

172
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:59,449
this is if you build things this way you

173
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:04,439
know everything runs just fine transform

174
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:06,709
again people are laughing that's the way

175
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,839
it should be right and and you know all

176
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,670
the text selection still works and in

177
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,269
fact we can even go in here and fix the

178
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:17,360
bug we put in there and now we've got a

179
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:29,869
normal clock again okay so this is so so

180
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,999
this is a neat environment but it's it's

181
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:34,459
it's for people like you and me and not

182
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,319
for the rest of the world it's basically

183
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,540
a programming environment and so we

184
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,059
wanted to widen the community that could

185
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,009
work with this kind of stuff and I hope

186
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,769
to show you some apps that that can be

187
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:49,369
built easily and and some others that

188
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:53,480
are real programming but we figured that

189
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,549
a Java Script ID wasn't necessarily the

190
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,290
answer for end users what's something

191
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,269
that's sort of more concrete where you

192
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:00,980
can pull things together and drag and

193
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,549
drop them that kind of stuff and so I'm

194
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:06,079
going to show you that environment in

195
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,610
just a minute but what I'm going to do

196
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:13,160
is it's first escape out of this just so

197
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,319
that you get this it's kind of a cool

198
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:19,309
aspect to all of this so if you look

199
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:24,679
here whoops this whole thing that we

200
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,239
were doing that looked a little bit like

201
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:29,149
PowerPoint is just a web page and and

202
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:31,910
and that I was editing and so that

203
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,850
little presentation mode is simply is

204
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,709
simply a piece of the lively kernel

205
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:53,239
doing that okay okay yeah so so we came

206
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:56,779
up with this notion of a parts bin which

207
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,540
is a concrete repository in the cloud

208
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,720
and there can be a bunch of these of

209
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,259
objects made in the lively kernel that

210
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:08,089
have been serialized and that can be

211
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:09,080
downloaded

212
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:18,830
and let me see don't be alarmed so a lot

213
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,080
of this work goes on at the hustle

214
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,050
Plattner Institute in Germany because

215
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,269
that's where my first interns went and I

216
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,740
thought it was a good place to have an

217
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,100
open source repository and turns out to

218
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,290
be connected with sa P where I now work

219
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,180
but I didn't didn't know that was going

220
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,950
to happen so so you can here's an

221
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,649
example one so here's an elephant this

222
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:45,800
was sort of the the benchmark for

223
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,790
benchmark for our polygon testing and

224
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,130
and there are a bunch of other things

225
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,450
that I hope to come back to in a little

226
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,760
while but there's also actually useful

227
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,380
stuff here like input so here's a slider

228
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,829
and and then you can you can hook these

229
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:08,870
things up so if I if I go get the the

230
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,380
menu for this slider then I can ask to

231
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,110
connect and let me move that just a

232
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,420
second hold everything put it in a

233
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,520
better place

234
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,910
so if I connect its value up to the

235
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,260
elephant and it's oh let's see set scale

236
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,410
parameter then you know I have a

237
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,080
scalable elephant sowhat's sorry about

238
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:50,800
that and now once again that's not to

239
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,630
say that scalable elephants are a really

240
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,320
useful thing but it it gives you an idea

241
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,750
is sort of how you can work in this more

242
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,420
drag-and-drop kind of kind of paradigm

243
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,670
and I'm going to take a minute now and

244
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,330
run through what could be a fairly

245
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,490
serious application done from scratch

246
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,730
and so I'm going to start out with

247
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,670
there's some code here for getting at

248
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,520
the at the server there's this thing

249
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,950
called a command line which you can

250
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,210
think I was just being a terminal

251
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:30,480
program so I'll put that there and

252
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,980
there's the LS prompt let me see if

253
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,370
that's live yep okay so we're talking to

254
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,750
the server and that's because I was

255
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,760
already logged in good you need

256
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,100
privileges to do this obviously and you

257
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,579
can type more interesting things such as

258
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,120
I'm not a UNIX hacker but I know this

259
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:58,450
much MP stat and you can find out how

260
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,910
busy the processor is so something you

261
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,410
might want to do is to plot the the load

262
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,110
on the processor on your server and so

263
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,670
we'll go through what it takes to do

264
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,620
that let me come back to here and this

265
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,650
is I'm running on top of sources that

266
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,360
other people are changing right now I

267
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,960
sometimes but so let's go to

268
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,820
visualization so we have the proto biz

269
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,850
open source graphics library in here a

270
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,790
bunch of really neat views there I'm

271
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,990
it's going to take a really simple one

272
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,920
here that will do a graph and pull it

273
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,950
out and put it there for now and get

274
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:54,240
this out of the way just drag it down

275
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,400
there

276
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,820
drag that over there now what we'd like

277
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,510
to do is to do a similar thing over here

278
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,070
we'd like to hear the numbers that come

279
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,500
back from MP stat and over here on the

280
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,710
right is the is the idle time so if we

281
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,390
take one hundred minus that we'd have

282
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,340
the the actual processing time so go

283
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,460
here to this menu and say connect the

284
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,080
server result which is a string that's

285
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,980
coming back to this graph over here and

286
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,390
it's add data and render aspect that's

287
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,530
not going to work at all because we've

288
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,690
got a text string coming back and this

289
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,610
thing expects new new floating-point

290
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,420
numbers so what I can do is to go here

291
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,060
and and ask for the connections in the

292
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,060
connections we can do this is the one

293
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,550
that I just put in and I can edit a

294
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,150
convertor in it and put this up here you

295
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,080
can see that normally it just passes the

296
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,760
value straight through as you'd expect

297
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,400
and I've got a little little snippet of

298
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,770
code down here just to save us time and

299
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,410
if I put that in here and into the

300
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,689
converter

301
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,299
paste and I'll tell you what it's doing

302
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,790
is really quick it takes the incoming

303
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,519
text breaks it into lines takes the

304
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,569
third one and then ten tokenize is that

305
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:38,970
line and takes the last one and that's

306
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,549
the idle value and then it returns one

307
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:45,029
hundred minus that together with a patch

308
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:47,279
I had to put to get it working because

309
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,439
this is a German server and the decimal

310
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:54,839
points a comma okay so if we save that

311
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,489
now now it should be the case that if I

312
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:04,740
come down here and hit empty step see

313
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,449
it's now plotting those values okay but

314
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,819
we're not going yet so now we've

315
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,220
something else we've seen before here if

316
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,559
we go to demos remember that clock we

317
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,389
didn't show you by the way from a

318
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:26,459
previous demo you'll see the windmill

319
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,350
kind of thing I stored that down there

320
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:33,299
too so in the clock we could go to it

321
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:39,419
again and do a connect of its set hands

322
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:40,799
procedure right because that gets

323
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,350
executed every second and I'll plug it

324
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,730
in here in the the exact parameter which

325
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,320
is the thing that sends that string away

326
00:17:49,320 --> 00:18:04,760
to the server and then collapse this

327
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,140
okay so this is a somewhat nerdy example

328
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,550
but it's just I thought it would get the

329
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,110
point you know that you can make this

330
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,870
stuff be easy and I'm actually this

331
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,660
winds up chewing up a fair amount of CPU

332
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,580
so I'm going to close that guy for that

333
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,400
for the next for the next thing I'm

334
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,660
going to do so I'll show you one other

335
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,190
thing which I thought was cool that one

336
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,610
of the guys at HP I did which is done in

337
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,860
the same way with this just writing

338
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,010
little pieces and plugging them together

339
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,560
what he did was he wrote this this

340
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,930
little unit here which searches back

341
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,680
over the server log and then that gets

342
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,620
that goes to this command-line guy with

343
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,010
it and and essentially does say who is

344
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,570
and then that comes back with an IP that

345
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,230
goes to this excuse me then yeah we get

346
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,440
the IP and then that goes here to an

347
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,810
address extractor after the Whois and

348
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,880
then that gets fed into a Google Maps

349
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,530
and this is something you can do other

350
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,810
ways but this was done from scratch so

351
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,920
if I push search here oh and let me I've

352
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,900
also got a well you see it running there

353
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,470
and there it's it's put its put little

354
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,680
left little markers on the map

355
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,700
there's a bunch of them in Europe

356
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,020
because of course that's where the

357
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,730
center is in some of the US so I thought

358
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,610
that was pretty cool

359
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,290
just to show you I'll take you for a

360
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,680
little tour of the parts bin here some

361
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:51,049
of the more fun things

362
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:55,899
just get rid of that this is something I

363
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:59,289
was curious I really liked how a lot of

364
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:01,450
cool tutorial software was written years

365
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,460
ago and a system called HyperCard and

366
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,720
I've always wanted yep yep I've always

367
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,240
wanted to be able to do tutorials sort

368
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,330
of with this you know with some some

369
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,549
teaching and some graphics and and

370
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,429
wanted to do a tutorial about aircraft

371
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:21,700
engines so this is one that with this

372
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,710
this is a demonstration that shows that

373
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,620
you can't make an even running 4 cycle

374
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,710
engine with an even number of cylinders

375
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,630
done as a radial engine so this one

376
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,580
obviously would not be smooth because

377
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,740
it's firing all of them and then doing

378
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,409
nothing for the next next rotation and

379
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:39,760
you think that if you just made them

380
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,669
alternate that that would work out but

381
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:45,070
it doesn't because it's 4 cycle and it

382
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,779
doesn't work that way so you actually

383
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,110
have to go to an odd number of cylinders

384
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,360
and there you can see the familiar five

385
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,620
pointed star as it goes around smoothly

386
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,500
so I'll put it back to three-year just

387
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,510
to make things easy so I thought that

388
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,770
was pretty cool there's a kind of thing

389
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,809
you'd expect needed flash and it's it's

390
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,399
just the lively kernel with you know

391
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:12,399
three three or five rotations of the the

392
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:19,360
same graphic simulation let's see so

393
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,370
we've got other things here's a here's

394
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,740
little Chinese checkers program this is

395
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,289
that this is a fun one for doing

396
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:33,789
collaboration because because if you

397
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:36,010
just make multiple copies of this you

398
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,850
can you can play a game so here's

399
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,520
something where if you start and you

400
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,899
just you know so if I make a move like

401
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:50,140
this and the computer makes its move and

402
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,250
I can move there and you know and so on

403
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,020
if I move up here and then it figures

404
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,360
that out that's it okay so you've got

405
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,159
the makings of a game and you can make a

406
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,139
bunch of humans or you can turn this one

407
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:03,370
into the computer

408
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:07,210
and and it will sit there playing away

409
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,090
at itself while the engines running and

410
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,500
all that good stuff and and another fun

411
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,240
thing is we have a lot of fun with this

412
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,810
is this is just actually just a simple

413
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,420
graphic here our old friend the Mona

414
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,820
Lisa and you can also this is a little

415
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:40,960
bit profane but yeah get this out of the

416
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:53,650
way thank you if you're bored you've got

417
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,360
somebody to be with while you're

418
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,630
programming late at night and then

419
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,820
something that I wanted to do for ages

420
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,890
let me pull out the component first to

421
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,870
show you a long time ago in small talk I

422
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,570
had done a keyboard and we built a MIDI

423
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,140
synthesizer for it and everything and

424
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,330
and so when I got the lively kernel

425
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,430
working then I put this keyboard out as

426
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,490
it's a really neat it's like less than

427
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,050
half a page to do the whole layout and

428
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,690
all that stuff but it didn't make music

429
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,970
and I thought that would tempt people on

430
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,350
our on our list to actually make it work

431
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,700
nothing came back the best thing that

432
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,790
came back was an array of 88 URLs to

433
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:46,330
OneNote MIDI you know does not do the

434
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,090
job so I've been waiting and waiting for

435
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,160
for the world wide web to finally get

436
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,420
some standards out there there are

437
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,130
finally some standards and then I ran

438
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,420
across a neat piece of JavaScript that

439
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,040
the that handles all all all the current

440
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,810
browsers pretty well so that got me

441
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,720
motivated and I remembered the the

442
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,120
simplest possible way to do a to do

443
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,190
music synthesis is called the car plus

444
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,970
algorithm

445
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,980
don't know if any of you know it but

446
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,080
basically you just you load up a buffer

447
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,630
with white noise random numbers and then

448
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,240
you play it but as you play it you

449
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,090
average adjacent samples and the net

450
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,640
effect is that it does a low-pass filter

451
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,230
so the high harmonics start to die out

452
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,570
and you're left with just a regular note

453
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:42,520
and so okay it sounds like a plucked

454
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,460
string and that's all it's doing and I

455
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,240
can prove it by showing you so here's

456
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,220
more stuff that's running in the lively

457
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,890
kernel so there's a complete browser

458
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,440
which does a parse of the kind of

459
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,330
JavaScript files you would work with any

460
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,630
clips and presents them as classes and

461
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,460
this is looking at the pluck sound class

462
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,500
and then these are all the methods that

463
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,490
are needed for that and this is the the

464
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,280
method for mixing samples into the

465
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,350
actual sound buffer and you see a for

466
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,050
loop there and basically it interpolates

467
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,320
a sample averages the two samples and

468
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,030
then spits them out to the left and

469
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,960
right output so that's how that works

470
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:34,150
and you can I mean you can actually play

471
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:42,360
a few there absolute a minute

472
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,780
just a second I'm gonna restart that

473
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,390
there's I think we wound up getting a

474
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,750
long sound buffer here yes if there's a

475
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,740
delay in here which is too bad but

476
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,690
you'll get to hear the audio and this is

477
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,460
usually there right in sync and to a

478
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,770
certain extent you could actually pick

479
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,430
up you can actually be doing things in

480
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,480
the graphics side of this as well every

481
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,040
once in a while is this you miss a

482
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:24,230
sample by doing that

483
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,820
it's and you can actually you know this

484
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:45,610
stuff all really works
