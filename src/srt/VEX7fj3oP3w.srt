hi I'm Juan I'm from Buenos Aires Xena

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,450
this here my whole life and I'm a

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,340
JavaScript developer I've been working

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,710
with well for the last 10 years probably

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,369
and I've recently joined yahoo a year

6
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,100
ago I've been part of the why I

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,910
community for a long time and I was

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,640
grateful to join the team there I'm kind

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,379
of sad to see it go in the last couple

10
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,180
of months but we're working on some new

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,610
siding projects justices from a DSS I

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,550
presented today under stuff around es6

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,000
and no tears applications ok so I'm am

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,089
pure JavaScript developer I actually

15
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:56,150
started doing some other stuff like PHP

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,680
and working with games but I eventually

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,530
specialized a lot in JavaScript I do

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,120
mostly big web big front end

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,960
applications and no Jas and I've slowly

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,700
become some sort of you know lawyer on

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,880
specifications and I'm hoping to get

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,850
involved with 279 and all the standards

23
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,240
process Jasper well i think i think we

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,120
stuck up a couple of you know hints at

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,570
where we're going with the web already

26
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,000
with such as in mr. dibbs presentation i

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,250
think we're going to see even more and

28
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,200
more intuition with childhood anywhere I

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,510
mean there was is talk like a stock

30
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,630
called the birth and death of java

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,140
script was written in which a guy told

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,940
the history of javascript and the future

33
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,480
of it in some sort of a fictional way

34
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,400
but eventually in this fiction just keep

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,740
ended up everywhere even in processors

36
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,370
and i think it's kind of a joke but

37
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,860
we're seeing that javascript is kind of

38
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,009
permeating everywhere from hardware to

39
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,970
robots to

40
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,660
built our reality so I think the web

41
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,930
will keep being this thing that connects

42
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,480
us all and at the core of it will be the

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,870
web platform things that we working on

44
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,780
today my talk was about

45
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,160
internationalization and you know it's

46
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,680
one of the core things in the web that

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,780
you don't think about you all the time

48
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,520
you're used to dealing with one or two

49
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,260
languages in our case like Spanish in

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,330
English but the web actually reach these

51
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,160
people in Africa in the east in our

52
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,660
countries that I speak Arabic countries

53
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,130
speak Chinese or Japanese and dealing

54
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,290
with language it could be kind of

55
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,270
complicated so we're working on things

56
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,450
that try to simplify I really happened

57
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,360
to be here being a you know one of the

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,790
things that you think oh maybe I could

59
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,920
give a talk or not but I'm really

60
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,130
impressed and I'm really happy to see a

61
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,860
really great audience that come here to

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,680
learn with a an open mind and I think

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,940
that's something you don't see every day
