1
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,720

and we're a non-profit tax-exempt our

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,000
focus is developing and adapting

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,550
technology so that all sorts of

4
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,189
different kinds of learners learners in

5
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,379
k-12 learners and university and

6
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:36,809
learners and makers in informal

7
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,820
education or just people who want to

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,870
investigate things can do a lot more

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,460
investigation inquiry experimentation

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,949
collaboration and communication sort of

11
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:48,390
in science and technology and

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,839
engineering what i'm here to show you

13
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:53,400
today is the framework that we've been

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,769
working on about a year and a half ago

15
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:57,030
we got a grant from the google

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,460
foundation to take a lot of the work

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,309
that we had done in java and redevelop

18
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,199
it to work in a browser we've been

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,700
wanting to move in that direction for a

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,310
while but the great deal of our funding

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,260
comes from National Science Foundation

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,360
grants and they're interested in

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,729
research and we develop technology with

24
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,080
those grants but it's very hard to

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,080
actually make it robust and useful so

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,420
I'm talking about something I needed to

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,009
pick a short name because I was going to

28
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,049
type it a lot so the project is called

29
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,329
lab and we're doing basically

30
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,969
html5-based scientific modelling

31
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,109
visualization graphing and probe where

32
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:36,090
this presentation is up in a github

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,450
repository so you can find it later the

34
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,009
slide at the end will show you where

35
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,659
that is we've designed the framework to

36
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,189
support multiple different kinds of

37
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,319
modeling engines some and I'm using the

38
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,069
word modeling a little bit widely the

39
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:55,409
biggest one the one with the most number

40
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,990
of features we call em d 2 d it's a

41
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,869
translation of a java application called

42
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,789
molecular workbench that does a lot of

43
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,280
2d molecular modeling there are some

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,000
other model types in progress one is for

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,039
a solar system and we're going to be

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,660
having some simple climate models in

47
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,270
there another is a signal generator and

48
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,870
another is for working with probe where

49
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,870
so I did not adjust this for the size of

50
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,709
the screen this is a a model that runs

51
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,360
it's basically a two-dimensional

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,840
simulation of

53
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,840
is it interesting I'm not getting it

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:44,580
running so we are going to quickly

55
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,110
we'll go to the production site and run

56
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:58,629
it there so there's a lot of calculation

57
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:01,090
going on here there are two different

58
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,599
kinds of two-dimensional molecules these

59
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,390
are uncharged these are charged we were

60
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,670
calculating the lennard-jones attraction

61
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,440
between all of these for all of them

62
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,690
those are relatively short range we're

63
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,569
also calculating the attraction due to

64
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,190
the Coulomb forces which are charged

65
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,680
forces those are longer range the way

66
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,200
this works is you're generally going to

67
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
see clumping among these molecules and

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,739
clumping among those and they don't mix

69
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,049
very well and if you mix them they will

70
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,530
um you know they will end up separating

71
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:43,959
again so i'm going to move through this

72
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,360
is in the presentation and it'll make

73
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,889
sure it's working there later embeddable

74
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,400
so this is a basically a relatively

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,389
simple model where we can adjust the we

76
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,819
can play God we can adjust the van der

77
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,220
Waals attraction we adjust it strongly

78
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,530
it forms sort of a hexagon zagging will

79
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,569
shape we loosen it and they start moving

80
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,290
all over we can change the temperature

81
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,450
and up one of the things that you could

82
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,900
pretty easily experiment with this is if

83
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,200
we change the temperature to here and we

84
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,169
turn on charge well you can take a look

85
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,180
at how hot do we have to get this to get

86
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,870
the molecules to move from a solid state

87
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,820
to a liquid state so I'm going to

88
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:40,840
increase the temperature here and what

89
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,880
would you call it it's sort of moving to

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,770
the liquid state there well that's

91
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,090
probably a liquid state we have to get

92
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,150
quite hot well if we're not using the

93
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,270
molecules aren't polarized and we'll

94
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,890
leave the van der Waals attraction the

95
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,900
same lower the temperature well that's

96
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,360
obviously a solid

97
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,669
let's make a little hotter a little

98
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:02,849
hotter we're moving into a liquid domain

99
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:10,770
at a much lower temperature see we've

100
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,979
got different kinds of even in the

101
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,099
molecular 2d dynamics we've got

102
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,199
something for investigating protein

103
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,449
folding and we can set up different

104
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,400
kinds of proteins now it's not real

105
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,139
protein folding but we actually are

106
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,810
doing a lot of modeling here to figure

107
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,120
out what lines up with what and here

108
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,069
you've got a collection of hydrophobic

109
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,199
and hydrophilic and things we could

110
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,229
change the solvent type will change it

111
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,870
to oil and when there's going to be a

112
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,460
different kind of attraction a different

113
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,139
kind of rearrangement of what's on the

114
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:51,060
inside and what's on the outside I'm

115
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:58,710
gonna one of the things so here we got

116
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:05,219
that one one of the things we can also

117
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:08,250
do with the molecular dynamics engine is

118
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,860
actually use macroscopic units this

119
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,960
particular model and again and having

120
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,719
trouble getting it working one of the

121
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:20,400
things in any of these models when

122
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,379
they're embedded you can actually click

123
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:23,729
the share link and you're going to get

124
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,199
the iframe code actually that's not

125
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,080
going to work so I'll just click on this

126
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,159
link which gives me the embeddable code

127
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,009
the embeddable zar designed these

128
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:39,680
Interactive's they're designed to

129
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,210
fluidly scale to whatever container you

130
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,699
put them in so obviously at some point

131
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,639
it's going to get too small to read but

132
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,360
we can see it here when we run this one

133
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,370
we're instead of using the units in the

134
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,319
molecular dynamics 2d where which would

135
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,469
be femtoseconds and nanometers or using

136
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:03,150
MKS units and this is a for the

137
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,310
molecular dynamics engine this is a very

138
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,409
simple model it's a pendulum and a

139
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,659
spring so it's a springy pendulum and

140
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,190
you can see all sorts of strange things

141
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,050
we can change the rod length in

142
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,810
centimeters and run that again we could

143
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,850
change gravity we could change the mass

144
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,680
of the ball the spring constant we can

145
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,850
do all of those things to do

146
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,550
investigations these graphs over here

147
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,710
are standard part of what we call

148
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,330
Interactive's which we'll be talking a

149
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,500
little I'll talk a little bit more

150
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,340
everything is sort of very nicely

151
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,710
scalable so since I don't know why it's

152
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,690
not running here but tends to move

153
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,830
forward that was the protein folding one

154
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:49,100
let's just we've also got one which is

155
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,410
modeling DNA transcription and

156
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,650
translation so this is combining some

157
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,560
animation steps with actually some

158
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,300
modeling steps also all of this code is

159
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,880
open source under attribution only

160
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,890
licenses so it's there for anybody to

161
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:21,380
use

162
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,120
and so on and so on the engine

163
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,550
underneath this can use all sorts of

164
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,480
different forms of these kinds of models

165
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,160
moving to another one this is one that

166
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,250
we've just started working on its

167
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,200
quantum collision the 2d molecular

168
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,260
dynamics model was not dealing with the

169
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,560
energy associated with an atom when the

170
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,140
electrons are moving from state to state

171
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,820
so this is the beginning of that we

172
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,430
start this model like that and nothing

173
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,320
special is happening let me change it

174
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,270
reset it back to the beginning I'm going

175
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,560
to change the starting velocity and

176
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,640
right now we're moving back and forth

177
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,860
and there's energy changes one of the

178
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,060
things you can do is you can run the

179
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,220
model backwards and forwards you can see

180
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,400
the graph is going backwards and we can

181
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,720
examine different points that's

182
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,480
available in all the models so here's

183
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,280
another model and the new quantum

184
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,050
dynamics plug in this is going to allow

185
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,170
us to actually we're starting to

186
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:39,450
visualize photons leaving this is one is

187
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,690
also an early development this is for to

188
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,280
help kids understand about seasons it's

189
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,810
just the beginning but it's using a

190
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,790
similar particle type engine but it's a

191
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:56,850
different model type and basically it

192
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,460
says particles with mass and

193
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,350
gravitational field and we're going to

194
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,240
be adding a climate a simple latitude

195
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,580
based climate model to that so kids can

196
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,520
investigate basically at different kinds

197
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,980
of tilt in different kinds of orbits one

198
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,950
of the things you can do here is you can

199
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,930
let's change it back to will change it

200
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,010
to an oblique orbit one of the things we

201
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,380
wanted kids to do is to investigate what

202
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,610
is the relationship of tilt of the

203
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,830
planet two seasons and how does that

204
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,050
relate to how far away we are from the

205
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,850
Sun and the northern hemisphere were

206
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,880
closer to the Sun in the winter most

207
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
kids would think we're further

208
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,589
because it's quite reasonable to think

209
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:37,360
it's warmer because we're closer to the

210
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,140
Sun so here's a simple model where earth

211
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:48,010
goes farther away so i'm not going to

212
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,290
signal generator model type was a way of

213
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,660
generating streaming data but it was

214
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,750
really designed to support this model

215
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,550
type which works with sensors I've got a

216
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,560
commercial device here from a company

217
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,250
named premier Adam right now the

218
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,870
connection to this is with an invisible

219
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,740
Java applet via the software from

220
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,680
vernier their sdk is completely public

221
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,640
domain so while getting things to work

222
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,860
with java applets and maintaining java

223
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,810
applets is quite difficult Richard would

224
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,120
you come up and help bring your computer

225
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,160
too because I'm going to be changing to

226
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,050
talk over to you so this is an

227
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,839
ultrasonic sensor i just plugged it in

228
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:36,100
and started out the browser it's a

229
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,200
browser which has java applets enabled

230
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,790
and it's all we know it's getting harder

231
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,160
and harder to maintain like security

232
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,890
with java applets but see can we start

233
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,300
this and we don't seem to be getting the

234
00:11:52,300 --> 00:12:03,430
java applet working hold on yes so one

235
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,899
of the things i will mention so

236
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,940
yesterday in the node BOTS workshop I

237
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,520
did probably the smallest node bought

238
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,680
there that there's really not much here

239
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,779
I called a little bot but what I did was

240
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:16,300
turn this Arduino into something it it

241
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,120
turned itself into a joystick and I had

242
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,839
some simple pot and linear some analog

243
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,300
inputs and once I did turn it into a

244
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,339
joystick I could get data in using the

245
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,920
gamepad API so I'd really like to have

246
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,390
all sorts of people be able to measure

247
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,640
things more easily and if you can turn

248
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,040
arduino 'he's into sensing devices and

249
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,170
hang them pretend to be a gamepad you

250
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,510
can get analog data into your computer

251
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,180
into your browser without any extensions

252
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,019
or or any java

253
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,089
so I'm not sure why that's not working

254
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,749
one of the things i would do really

255
00:12:51,749 --> 00:13:01,040
quickly let's quit that

256
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,940
I reloaded the page once more

257
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,790
okay so i actually it I think I know

258
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,680
what the problem is I'm going to do it

259
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,680
quick going to the development site i

260
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,110
think i forgot to rebuild the java

261
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:36,740
resources on the production site

262
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,350
yes it's downloading now okay so i

263
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,510
should be able to run it so Richards

264
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,400
moving further away I'm getting distance

265
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,220
data and I'm of course with a sonar

266
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,390
Ranger we have that kind of a thing but

267
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,100
we can get all sorts of data now we're

268
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,990
it's going to timeout because it only

269
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,960
goes to about 10 meters but we're

270
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:08,820
getting that data over here so you can

271
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,160
find this presentation later online on

272
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:18,630
my github account steven eb github.com /

273
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,960
steven eb you'll find Jas comp 2013

274
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,910
that's the part of the name and you can

275
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,640
find this all later i'm going to show

276
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:35,880
you just a bit about what do I mean by

277
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,250
an interactive so one of the things some

278
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,940
when we're developing models like this

279
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,600
it's different than the form that's

280
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,670
often used in many web applications

281
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,610
we've got this particular model here

282
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,310
we've got a set of JSON for defining how

283
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,190
it works it's referring to a model it's

284
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,040
referring to various components this

285
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,630
particular one has very simple it just

286
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,940
has a button component at a very simple

287
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,170
layout I'm going to jump to something

288
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,280
which has a more complex system here so

289
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,050
this was that pendulum inter actually

290
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,700
it's just a pendulum on not the springy

291
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,470
pendulum I'm going to go down to the

292
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,110
interactive and show you so I'm still

293
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,839
referencing a model I'm also saying

294
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,460
there's some options for the model I'm

295
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,339
changing the unit scheme to MKS and I'm

296
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,110
sending what the time step / stick is

297
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,390
I'm deciding what's going to happen on

298
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,730
load I'm going to reset various things

299
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,290
and I'm doing things like resetting an

300
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,760
angle well what's unusual here is weird

301
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,310
of synthesizing outputs and parameters

302
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,800
for this so in the molecular model there

303
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,490
isn't any

304
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,589
output called current angle but we're

305
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:54,360
synthesizing it we can then use that

306
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,720
later in our components so we have a

307
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,180
slider which is attached to the property

308
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,380
you know gravity but here let's just

309
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,350
take a look so we got a graph component

310
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,910
here and we're basically saying the

311
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,740
property we're graphing is current angle

312
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,610
so there's a lot of headroom in this

313
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,149
kind of architecture for developing

314
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:23,430
various kinds of ways that things are

315
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,980
wired up so when we look at this and one

316
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:35,130
of the edible own this is a molecular

317
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,529
model but we're running it in a MKS unit

318
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,899
system these components are all

319
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,370
listening to properties and our

320
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,880
modifying properties of the model the

321
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,950
properties are also being sent to the

322
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,660
graph these are synthesized properties

323
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,480
when we run them I'm going to let

324
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,980
Richard plug in for a bit because he's

325
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,680
got a short presentation on how these

326
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,850
kinds of property the modeling is

327
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,760
different grab that I will pick up this

328
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:14,370
computer go while he's getting onto the

329
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,780
screen I'm going to mention one other

330
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,179
thing you should have this that we

331
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:32,900
wanted to show if we have time

332
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:51,039
ok so i like to say we sorry

333
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,259
so I'd like to say we allow these

334
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:56,090
Interactive's to let students sort of

335
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,950
fork and really anyone really learning

336
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,629
something sort of fork history and

337
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:02,029
that's a model and so there's actually

338
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:04,190
we took a bunch of inspiration from

339
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,559
JavaScript MVC frameworks that exist in

340
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,909
a slightly different domain for thinking

341
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:09,739
about how to do that so Steven talked

342
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:14,119
about this um this pendulum interactive

343
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,159
which is actually pretty cool because we

344
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,450
have all these different things you can

345
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,090
explore to see what happens no what if i

346
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,320
change the links does that change the

347
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,379
period of the of the pendulum or not and

348
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:26,450
i can try to find out for myself well if

349
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,609
i go back in time and I've played with

350
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,070
the parameters a little bit and as well

351
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,899
I can play God I can adjust the gravity

352
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:34,399
makes a gravity bigger see if that

353
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:41,799
affects a period oh maybe it doesn't and

354
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,509
but I may want to go back in time back

355
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:47,989
where i was before gravity changed see

356
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:49,669
the old parameters that i had and then

357
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:52,730
adjust pick some other one and adjust it

358
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,679
and so we think of that as sort of

359
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:57,879
forking the history of this this model

360
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:02,269
and in order to do that we took a bit of

361
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:03,980
inspiration from MVC frameworks this is

362
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,869
your sort of canonical example from like

363
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:08,059
ember which is you know this says okay

364
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,830
here's my something object which has a

365
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,139
full name property and you know i have

366
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:13,519
two other properties called first name

367
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,320
and last name that are real properties

368
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,749
on this model and I want my UI to update

369
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:20,090
when you know the first name changes I

370
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,379
want the full name to update and I want

371
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,059
the UI to automatically update and so

372
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:24,289
that's what that handlebars template is

373
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,659
doing well okay fine well we don't

374
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:28,429
exactly care like about your name or how

375
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:30,049
many followers you have I mean those are

376
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:31,850
great things but we really care about

377
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,009
like physics and time and we have these

378
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,679
um we have these need Interactive's that

379
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,440
have these these properties that are

380
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,759
associated with the model and we want

381
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,320
the UI to update automatically with

382
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,029
those as well so in order to do that we

383
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:49,639
use this property system I'm talking

384
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:53,299
about so we have we have automatic do I

385
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,009
binding is a more difficult problem in

386
00:19:55,009 --> 00:20:00,429
this case so here's an example i have a

387
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:03,559
gravitational field technically by the

388
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:04,490
way if you're too actually

389
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,990
work this out the physics this is like

390
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,370
the gravitational field on a neutron

391
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,650
star because it doesn't pull down

392
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,800
molecules like that fast but I want to

393
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,990
update the potential energy as the

394
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,270
things move around okay fine but the

395
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,330
potential energy is actually like the

396
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,640
energy between every two of those things

397
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,980
in the model and the interaction of each

398
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,809
like object in the model with the

399
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,070
gravitational fields it's a whole bunch

400
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,240
of computation that has to happen to

401
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,670
update that well what's actually need is

402
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,190
if I update the gravitational field

403
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,760
value even while the model is running

404
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,040
the potential energy is automatically

405
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:47,450
updated and so how do we do that and so

406
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,400
whatever method we use and this is sort

407
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,570
of how you would do it programmatically

408
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,880
bump up the bump up the gravitational

409
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,470
field we have to immediately update the

410
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,760
potential energy but there's no easy way

411
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,160
to say what is what is the relationship

412
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,630
between the output and the input we

413
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,800
actually have to recompute a whole bunch

414
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,350
of stuff so in order to do that we have

415
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,510
this concept called invalidation so if

416
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,570
we think about it in a sort of

417
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,830
programmatic way of doing some of the

418
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,570
stuff I was just showing you is we could

419
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,130
step the model forward 100 steps it's

420
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,130
like 100 ticks or 100 animation frames

421
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,110
and we can seek back to 50 well what

422
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,860
will happen is we'll update the we'll

423
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,840
update the UI using like saved state

424
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,460
because we're actually like saving like

425
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,080
a tape recorder of everything that

426
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,670
happened in the past then we can step

427
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,650
forward now we're on step 51 well okay

428
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,179
all we need to do is like replay the

429
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:36,860
stuff that saved in history but now

430
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,030
let's say we change the gravitational

431
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,220
field to twice what it was well now step

432
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,920
52 is got to be different then step 52

433
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,530
was before so we have to know that we

434
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,809
have to we can't just retrieve it from

435
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,309
memory we got to recalculate everything

436
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,050
so we have this concept of the

437
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,130
invalidation event and what's pretty

438
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,770
neat about that is that's a really

439
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,630
general way of thinking about how to

440
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,520
update mbc type properties so any change

441
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,410
to a model property invalidates it

442
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,910
forces recalculation of all the

443
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,950
properties and since we just you're just

444
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,360
in a physics model you just can't

445
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,550
predict what all the relationships will

446
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,919
be it triggers notification so you have

447
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,539
nice UI binding

448
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,249
and as we just saw it sort of is smart

449
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:20,899
enough to discard the future history

450
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:25,549
that you are no longer going to see we

451
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,139
have this idea of moving in time which

452
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,359
is which is kind of fundamental to these

453
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,619
models and something I think that's

454
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,720
interestingly different from a sort of

455
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,369
standard web app so you can they

456
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,529
progress in time and so when you move on

457
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:38,090
in time we sort of assume everything is

458
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,559
going to change so we just notify

459
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,580
everything and the last thing is this

460
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,799
these properties give you this neat idea

461
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,710
of parameters so parameters is soon UI

462
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,399
stuff you saw me manipulating in the in

463
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:54,200
the pendulum demo their properties too

464
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,090
and they just all they do is trigger an

465
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,279
action it can be a real ugly action to

466
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,869
make the model state somehow like match

467
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:03,109
their value like by updating the

468
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:04,879
gravitational field it'll make things

469
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,739
act as if the gravitational field this

470
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:15,679
is larger and so here's a really simple

471
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,840
model it's showing like this piston is

472
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,940
pushing in and these these molecules are

473
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,379
bouncing around well what if i add a

474
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:23,479
whole bunch of atoms i can just move

475
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,609
that slider and suddenly any ugly old

476
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,169
color i want that makes more atoms show

477
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:30,830
up we'll make actually make more answer

478
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,539
up and you'll see you'll bump up the

479
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:34,549
volume of the thing well if I go back in

480
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:38,599
time or if i do that i just took away a

481
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,919
whole bunch of atoms but let's say i

482
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,229
move backwards well i got on my a nose

483
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:47,149
back and I can play forward what I did

484
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:49,159
so if I actually really liked having 60

485
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,149
items and something really interesting

486
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:52,129
what's happening here I could I could

487
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:56,720
show that and so I just think it's a

488
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,179
neat a different way of thinking about

489
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,940
what web app properties are like and I

490
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,590
think it may have some applicability to

491
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,659
sort of games and simulations and a lot

492
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:07,309
of applications will see for javascript

493
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,979
in the future anyway that's it can you

494
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:11,080
bring up energy

495
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,539
so I was at the google Summer of Code

496
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:17,330
mentors conference last fall and I was

497
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,150
talking about some of this stuff and

498
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,230
these were people who came to a

499
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,539
presentation on how he can do very fast

500
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:25,190
computational simulation in the browser

501
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,740
and I realized after I showed them some

502
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,690
of this stuff and I told them what I was

503
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,400
doing almost half of them didn't

504
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,890
actually get what I was saying they

505
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,570
still thought it was happening in some

506
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,360
extension or plug-in or Java because

507
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,250
they really didn't understand how fast

508
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,130
you can do things in a browser there's

509
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,630
lots of great performance in a browser

510
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,610
I'm right now going to be showing

511
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,830
something here I'll just pick my

512
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,510
favorite one this is different this is

513
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,610
not yet internet connected SI as an

514
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,710
interactive but it is a model we want to

515
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,070
this is a fluid dynamics model we've got

516
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,590
a hundred by hundred cells here we're

517
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,380
doing convection conduction in a simple

518
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,760
form of radiation there's no radiation

519
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,280
in this model this is showing velocity

520
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,380
one velocity to velocity five and

521
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,659
velocity ten that what you're seeing

522
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:16,429
down here as turbulence is really the

523
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:18,140
tribulus associated with the kinematic

524
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,730
viscosity changes at the different

525
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,240
velocities there's a lot of calculation

526
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,159
going on in there we don't have time to

527
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:26,990
show it but last summer at the end of

528
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,510
the google Summer of Code work I was

529
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,020
doing with Pio Janek here e implemented

530
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,299
the physics solvers in here in WebGL we

531
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:36,919
were seeing speedups between four and

532
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,940
twenty times so if anyone has been doing

533
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,409
scientific computation this is all

534
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:44,179
happening right now in javascript in the

535
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,850
browser I just wanted to want everyone

536
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,940
to be inspired about what you could do

537
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,080
actually with this kind of scientific

538
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,210
processing this kind of capacity so

539
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,650
we're probably about one minute left

540
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,419
maybe there's some questions while we

541
00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:04,289
pull off our computers any questions

542
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:10,340
what sort of what well this particular

543
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,770
one it's basic fluid dynamics its

544
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,340
relative that's why it was easy to

545
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,600
relatively easy to port into WebGL

546
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,860
because it can work in a sort of a

547
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,280
parallel fashion the if you go to lab

548
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,150
concord org there's a

549
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,800
section on energy to D and there's a

550
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,240
whole bunch of stuff with a pointer to

551
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,250
an article in our newsletter by p 0

552
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,460
about how he did the WebGL conversion

553
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,760
but all the code is there there's

554
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,620
there's a developer email list so you

555
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,570
know if you go to lab concord org you'll

556
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,310
find links to the repository links to

557
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,320
the developer email list and I'd be glad

558
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,710
to follow up if anyone's interested I

559
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,330
think that's probably the end of our

560
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,220
time if people have more questions I'm

561
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,830
Steve and banish Richard clan sir find

562
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,310
us milling around and talk to us we'd

563
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,110
love to have anybody add more model

564
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,480
types work with you to make this work

565
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,940
for more frameworks or more models thank
