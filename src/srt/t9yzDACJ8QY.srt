00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,460

hello my name is sarah i'm from new york

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,470
city I'm a JavaScript developer

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,080
i'm the CEO of Julie back I'm from New

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,900
York City right now I live in San

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,090
Francisco them I studied computer

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,119
science and at Penn State University and

7
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,060
I've been building software for 13 years

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,390
so my talk was about going from working

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,500
with javascript in in hardware learning

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,930
more about hardware through JavaScript

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,510
and then taking that and doing working

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,010
on hard work full time and building a

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,079
hardware startup yeah so I've been a

14
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,400
huge JavaScript man for a long time I

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,769
started working in JavaScript about the

16
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:55,239
same time I started working in startups

17
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,610
I really like JavaScript for many

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,250
different reasons but because it's both

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,650
a server-side and client-side language

20
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,440
that's really neat I really

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,690
enjoy making the web faster and

22
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,780
JavaScript has a lot to do with that I

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,710
enjoy working on large scale projects

24
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,300
and one thing you really appreciate

25
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,520
about javascript is that if you work in

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,290
the web no matter what back in language

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,660
you're you're using you need to have

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,370
JavaScript on your website you can't

29
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,070
really get away with it without having

30
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,380
it so I think that really makes it

31
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,360
something super important to the

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,900
Internet in general oh I think that it's

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,910
been really exciting to see JavaScript

34
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,620
and hardware take off after the last

35
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,040
couple years I think we're seeing a real

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,310
revolution in hardware I think that

37
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,260
things like Arduino and 3d printing

38
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,140
makes it really accessible to build your

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,080
own products at home I think that we'll

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,880
see in the next couple years we'll see a

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,000
lot more people turning to hardware and

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,550
I think that javascript is a great way

43
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,979
to get started into it and my hopes are

44
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:09,910
that JavaScript and node box and

45
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,300
JavaScript enabled hardware will birth a

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,340
lot more hardware company

47
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,519
so this is a gorgeous City it's winter

48
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,519

49
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,280

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,560
