1
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,879

so I'm here to talk to you about

2
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:18,230
creating custom modules using Yui on how

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,470
to once we have it how to submit it to

4
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,810
the Yui gallery so yui so this is a Yui

5
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:33,440
3 this is the our new Yui instance and

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,600
it's pretty much everything that we need

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,199
in order to get going with Yui 3 it's a

8
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:41,030
self-contained function that it will

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,730
return soon instance of the why up dude

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,140
and it will provide like ass unboxing

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,039
for us to where we can start building

12
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,489
our modules it's a sign this way so you

13
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,710
can have multiple why you are instances

14
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,769
in the same page and your guarantee that

15
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,629
they won't be colliding with each other

16
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:04,010
so that way you can put as many things

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,470
you want without ever having to worried

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,530
that things might break up all you need

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,780
is to include the script on your page

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,190
and you're good to go so with that we'll

21
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,470
talk about why you I add so why do I

22
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,650
that ad then you can include your the

23
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,790
name of the model you're going to be

24
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,270
writing full and then like I say you're

25
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,470
you get a call one for a callback

26
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,370
function with the why instance and then

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,350
you can start typing or everything you

28
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,270
need all your properties you just attach

29
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,520
to the wine instance your new module and

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,100
boom you're done so this is really all

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,740
it takes to create a Wi-Fi module you

32
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,020
can also name is place your module if

33
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,600
you need to by using the keyboard

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,020
namespace this case which is you know

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,650
creating space full bar and then we just

36
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,640
touch that to the Y instance we start

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,230
running all our code inside that

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:18,790
you could also do versioning so in this

39
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,870
case once we're done declaring

40
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,280
everything that we need to for our

41
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,170
module at the bow at the very bottom we

42
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,460
can pass an argument which is a

43
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,890
configuration I mean version this

44
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,720
version this number can be anything you

45
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,720
want has nothing to do the version of

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,660
the why object this is related to your

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,010
module and you can also specify

48
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,270
requirements that you module my needs so

49
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,680
you know in this case i'm specifying

50
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,200
that full it's gonna need the node

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,350
module and this was what's going to do

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,390
is once once we include foo in the page

53
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,750
it's going to also include note for us

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,460
automatically behind the scenes three

55
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,400
powerful stuff but also we can we can

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,360
make our model a little bit more

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,120
interesting by augmenting yui base so

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,340
why do I base provides a standard

59
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,410
template for us to create a set of

60
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,070
modules that are gramma consistence are

61
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,370
along the way but it's going to do that

62
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,920
by giving us like a name property it's

63
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,530
also going to provide us an attribute

64
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,460
properly it's going to extend event so

65
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,870
we're going to have all the goodies of

66
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,140
hobby custom event on our module it's

67
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,580
going to provide unique methods on the

68
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,080
stray methods are so that are very

69
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,080
important stuff if we want to make our

70
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,640
application to be a little more

71
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,920
sophisticated and also easy to easier to

72
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,630
scale so attributes are like I say it's

73
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,100
just going to give us a consistent API

74
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,720
and on the communications and sort of

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,940
like a blueprints of how your arteries

76
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,710
are going to be hey Ilan along the way

77
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,890
through your or your application it's

78
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,210
going to have built-in setters and

79
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,850
getters for us so that way and we can

80
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,340
modify them as we need them to do

81
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,980
whatever we need them to do it's going

82
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,070
to provide a name spacing and I'll see

83
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,810
ya so everything going to be talking

84
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,000
about you can also refer to the

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,799
documentation developer de yahoo that

86
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,470
comment / Yui but let me show you an

87
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:23,980
example

88
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,730
um so going back to our full a module

89
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:33,250
here we're going to create our class

90
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,320
right now we're our base class object

91
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,850
and then we're going to augment it with

92
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,250
the name propria and now my class is

93
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,170
going to have my name right whatever you

94
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,200
want it to be we can also like I say use

95
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,960
the attributes propri to declare all the

96
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,850
attributes our class is going to have by

97
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,060
default and then once once we're done

98
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,580
then all we need to do is just we're

99
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,180
going to extend our class with why that

100
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,490
base and then automatically as we do

101
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,140
that everything is going to be all the

102
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,910
preparation of bays are going to be put

103
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,600
into my class attributes event I'm so

104
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,510
that way we really have a module with a

105
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,000
feeling lines of code a model is ready

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,730
to go that can do all these cool things

107
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,920
like events right so by doing that we

108
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,080
get for free custom events we get bubble

109
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,480
event even I then broadcast them so in

110
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,400
this case right if we were to create a

111
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
cloud we had a class called goonie and

112
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,550
then we are going to associate a method

113
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,250
that says never say that okay and then

114
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,430
what we want to do is I want this event

115
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,290
never see that happens we're going to

116
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,140
fight when I broadcast say hey you know

117
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,410
I've been called let everyone everyone

118
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,910
that's subscribing to me listen you know

119
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,990
so here when we get our object my goonie

120
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,190
we can subscribe to to the event never

121
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,890
say die and once this guy's fire we're

122
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,990
going to be alert and hey you guys so

123
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,330
cool thing or one thing you you you want

124
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,830
to notice is that we actually isn't

125
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,530
listening for goonie column never say

126
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,350
die because why you are based give you

127
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,570
the name is spacing that we talked about

128
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,900
with the name attribute so this way it's

129
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,840
easy to have multiple broadcasting

130
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,640
events on the same on the page on your

131
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,720
module

132
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,600
by just declaring the name attribute

133
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,530
trickles out yeah you can you can

134
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,400
probably learn more about events and Yui

135
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,870
based on the documentation just want to

136
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,870
go over through the main stuff but I

137
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,020
don't want to extend tonight so once

138
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,850
we're done with our modules right what

139
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,680
do how do we include them in the page

140
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,500
right we you know we really worked on it

141
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,450
and it's ready to go how do we load it

142
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,850
well this is several ways you can load

143
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,150
our modern Yui 3 first one is by

144
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,060
inclusion so let's say we have the

145
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,950
simple really simple module today right

146
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,680
that all it does it just told us what

147
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,920
days today so if we were to use that

148
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,520
module then we're going to be using the

149
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,220
keyword use we're going to include our

150
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,480
two-day module and then what's going to

151
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,400
happen is why instance is going to have

152
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,160
all of this ready for us to you so in

153
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,580
this case I'm also requiring note so at

154
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,830
this point today I know our being

155
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,300
loading the page so i can use all the

156
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,260
notes all the cool knows stuff so why

157
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,930
don't one when it's going to get a

158
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,169
reference to an element with the ID one

159
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:58,150
and then we're going to set the content

160
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,169
to today's date really simple way to use

161
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:04,570
to load your models on the page if you

162
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,540
have you can compare concatenated

163
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,790
everything together or or you can put in

164
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,630
the script tag on top wherever you want

165
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,190
you could also pass a configuration

166
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,750
object when you're loading your modules

167
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,100
are so to the Yui function you can you

168
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,610
can pass a module configuration object

169
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,830
with the name of your module the path to

170
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,830
where the new model is hosted and all

171
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,450
and all the requirements are so this is

172
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,219
this Way's all of a more advanced but if

173
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:38,080
you need to you can you can use it they

174
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,630
prefer way it just is why do I use it

175
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,839
just takes care of everything for you

176
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,240
but then again at this point y will be

177
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,580
ready with everything you specify here

178
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,910
pretty simple gets you up up and running

179
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,480
through it pretty fast this day said

180
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,880
there's a third way to load modules you

181
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,780
know in your page and that is using the

182
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,830
Yui gallery so I'm going to talk to you

183
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,780
guys about the Yui gallery no not

184
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,640
because it's something something really

185
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,730
cool that I love and I'm basically just

186
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,470
going to show you how to be lazy we

187
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,920
writing your code and just use Yui

188
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,770
galleries to do your work for you pretty

189
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:28,190
much so why do I color you get instant

190
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,210
access to first class citizen modules on

191
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,840
modules have been written by developers

192
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,620
to developers are you Adam simply by you

193
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,590
on your way initiating them on your Yui

194
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,620
use statement you do why do I use and

195
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,680
then you pass in the name of your module

196
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,500
done some of the modules examples that

197
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,750
we have right now so we have a walk you

198
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,490
module we have an accordion weekly we

199
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,920
have a Twitter module so they say

200
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,780
hundreds and I think it's like 90 right

201
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,970
now across 100 so and it's growing

202
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,860
growing sofa so really powerful stuff

203
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,750
pretty cool it will let you load any

204
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,760
module that do all this cool thing but

205
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:17,060
just using Yui that use so this is

206
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,350
really cool this is I love it so let me

207
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,790
just give you a quick demo that i put

208
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,730
together with a few lines of code what

209
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,580
I've done here I have a set of tags

210
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,240
right here well things that I want to

211
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,520
look for okay and then I have a tag

212
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,420
cloud so i'm using this case the

213
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,730
drag-and-drop module which is going to

214
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,130
allow me to drag these elements around

215
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,600
the page and drop them into another

216
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,620
object i'm using the YQL module which is

217
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,930
going to allow me to do queries to

218
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,750
flickr all client side and it's going to

219
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,740
determine all the pictures that match

220
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,630
this talks

221
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,150
and then of course i'm using all the

222
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:10,580
known and an Athenia that's that's about

223
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,710
it so with three modules I'm able to

224
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,800
simply create this with a few lines of

225
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,120
code in five minutes so if i were to

226
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:30,590
drag iphone here no uh yeah it's just a

227
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,030
little slow but just the Wi-Fi it's all

228
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,330
of it and now is getting all the

229
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,570
pictures for us but yeah so basically i

230
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,900
also drop the tags into I mean to talk

231
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,230
into the cloud with the white qmo do i'm

232
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,770
able to query flickr and get all these

233
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,600
pictures that much iphone and then

234
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,350
presented naming the page with using the

235
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,950
node and the animation module so if i

236
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,000
were to you know i can i can drag on I'm

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,590
gonna do it because it's very slow but I

238
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,200
can drag as many taxes in one here and

239
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,230
then it's gonna do the same thing nice

240
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,130
looking for iphone a bluebottle so yeah

241
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,500
I guess people who were blue bottle

242
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,090
coffee with his iphone ticket I don't

243
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,900
know anyways but yeah let me show you

244
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,510
one of the most important pieces of the

245
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,990
code so why you I when I gonna wanna

246
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,750
accentuate my mom my Yui function I can

247
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,510
I can pass this this this is optional if

248
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,310
you know that you want to be using a

249
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,500
specific version of a module you can

250
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,180
specify by ah according the the date

251
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,610
where the module on the first diversion

252
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,340
of the model you're looking for but if

253
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,170
you don't that's that's totally fine and

254
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,620
then right you know right after only on

255
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,780
our entertainment we start putting all

256
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,770
everything that we need um so gallery

257
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,410
YQL it's going to pull in the gallery

258
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,600
walk your model for us and we don't need

259
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,210
to worry about what it is or the path or

260
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,890
and we just know it's gonna be it's

261
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,660
going to be available to us it's going

262
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,150
to

263
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,240
for us to use and then once we get that

264
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,680
we're easily just able to query flickr

265
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,020
with the talks and then once we want one

266
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,450
we get the query back then do something

267
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,050
so few line of code boom I'll you know

268
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,710
three powerful applications I love this

269
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,510
so the cool thing about this is that you

270
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,550
can actually contribute to the wire why

271
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,620
do I gallery because he's open to

272
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,110
everyone it's open for everyone all of

273
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,210
you can be running models right now and

274
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,610
now you can submit it to the to the

275
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,750
gallery so benefit your code will be in

276
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,990
yahoo CDN so what this means is that you

277
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,910
once you submit your your module anyone

278
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,570
can use it by just on the on the on the

279
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,930
on the youth statement huh this gives

280
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,980
you also yeah so your module more or

281
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,800
less the process it takes like one week

282
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,300
and your mother will be up and ready to

283
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,850
use that this will be a lot of obviously

284
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,610
disability and I like I mentioned before

285
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,800
is it accessible within your Yui that

286
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,010
you stay men and also you'll be

287
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,300
contributing I mean part of the JS

288
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,780
community so pretty cool so how do you

289
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,730
do this it's real easy just follow these

290
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,430
five steps you create your module just

291
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,710
like I show you today on you create a

292
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,920
white-white library account you fork Yui

293
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,440
3 and github we open source go get the

294
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,380
code mess with it use some in your

295
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,350
module to us then we are proven and then

296
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,520
we return on yahoo servers pretty cool

297
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,450
if you ask me so um you wanna start
