2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,750
and I'm a developer evangelist for a

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,180
company called twilio we're based in San

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,529
Francisco the company is based in San

5
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,180
Francisco but actually I hail from

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,910
Seattle so I'm incredibly happy to be

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,650
here amongst the Sun and the warmth of

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,920
florida and i'm here to talk to you

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,290
about a subject that is a very near and

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,800
dear to my heart and that is what are we

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,160
as a community going to do to make more

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,379
people around the world interested in

13
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,290
programming you know I I come at this

14
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,000
from a very you know unique perspective

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
not unique I come from it from my own

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,260
perspective you know I'm a father I

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,659
think a lot of people who sort of

18
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,720
understand the lack of desire to program

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,330
and are working to combat it you know

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,320
come at this from lots of different

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,939
perspectives you know some of them are

22
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,430
educators you know lots of people have

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,340
reasons to care about this issue but I

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,179
care about it because I'm a dad I have

25
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:26,969
two beautiful daughters the first one is

26
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,060
Katherine Katherine is three and a half

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,460
years old this photo was taken one year

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,049
ago at j/s comp in Scottsdale and she

29
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,369
may look like she's coding but she

30
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,770
really isn't I just it was more of a

31
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,280
photo op but a funny story about about

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,729
kids and conferences so hi conferences

33
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,830
have tons of stairs ok

34
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,750
plaintiff everywhere you know that light

35
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,790
stickers in my top so so who here was it

36
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,970
James comp last year awesome so you know

37
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,280
if Katherine wandered up to you and

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,620
stole stickers from you I apologize but

39
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,120
it's totally not rapala this is how they

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,990
are my other daughter is Emily this is

41
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,700
her she's gonna be two in august and my

42
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,970
why it's amazing my wife knows that I'm

43
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,980
adulterer and I'm an error and all

44
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,960
developers love mustaches for some

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,590
reason so she bought Emily this mustache

46
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,070
onesie which is why I'm choosing a

47
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,410
particular picture to show you guys but

48
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,310
but the point is you know I had this

49
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,030
becomes interested in this issue of

50
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,980
people not getting into coding and

51
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,530
become a father and I'm i intensely

52
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,480
think about the future much more than I

53
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,730
used to and I think about their future

54
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,160
and I think about what they like what

55
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,110
they might do or what they might want to

56
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,610
do what they might think that they're

57
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,100
actually capable of doing and you know

58
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,930
I'm a I'm a technical person their

59
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,700
mother is a technical person naturally

60
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,100
you know I think about you know whether

61
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,989
they will be technical people we all get

62
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:07,370
into the technology industry and

63
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,110
even if they watching with what kind of

64
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,480
barriers Monday days I also had two

65
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,780
daughters and my life are not gonna have

66
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,599
any more tolerant so I now I'm actually

67
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,280
aware the gender issues in our industry

68
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,799
intensely concerned about them and in

69
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,569
somebody that aside sometimes I feel

70
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,430
like I'm very my hands I because you

71
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,989
know I see a lot of people do not to get

72
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:31,819
bangs trying to dress this but the

73
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,659
numbers ourselves so I'm pull get into a

74
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:39,230
layer so I look look at the world is

75
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,129
living and I feel like this is this is a

76
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,489
bit of a name you know I apologize if it

77
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,590
feels play out but no software is he in

78
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,099
the world that is a titled an article

79
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,799
written by a guy named Mark Henry's he

80
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,060
published it in Wall Street Journal

81
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,299
couple years ago and it was pretty much

82
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,579
treatise on the fact that every single

83
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:04,700
industry in the world is being devoured

84
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,840
by software or software companies and

85
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,609
you don't have to look far to see how

86
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:13,730
great I was just watching that in my

87
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,479
life last Sunday night yeah well guess

88
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:19,280
who the biggest advertising company in

89
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,300
the world soccer it's google you know

90
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,849
look at think the largest retailer in

91
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,570
the world is standard life you know i

92
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,010
don't want to get caught up on whose

93
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,590
number

94
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,610
maybe there's some of the tables

95
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,920
slightly bigger than amazon by revenue

96
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,160
right now i have every confidence steps

97
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,800
in that place is a great example there's

98
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,270
going to be more video than anybody else

99
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,750
and maybe they're not technically as big

100
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,040
as some of the largest some of the

101
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,230
larger media conglomerates today but i

102
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,050
believe they will be no case our necks

103
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,340
are is both critically acclaimed and one

104
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,410
of the most profitable movie in movies

105
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,660
videos in the world and they're a

106
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,030
software company that are obviously

107
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,710
people that work ethics are that are not

108
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,140
developers but everyone in that company

109
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,600
is a software person they think about

110
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,490
how they can use software create

111
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,810
experiences for people and the list of

112
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,980
industries that's being destructive

113
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,620
today you know goes on and on then you

114
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,140
might say Carter you know that's a

115
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,820
sucker for all industries you know there

116
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,810
are plenty of industries that are

117
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,720
resistant to this disruption you know

118
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,940
whatever your pet industry my 80 or your

119
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,340
friends pet industry and I'm just I just

120
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,190
believe you're wrong you know you can

121
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,860
look at the automobile industry right

122
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,450
you may save yourself hey that's out

123
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,090
there Tesla's not a software company it

124
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,820
just make really sick amazing electric

125
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,430
vehicles they're very expensive and it

126
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,260
will very well designed and that people

127
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,950
love and you don't have to listen to me

128
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,129
and

129
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,559
you can listen to you on right talked to

130
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,839
three interviews deal on loss I'll tell

131
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,479
you the kind of people with Tesla hi

132
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,149
rose our software people the kind of

133
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:07,789
people who think that software can

134
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:12,559
enhance experiences for people when you

135
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,659
look at how roaster and model s ur

136
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,659
designed their massive computing

137
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:20,779
machines they collect gigabytes and

138
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,749
terabytes data send it back to Tesla and

139
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,479
Tesla uses the data to improve the

140
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,479
software for the cars in almost real

141
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,610
time and over longer destructions of

142
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,559
time these assaulted or produce better

143
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,459
designs so you know who is Elon Musk I

144
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,469
guess what he needs he founded paypal

145
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,779
you know he's a software person he's

146
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:43,639
applying what he knows in the softball

147
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,279
field to other industries and I this is

148
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,259
a pattern you know you're going to see

149
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,029
over and over and other industries this

150
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,189
is the UM this is the CEO of the company

151
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:59,990
I work for Jeff Lawson coolio was trying

152
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,939
to disrupt the telecom industry I'm

153
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,860
sorry reason or disrupt it's a crappy

154
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,279
word I should have fun without a word

155
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,679
but what is really trying to do this

156
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,839
he's trying to empower software people

157
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,589
to build amazing experiences for people

158
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:17,300
you know on top of the telecom

159
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,099
infrastructure you know think about the

160
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:24,769
worst phone you've ever used and some

161
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:26,229
company you work

162
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,029
god forbid a pay phone like you're as

163
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,830
old as me like you remember these

164
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,589
horrific experiences trying to dial

165
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:36,499
extensions get rowdy and connected like

166
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,929
those are experiences that are designed

167
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:40,969
and built and delivered by hardware

168
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:44,029
people coolio is trying to enable

169
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,729
software people to build much more

170
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:49,159
elegant user-friendly experiences and

171
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,649
that's incredibly important and you see

172
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,059
this you know not just in telecom

173
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,649
immunity so this with things as simple

174
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,559
as a remote control look at a cable or a

175
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,240
television remote control it's

176
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,149
disgusting but it's a byproduct of

177
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,279
Engineers of hardware engineers and how

178
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,169
they think about user interface and

179
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,819
solving problems look at the apple

180
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,429
remote it's beautiful tell Ian you know

181
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:11,899
it's multifunctional you can do lots of

182
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:15,289
things my wife had we recently bought a

183
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,179
house and one of the first purchase even

184
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:21,379
made the nest you know like why you know

185
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,059
I don't I don't know why write me on

186
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:25,039
some level I thought that the thermostat

187
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,809
that was there was just ugly and was

188
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,399
right in my dining room right we're

189
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,839
going to be entertaining people is his

190
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,029
ugly disgusting thing but also i think i

191
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,169
didn't know i didn't understand how to

192
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,599
use it was unapproachable to me and then

193
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,399
yes came along and created something

194
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,139
better and it increasingly better

195
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,459
accidentally they create something

196
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,110
better because their software people and

197
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,389
they apply to think about software to

198
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:47,029
the problem of thermostats and you're

199
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,579
seeing this over and over again so if

200
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:50,709
you believe what I've said so far

201
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:53,959
there's this consequence this is another

202
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,019
tired cliché that I happen to believe is

203
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:00,019
true you know programming is literacy

204
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:03,350
maybe it's not literacy today but it's

205
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,939
going to be literacy by the time you

206
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:09,529
know my daughters are older people take

207
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,480
literacy for granted I think people in

208
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,670
the US take literacy for granted I think

209
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,050
there are people who work for nonprofits

210
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,939
and people who are exposed to other

211
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:18,589
parts of the world that do not take

212
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,810
literacy for granted and understand how

213
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,689
critical literacy is to lifting people

214
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:27,290
out of poverty in 1440 when Gutenberg

215
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,800
invented the printing press only thirty

216
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,569
percent of continental Europe was

217
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:34,970
literate and you know now today the the

218
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,709
number is probably in the neo not you

219
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,170
know like you know 99 percent or

220
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,500
something

221
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,170
like that right and literacy isn't just

222
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,790
an abstract thing right literacy

223
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,500
directly translates to better health

224
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,580
greater social equality and increased an

225
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,940
economic prosperity so if that's what

226
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,930
literacy is and you believe that

227
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,280
programming knowing how to code is

228
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,290
becoming a form of literacy then you

229
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,380
should have pause for you know for the

230
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,060
state of the world today and and where

231
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,570
we're going here's another fact that i

232
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,170
find to be incredibly disturbing young

233
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,570
people are not embracing programming now

234
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,070
this is the freakiest thing of them all

235
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,770
right because anybody can look at a

236
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,660
demographic trend and kind of plot out

237
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,540
into the future that's easy I graduated

238
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,480
from high school in 1996 in the mid 90s

239
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,670
if you thought programming was stupid or

240
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,920
you thought email was stupid that was

241
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,190
totally okay like that was a rational

242
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,050
understandable you know opinion to have

243
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,290
about technology at that point because

244
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,450
email was esoteric and the web was brand

245
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,890
new and you could be forgiven for

246
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,940
thinking that you could spend your whole

247
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,570
life and never have to touch email

248
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:52,280
however the fact that today the fact

249
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,430
that it's 2013 and people still sort of

250
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,890
feel this way about technology and about

251
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,990
being able to wield technology is

252
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,450
unbelievably frightening I mean look at

253
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,940
these numbers you know like you could

254
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,010
other than some blips you know

255
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,770
enrollment in computer science is first

256
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,290
of all pathetic but also fairly flat

257
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,500
right I mean there's mild growth but

258
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,760
nowhere near the kind of growth you

259
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,060
would expect same with engineering like

260
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,800
how is this possible right how is it

261
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,830
possible that intelligent pragmatic you

262
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,630
know educated young people can look at

263
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,130
the world that they live in in the world

264
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,330
that they're likely to live in and

265
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,310
completely reject learning how to

266
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,840
program or learning anything about how

267
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,450
to wield a computer I find this like

268
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,880
baffling an astonishing and scary and

269
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,840
then of course you know the gender

270
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,450
inequality is you know is as dramatic as

271
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,940
well so so the question is you know

272
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,830
what's happening and I don't have

273
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,210
answers you know I'm trust me there are

274
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,080
people who spend more time thinking

275
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,880
about this than me I'm here to say that

276
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,640
we all need to work on fixing this you

277
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,200
know there's you know there are

278
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,330
incredibly smart people like John Resig

279
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,970
you know working at Khan Academy trying

280
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,490
to sort of reinvent education thank god

281
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,830
bless them thank God but I think the

282
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,300
problem is more pervasive than that I

283
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,560
think every single person in this room

284
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,880
can help can help address this problem

285
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,800
and not and more so I want and I want to

286
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,940
say something stronger right we have a

287
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,620
moral imperative to solve this problem

288
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,990
you know this problem is no different

289
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,420
than women suffer it i mean you know i

290
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,770
hate to draw direct comparisons but you

291
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,850
know to me it is in the same ballpark as

292
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,910
women's suffrage and other social issues

293
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,630
that people had to deal with in the past

294
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,030
because of the the fact that being

295
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,490
literate translates into how the quality

296
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,240
of the life that you can live this is a

297
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,230
Reginald Braithwaite I had to look up

298
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,260
his name I know Emma's Ragan Wald on

299
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,630
hacker news he's just a prolific writer

300
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,910
and you know he wrote a blog post

301
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,280
recently called Colin all hackers and he

302
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,900
you know he sees the world that I see

303
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,480
right he sees a world where you know

304
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,580
there's a massive amount of sort of

305
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,010
cultural exclusion of outsiders in the

306
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,770
technology industry and he wonders why

307
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,380
this is the case and what we need to do

308
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,140
to fix this he sees a very uneven

309
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,530
application of programming in the world

310
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,840
right so think of all the places you

311
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,270
could apply programming and software and

312
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,270
it's cool it's very lumpy right and this

313
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,700
is incredibly problematic and

314
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,640
essentially he he wrote a blog post

315
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,710
where he was calling out to hackers and

316
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,770
why was he doing that well hackers

317
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,889
hackers change the world

318
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:46,420
the way they change the world is that

319
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,699
they wrap around damage right they see

320
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,649
things that are broken and they try to

321
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,449
fix it's a it's just something that's

322
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,549
inside of a person if you if you think

323
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:56,350
of yourself as a hacker you're the kind

324
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,639
of problem that wants you're the kind of

325
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,319
person that wants to solve problems and

326
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,759
wants to fix things and wants to make

327
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,439
the world better and you sort of put out

328
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:05,109
this you know this sort of you know this

329
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:08,819
message asking people to really dive in

330
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:11,169
who know who here knows who brett victor

331
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:15,939
is a few of you i watch the video three

332
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,970
weeks ago that was one bleep called

333
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,299
inventing on principle and he informed

334
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:24,730
his talk quite quite a bit right Victor

335
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,399
is he working lots of places and he did

336
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,129
a lot of innovative you I work at Apple

337
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,689
and he there's this hour long video on

338
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:32,769
the internet called inventing on

339
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,689
principle where he's giving a talk much

340
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:36,819
better than this talk by the way where

341
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:39,309
and you know and I have an appendix of

342
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:40,629
links and you guys should go check it

343
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,230
out we're basically he says it is

344
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,379
morally wrong for people who build tools

345
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:50,079
and technology and platforms to build

346
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,899
them in such a poor way that ideas are

347
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:57,399
allowed to die what he's trying to say

348
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,239
is that we are we are all created we're

349
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:03,160
all creators in some some sense of that

350
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,169
word right we're no a programmer is no

351
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,059
different than a sculptor or painter or

352
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:09,040
writer someone who creates something and

353
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,819
there's this human need for creators to

354
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:15,100
have an immediate connection to like

355
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,350
what they're creating so like a painter

356
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,110
every stroke there see they're getting

357
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,179
feedback like real-time feedback on what

358
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:24,009
they're doing same with a sculptor

359
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:26,259
sculptor same with a writer and Brett

360
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,429
looked at the world of being a

361
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:29,679
programmer and you know looked at the

362
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,379
sort of the process of writing code in

363
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:34,720
an IDE and then compiling that code and

364
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,069
then maybe deploying that code to a

365
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,279
device and then running the code and in

366
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,889
some cases the Delta is massive right

367
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,289
and you don't find out until five

368
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:46,869
minutes later that something's wrong or

369
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:48,459
that you know that you did something

370
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,910
wrong and that that breaks things for

371
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,360
the programmers that are a flawless

372
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,239
never make mistakes or be incredibly

373
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:58,870
patient

374
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,460
it's not a problem because if you don't

375
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,810
make mistakes you won't make any

376
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,130
mistakes and if you're incredibly

377
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,570
patient you don't care you'll just wait

378
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,880
the problem is that most of the world is

379
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,310
not like that most of the world when you

380
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,779
look at when you when you look at the

381
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,940
dropout rates in computer science and

382
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,370
engineering these people are at least

383
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,950
initially interested in these fields but

384
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,010
then they drop out they quit and why do

385
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,630
they quit well there's lots of reasons

386
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,790
but i think that the state of tool in

387
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,380
today's part of the reason that people

388
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,870
quit they try to do something and they

389
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,720
don't get immediate feedback on on what

390
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,070
they're doing or the result of what

391
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,470
they're doing and it essentially causes

392
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,540
them to give up on it and then their

393
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,779
idea dies right and that is it's wrong

394
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:43,360
because that person could have an idea

395
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,790
that changes the world but it died

396
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,130
because we didn't give them good enough

397
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:53,830
tools to use so i think i mentioned that

398
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,080
i don't have you know a definitive

399
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,430
solution for this I don't think anybody

400
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,029
does but I have I have this thought that

401
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:04,569
um that better api's can help write that

402
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:08,020
better api's can be a part of this

403
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,569
larger story better tooling can out

404
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,980
there's lots of things that can help I

405
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,079
happen to spend a lot of time thinking

406
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,500
about api's so I'm sort of approaching

407
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,790
this problem from somewhat of a specific

408
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,300
perspective so the question so first

409
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,860
question you'll like what is an API and

410
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,390
I'm not trying to devolve into that

411
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,760
argument you can the truth is actually

412
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,230
everyone has their own specific

413
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,059
definition of what an API is and people

414
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,010
argue about it and it's like you know I

415
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,800
hate these arguments I think we all know

416
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,960
what a languages know we're all

417
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,059
presumably JavaScript developers you

418
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,410
know we understand that languages have

419
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,750
syntax and two met semantics and have a

420
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,630
grammar and to me like an API is just

421
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,179
anything on top of that

422
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,659
a well-defined interface to enabling

423
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,159
somebody to do something that they want

424
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,619
to do above and beyond the language

425
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:00,210
itself helps you solve problems you know

426
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,529
so let's say we're on a web page and we

427
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:02,940
want to find the boxes that are checked

428
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,740
on a web page right well there's this

429
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,509
awesome API called the JavaScript Dom

430
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:09,090
API just kidding it's not awesome at all

431
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,240
sucks and that's what the code looks

432
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,919
like all right that's gross right now it

433
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,529
works and it's logical you know you can

434
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:20,879
kind of look at it but that's an insane

435
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:23,220
number amount of code to write to do

436
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,379
something relatively basic it's also

437
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:27,480
error-prone right because even if you

438
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,509
know JavaScript like did you know that

439
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,360
you can't use for each to iterate

440
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,149
through a node list maybe you know that

441
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,100
from experience like from the terrible

442
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,749
experience of trying it and having to

443
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,970
fail but this is just it's just not a

444
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,600
good API it's not good API design you

445
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,309
know contrast that to the jQuery API

446
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,720
look i'm not i'm not trying to sell

447
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,730
jquery right a lot of people moving away

448
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,259
from jQuery and for totally valid

449
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:54,690
reasons but that has nothing to do with

450
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,119
the design of its API just has it has to

451
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,259
do with the kind of problems that people

452
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:00,059
are trying to solve you know this is

453
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,549
what it takes to do this in jQuery once

454
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:04,440
again I don't find it surprising at all

455
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,470
that John Resig is tackling education I

456
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,129
think if you find an API in the world

457
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:14,039
that you find to be elegant and easy and

458
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,470
understandable and pleasant to use the

459
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,169
person who designed it probably cares

460
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:21,690
about your your experience using it and

461
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,100
probably cares about education and

462
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,809
probably wishes that more people would

463
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:31,679
use that API so then their web AP is you

464
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,629
know we all we all know what web api zar

465
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:35,309
we're all familiar with them this is

466
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:38,190
this is roy fielding so Roy fielding

467
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,110
wrote an incredibly famous dissertation

468
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,690
on unrest on rest and that works spawned

469
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,679
a multitude of companies like twilio and

470
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,600
many many others that provide these

471
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,860
restful Web API s and these are these AP

472
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,539
eyes are amazing they're amazing for

473
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,220
lots of reasons and i'm not going to go

474
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,530
into all of them but you know they

475
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,570
a they took something I actually come

476
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,370
from an era kind of prior you know prior

477
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,830
to the the onslaught of restful api is i

478
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,750
come i remember soap does anyone here

479
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,110
remember soap okay oh my god yeah like

480
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,820
shocker that soap didn't catch on right

481
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,830
but there's a there's a reason it didn't

482
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,480
catch on it wasn't accessible it wasn't

483
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,190
understandable it was monolithic it had

484
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,440
all these terrible characteristics that

485
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,030
the big company didn't care about

486
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,770
because they didn't care about the

487
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,440
pervasiveness of soap services you know

488
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,400
they cared about solving their

489
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,410
particular problems and charging you

490
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,120
like a ton of money you know for the

491
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,220
privilege of having that having those

492
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,530
problem solved so I'm not surprised so

493
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,090
there's no surprises so failed it wasn't

494
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,130
democratic you know restful api so very

495
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,330
democratic you know even a novice

496
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,430
developer can understand and interact

497
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,490
with with a restful api the twilio api

498
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,370
is is an example of this so you know we

499
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,720
like to say a twilio you know if you're

500
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,360
if you're a web developer you're

501
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,160
automatically a twilio developer and

502
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,480
there's a means part of that is

503
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,690
marketing but part of that is true you

504
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,240
know this is this is some node some node

505
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,620
code to send an SMS it's it's I mean if

506
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,890
you know in reality is like two lines of

507
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,200
code to send an SMS I was in Vancouver

508
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
and I was sitting next to some kids some

509
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,460
sophomores in college that had never

510
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,860
heard of twilio I pulled out my my

511
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,780
computer and I just asked them hey

512
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,340
what's your cell phone number man and i

513
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,990
sent them SMS right in front of them I

514
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,790
couldn't believe I mean why I can

515
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,930
believe it now right but I mean in

516
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,980
writing if you really think about like

517
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,570
they were blown away like I might as

518
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,100
well like started walking on the ceiling

519
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,660
as far as they were concerned because

520
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,000
they simply they did not grasp that that

521
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,290
was something that they were capable of

522
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,870
doing and I think that's true for for

523
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,890
way more people than we realize process

524
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,020
that that's example of sending an SMS

525
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,600
out processing an SMS so twilio makes

526
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,450
makes use of web hooks which means that

527
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,580
every time an SMS comes in to twilio we

528
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,620
send a post request to your web

529
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,030
application and your web application

530
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,600
returns with markup in this case as web

531
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,710
developers you're all familiar with

532
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,350
markup like you're familiar with HTML

533
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,460
the only difference is with Willie oh

534
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,740
you just you generate some XML but

535
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,060
you're still generating mark up every

536
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,250
single tool that you use to generate

537
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,950
markup every part of your tool chain you

538
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,100
can still use it

539
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,470
need to generate a little bit of XML so

540
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,510
this is where you know we kind of come

541
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,840
to the end of this talk and I honestly

542
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,299
believe that every single person sitting

543
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:32,020
here can help solve this problem right

544
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,850
can at least take a small step towards

545
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,530
solving this problem you do not have to

546
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,039
be the chief architect for some you know

547
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,160
restful api company in order to like

548
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,660
make the world a better in order to

549
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,970
create better api's and make the world a

550
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,039
better and more accessible for place for

551
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,409
people trying to get into programming

552
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,909
you know like first of all think about

553
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:53,409
think about the industry that you work

554
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,299
in right like I don't care what it is

555
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:58,870
like try to make the world try to make

556
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,460
more of the world more of the surface

557
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,140
area of the world addressable to

558
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,530
programming you know jeff says you know

559
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,250
if you can if you can turn a problem

560
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,470
into a software problem like you can

561
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,320
solve it right if you can find a way to

562
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,419
like make more things that you work on

563
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:18,909
addressable to programmers you know

564
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:20,710
you're going to be able to harness you

565
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,809
know all the program is in the world to

566
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:23,980
sort of solve some of the problems that

567
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,100
are in your industry improve the

568
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,140
accessibility of your AP is like I'm

569
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,850
talking every API right like if look if

570
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,760
you write a function or method and that

571
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,919
function is going to be called by

572
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,049
someone on your team or someone in your

573
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,409
group or someone at your company or

574
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:43,000
someone outside of your company like

575
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,470
literally if you're defining a method

576
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,480
signature like think really hard about

577
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,260
it think ten times as hard about it as

578
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,919
you normally do just as an experiment um

579
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,990
you know I you know I I've started doing

580
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,059
this myself right like I have a ton of

581
00:23:58,059 --> 00:23:59,980
crappy code out there and I used to

582
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,450
think it didn't matter because it was

583
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,760
just my problem you know that's not true

584
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,039
you know like the with more more and

585
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,210
more people looking at code on github

586
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,610
you know people are learning like how to

587
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,980
code from you know code snippets that

588
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,970
you would never think that they would

589
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,130
look at and if they're bad code snippet

590
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,419
so they're poorly documented or they

591
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:18,220
don't make sense or they don't provide

592
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,380
instant feedback then they make it get

593
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,510
to stir discouraged maybe decide you

594
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,710
know screw this I don't want to do this

595
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,010
this is a crazy esoteric field for you

596
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,520
know

597
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,740
masochists and that's terrible right so

598
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,140
you know I think I think we all have a

599
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,910
role to play here and lastly please

600
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,220
commit yourself to helping more people

601
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,320
learn how to code a twilio every single

602
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,120
person who joins the company no matter

603
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,190
what role they have has to write an

604
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,530
application their first week on the job

605
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,400
that salespeople marketers customer

606
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
service administrative support it

607
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,200
doesn't matter who you are like you have

608
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,300
to write an application and that's and

609
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,320
you might think that's really daunting

610
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,260
and like holy crap but that's unfair but

611
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,090
it actually isn't because everyone at

612
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,440
the company is part of our culture and

613
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,780
everyone at the company rallies to help

614
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,510
that person define what it is they want

615
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,520
to try to do and help teach them how to

616
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,820
do it like companies should do stuff

617
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,500
like this and it also doesn't have to be

618
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,120
a company thing like find someone in

619
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,950
your life that is curious about

620
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,600
programming and expose them to it and

621
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,340
talk to them about it and learn from

622
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,890
them what is so inaccessible and so

623
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,050
daunting about it and see what we can do

624
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,240
to you know to kind of help make a help

625
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,050
make the world a better place so that's

626
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:51,060
it thank you very much

627
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,340
you
