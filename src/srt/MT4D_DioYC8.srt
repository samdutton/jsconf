[Music]

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,960
thank you very much this is really

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
happening isn't it um uh hey as I said

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,039
max was originally going to give this

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,310
talk they had to pull out for family

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:23,970
reasons

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,250
him and I have worked really closely for

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,140
about a year on our project of CSS and

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,580
JavaScript project called style

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,969
components and so he asked and the

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,950
organizers here asked if I might be able

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,590
to fill in which is daunting I've only

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,930
had about 24 hours to prepare so I

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,510
please ask your forgiveness for the

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,829
general improvisational tone of my

16
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,230
presentation today but I wanted to do

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,309
this because there was a lot of stuff

18
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,460
that I knew that max wanted to talk to

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,930
you about he wanted to share with you

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,199
wanted to see your reaction to and get

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,589
your feedback on and so I thought if I

22
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,930
could come up here I could potentially

23
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,890
do that obviously I'm not going to be

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,299
able to do exactly what max was going to

25
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,600
do but what I thought I could do and

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,869
could try to get prepared in a day was

27
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,540
to talk about my own perspective on the

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,030
work that we've both done my own journey

29
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,729
into working in CSS and JavaScript and

30
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,009
hopefully along the way cover everything

31
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,650
that max wanted to tell you using his

32
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,009
slides so I thought I'd start by

33
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,659
introducing myself my name is Blaine I'm

34
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,670
from Australia I'm from Melbourne like

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,240
Mark who just spoke if you were here at

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,939
CFS come see you last time around 18

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,979
months ago I was talking about a project

38
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,600
that Mark and I worked on called CSS

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,759
modules these days I am much more

40
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,780
involved install components in fact

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,119
that's my main focus and I've become a

42
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,390
really strong believer in CSS and

43
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,680
JavaScript for a lot of the same reasons

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,210
that Mark just explained but I think

45
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,950
it's a place of real innovation and it's

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,360
really exciting and I wanted to try to

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,009
convey some of the things that I thought

48
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,390
were important where

49
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,400
and I've been working on it and why I

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,130
think you potentially may want to get

51
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,010
involved as well I was trying to figure

52
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,100
out what the summary of Max's talk was

53
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,330
going to be and so I thought I'd start

54
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,819
with the conclusion which is that I

55
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,250
think what we're all saying is that CSS

56
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,959
and JavaScript is worth looking at if

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,480
you haven't yet it's worth your time

58
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,970
the investment in developing your skills

59
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,320
and forming your own opinions about

60
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,050
whether it's right for you it's

61
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,260
potentially only recently become a real

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,870
candidate for use in your own projects

63
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,940
but I think it is there now

64
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,370
Max and I kind of came to working on

65
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,519
this project together last year Max is

66
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,830
very heavily and you know integrated

67
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,750
into the react community I find myself

68
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,060
much more like all I'm trying to do is

69
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,130
get my CSS to work and so between the

70
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,980
two of us felt like we were maybe going

71
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,230
to stumble upon an API that might work

72
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,410
but in order to tell you about why style

73
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,080
components is the way that it is I

74
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,560
thought I'd start by the component end

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,280
of it because I think the idea of

76
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,750
building your UI in terms of components

77
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,600
is I mean I think pretty much we all

78
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,820
accept that it's a best practice but I

79
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,590
don't think it's self-evident that it

80
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,780
would be the case so I thought if we

81
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,640
talk a little bit about what makes a

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,590
good component Y component driven

83
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,720
development is actually useful it will

84
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,450
help understand why style components is

85
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,500
the way that it is oh yeah so one of the

86
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,239
things you could say you could you could

87
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,390
cast at the feet of components is that

88
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,150
it breaks the separation concerns you

89
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,670
could consider CSS HTML and JavaScript

90
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,739
to be a hundred percent separate

91
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,780
concerns and for the browser's purposes

92
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,610
they absolutely are they handle

93
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,840
differently their case differently they

94
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,850
have different performance profiles some

95
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,049
of them block rendering some of them

96
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,049
don't but as an author as you're

97
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:13,200
developing these UIs I'm not convinced

98
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,700
that technological lines are necessarily

99
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,810
the concerns of which you should be

100
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,989
separating on

101
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,069
for me components are a better

102
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:26,569
separation concerns because they

103
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,610
encapsulate a unit of functionality if

104
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,289
you're talking to your designers if

105
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:31,490
you're talking to your customers about

106
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,789
what you've built then you're talking in

107
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,370
functional units or visual units not in

108
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,530
terms of this one has JavaScript this

109
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,710
one doesn't one of the things I like

110
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,319
about encapsulation or at least like

111
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,180
about talking about a calculation is the

112
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,580
primary purpose of components is that

113
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,880
really emphasizes the importance of what

114
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,400
you call your components what you name

115
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,900
them and how you design them at what

116
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,210
their properties are and that to me is

117
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,539
the real benefit to working with this

118
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:05,419
stuff so let me show you what I mean if

119
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:08,389
you've got a button component here the

120
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:11,330
button component button class name

121
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,550
button renders out a button with a type

122
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,710
of submit and Parsa to the class name

123
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,150
now this is a react example but

124
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,940
obviously components are common

125
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,620
throughout every UI framework at the

126
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,270
moment so if you're not using react

127
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,590
hopefully you can translate these

128
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,240
examples all of the examples today will

129
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,669
be react so this is a pretty simple

130
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,070
component button the only thing that's

131
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,780
really doing is hiding the fact that

132
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,380
there's a default type of submit for me

133
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,810
if you wanted to make that button more

134
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,759
prominent Milton bigger or a different

135
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,009
color or something then you might add a

136
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,080
second class to it a primary class this

137
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,180
is sort of a been variation or modifier

138
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,610
rather that simply gets passed through

139
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,050
it doesn't change anything else about

140
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,330
the button just adds another class and

141
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,009
this is a sort of workflow I think that

142
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,810
a lot of us became quite comfortable

143
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,009
with and and doesn't scare us at all if

144
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,449
you look at another example where you

145
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,009
have to change the type of the button

146
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,259
but you also have to attach a class name

147
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:09,169
you get this sort of weird duplication

148
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,289
where you've got using two variables to

149
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,520
say the same thing because potentially

150
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,349
not all disabled buttons are the same

151
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:17,889
and so button disabled has some specific

152
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,340
CSS attached to it really what you've

153
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,650
got here is these three distinct states

154
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,030
of our component and yet there's

155
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,620
information there that we've written

156
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,159
that isn't relevant to us as we're using

157
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:32,720
these buttons

158
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,220
the class names in particular are just

159
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,710
implementation details what's really

160
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,590
important to us is that there are three

161
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,600
types of buttons currently being used

162
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,240
the default the primary and the disabled

163
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,540
this is our API contract between the

164
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,790
user and the implementation details are

165
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,970
all hidden and what's even better is

166
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,410
that you can name the component and the

167
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,880
properties whatever you want you can

168
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,680
build up a library of terms that make

169
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,960
sense to you as your team I think this

170
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,850
is even more this is more semantic than

171
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,940
working with HTML elements and class

172
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,000
names because well for one you reuse

173
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,010
HTML elements to mean very different

174
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,070
things too there's also only a limited

175
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,780
set of valid HTML elements and three

176
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,360
your class names have to be valid CSS

177
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,690
things living in a global super global

178
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,100
namespace the goal is to build up Lego

179
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,580
Vaughan's

180
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,300
like individual customized usable

181
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,260
reusable pieces that encapsulate

182
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,350
something behavior visual you know

183
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,290
information typography something and I

184
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,930
think starting from this basic point

185
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,390
when you start thinking about how you

186
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,280
would design a library for CSS and

187
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,270
JavaScript is where we got is how we

188
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,479
created style components so as Mark has

189
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,880
just said why would you want to use

190
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,729
JavaScript to pass your CSS to your

191
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,440
components why is it beneficial he

192
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,820
already talked about not automatically

193
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,040
being able to make your class names not

194
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,669
collide

195
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:08,570
maybe inline critical critical sales

196
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,800
optimization package management all of

197
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,390
those things but for me the one I one

198
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,100
thing I wanted to emphasize is that

199
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,919
JavaScript as a platform to be designing

200
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,120
these things is actually a lot more

201
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,500
powerful than anything we've been able

202
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,570
to use before you don't have a

203
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,700
preprocessor like sass that's totally

204
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,770
incompatible to every other preprocessor

205
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,460
like less you don't have post CSS

206
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,780
transforms that have to be run in a

207
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,630
certain order because they're all

208
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,550
assuming that they read in a file from

209
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,570
disk transform it and then export it

210
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,430
that fundamentally is not a power not as

211
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,740
powerful as an idea

212
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,930
as code and data just ask anyone or the

213
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,010
last time that you've had to go through

214
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,320
your web pack config to realize that

215
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,060
these files on disk have to be loaded in

216
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,470
the exact right way otherwise the

217
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,000
application rate breaks but this is kind

218
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,140
of where I got to last year this is

219
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,649
where I kind of hit a wall because I was

220
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,050
convinced by all of those arguments

221
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,390
it was definitely going to be better to

222
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,120
have altered your JavaScript or CSS in

223
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,580
JavaScript but I didn't think it was

224
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,209
better to write your CSS in JavaScript

225
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:20,850
there was nothing that was as easy as

226
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,029
fluid as powerful as the CSS that I

227
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:29,160
didn't using and so then those benefits

228
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,480
aren't worth it I mean I've only talked

229
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,520
about this morning about the skill and

230
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,610
the value of people who know CSS and how

231
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,440
that's often undervalued and in fact if

232
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,959
you design an API for those people that

233
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,390
really limits them and to ask them to

234
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,160
totally change how they work then you're

235
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,890
doing them a disservice so what I wanted

236
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,380
to do was to design a library that opens

237
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,200
up the power of the JavaScript platform

238
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,010
while still feeling like CSS and that's

239
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,890
what that's what style components aims

240
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,589
to be and this is where Max and I might

241
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,390
actually differ about how we would pitch

242
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,010
it what we would talk about how we'd

243
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,959
explain it and why we you know what

244
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,720
we're so enthusiastic about for me I see

245
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,370
style components as the CSS and

246
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,209
JavaScript libraries for CSS people I

247
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,490
think it's a making a version of CSS and

248
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,050
JavaScript that's as good as possible

249
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,370
for those people all the benefits of

250
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,570
componentization and the JavaScript

251
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,490
ecosystem without losing that power that

252
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,190
familiarity and that expressiveness she

253
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,529
max on the other hand he might take a

254
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,029
different approach he might think that

255
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:35,070
the real power behind style components

256
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,079
is the way that it lets you encapsulate

257
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,180
and combine these building blocks

258
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,430
components more easily than anything

259
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,890
else and that's actually why I'm really

260
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,770
glad to be working on this with him and

261
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,660
the rest of the wider community that

262
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,400
contributes to the project because

263
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,490
in essence the project is both it is

264
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,110
trying to do both it is trying to be

265
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,240
both the best thing for CSS people and

266
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,980
the best thing for component minded

267
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,920
people and it does that by encapsulating

268
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,020
the relationship between a style and its

269
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,750
component in something called a style

270
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,500
component right hence the name and

271
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,360
expressing your InDesign intent in a way

272
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,160
that leads you down a heavily component

273
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,330
driven path so we'll see how it works

274
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,120
now the first thing to notice is that

275
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,280
it's a normal JavaScript library

276
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,620
it doesn't require a web pack config it

277
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,570
doesn't load files from disk

278
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,580
it doesn't need a babel transform all

279
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,850
they're there there is at least two that

280
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,170
will optimize it and do other things

281
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,800
that you can look into but it's just a

282
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,190
JavaScript project the first thing you

283
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,070
do is you define a style component title

284
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,000
as a styled h1 and that could be a

285
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,130
styled div style image style anything it

286
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,780
could be a styled abstract component

287
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,220
reactor a ttle link could be anything

288
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,580
but that's your kind of syntax and then

289
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,760
beneath that you just write CSS you add

290
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,130
a little block of CSS and it should feel

291
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,890
as close to writing a CSS file as

292
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,660
possible the only things I mean if

293
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,100
you're writing this in CSS it would be

294
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,710
dot title instead of compt title the

295
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,750
only thing that's new here is a style of

296
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,240
h1 other than that this is a string now

297
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,210
you may not recognize the syntax here

298
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,630
this is a neo 6 feature called a

299
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,610
template literal which is the back tick

300
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,780
there means you can do a multi-line

301
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,760
string that then just gets passed around

302
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,990
as code this isn't being like

303
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,790
precompiled or something by babel or

304
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,720
anything for a second component on the

305
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,820
page you have the same thing a wrapper

306
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,530
component and that should feel as close

307
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,420
as possible to writing CSS as quickly

308
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,550
you know the same thing a name and some

309
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,240
rules so when you come to use the

310
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,850
component what you've done is you've

311
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,390
completely hidden that information when

312
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,790
you in this render method in this in the

313
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,280
component definition the only thing

314
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,690
that's there is the names of the

315
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,850
components using their relationship to

316
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,140
each other the fact that the wrap the

317
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,800
title is inside the brother

318
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,589
and the content right to me this is the

319
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:07,850
separation concerns that I've been

320
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,310
looking for if I want to go and change

321
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,350
the rapper to be a section tag instead

322
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,029
of a div or a main tag of want to change

323
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,029
the title via h2 h3 for any other reason

324
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,820
I don't have to actually change it here

325
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,310
that's all an implementation to detail

326
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,910
of the style component the component now

327
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,230
simply assembles these building blocks

328
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,089
but importantly and as make as mark

329
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:34,490
touched on when it renders it's just

330
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,230
HTML CSS it's not there's nothing

331
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,850
different it's not trying to do it's not

332
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,959
trying to re-implement the web platform

333
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,209
it's not trying to presuppose anything

334
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:42,560
about what it's running on it's just

335
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,350
generating H ones and classes and that

336
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,480
ability to write actual CSS I think is a

337
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,450
really big benefit but we go a little

338
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,730
bit further because most of us who've

339
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,260
worked with CSS for a long time

340
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,480
don't just write CSS we write something

341
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,790
like that and so if you look at a more

342
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,089
complex component we can see what I mean

343
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,500
if we have a color changer which in this

344
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,430
case is a styled section we can use a

345
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,260
direct descendant selector by nesting

346
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,950
and this is basically because I like

347
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,320
this from sass a lot and so I brought it

348
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,390
across now nesting is the sort of thing

349
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,740
in sass that sometimes bites you a

350
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,970
little bit and you can overuse it

351
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,790
definitely but here if that h2 is a

352
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,560
little bit more complex it'll be so easy

353
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,060
to break it out into another component

354
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,959
that it kinda doesn't have that same

355
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,520
failure case it doesn't actually go as

356
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,110
bad what's also really good is that

357
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,640
media queries that sort of thing like

358
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,550
again in sass you just put them inside a

359
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,649
component declaration when it compiles

360
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,180
they get inverted and the media query is

361
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,029
valid but it means that you can work

362
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,680
with these things as quickly and as

363
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,350
easily as you work with a satphone and

364
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,579
so that's kind of the CSS half of the

365
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,170
library which is trying to be as

366
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,060
familiar as possible and in fact like

367
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,060
familiarity I think is a huge design

368
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,140
constraint now it's something that's

369
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,570
really difficult to do like the

370
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,100
implementation of style components is

371
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,670
massively complicated by the

372
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,560
fact that it does nothing but for me

373
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,810
it's really worth it because it makes it

374
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,020
easier to bring the same knowledge and

375
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:28,380
skills across into this new place so the

376
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,000
other half of style component is the

377
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,560
fact that this is JavaScript these are

378
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,350
components these do work like react

379
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,260
components and so we have different ways

380
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,540
of solving the same challenges that

381
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,670
every UI system has for style components

382
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,940
which using props so a button example

383
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,680
and if you're not familiar with react

384
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,780
then button is the component and primary

385
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,550
is a prop in this case it's just a

386
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,990
boolean attribute we can use it by

387
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,300
defining our button to be a style button

388
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,000
and then using some sort of magic in

389
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,410
here we have this interpolation inside

390
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,940
the template string which is the dollar

391
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,200
squiggly bracket

392
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,180
all right this sort of syntax might look

393
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,370
familiar but again it is totally

394
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,320
standard JavaScript it's just new it's

395
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,780
just not commonly used and what we've

396
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,250
done here is we've inserted these two

397
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,340
functions to say that whatever depending

398
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,280
on the primary prop either have it white

399
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,740
on pale violet red or pale violet red on

400
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,680
white now you can use these

401
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
interpolations for anything they don't

402
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,320
have to be functions functions will get

403
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,430
run on every new prop

404
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,810
if you want to just use variables this

405
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,760
is the same way that you do it it's very

406
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,460
simple let mixing you know media queries

407
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,840
you can abstract them all and in fact

408
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,630
polished came out of the desire to get a

409
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,300
standard library for CSS basically that

410
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,690
worked in this little way so that when

411
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,100
you call this what you've done is you've

412
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,600
created one button without a primary

413
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,270
prop one button with one they generate

414
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,130
different CSS and they get different

415
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,140
class names attached and so then they

416
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,730
appear differently so the next more

417
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,490
advanced kind of feature is the idea of

418
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,890
theming right instead of having to only

419
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,200
change the display of something by

420
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,700
talking to it directly we can actually

421
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,740
set up an environment and then build

422
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,740
these components that respond to it

423
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,870
we can customize components and

424
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,319
distances my note and this is some code

425
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,929
to do that we have this component called

426
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:32,909
the theme provider and then you set up a

427
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:34,860
theme as an object which it could be

428
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,330
anything it'll get passed down but

429
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,799
basically in this case we've just set up

430
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,230
a key and value primary and pale violet

431
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,820
red these are Max's slides he loves

432
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,860
paler violet red I'm more of a papaya

433
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,120
whip kind of guy but yeah so that then

434
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,559
when you render it if you wrap it in

435
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,419
this theme provider then that data is

436
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:52,559
available to all of your style

437
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,510
components and that can really change

438
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,970
actually how what you think a component

439
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,720
is responsible for when you go to use it

440
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,100
again use one of these function

441
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,720
interpolations but this time you

442
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,630
actually read the primary value off the

443
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,440
theme off the props and then when that

444
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,390
button renders it'll come out pale

445
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,860
violet red if you want to change that

446
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,720
button in two different places you now

447
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,850
have another option rather than just

448
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,950
making a variant of that button you can

449
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,679
simply wrap it in a new theme here we

450
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,419
have two themes one with pearl violet

451
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,220
red one medium C green I do like that

452
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,500
color actually and then when you wrap it

453
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,289
in those two themes they render

454
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:37,020
differently you can do this stuff really

455
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,520
really well with CSS variables as well

456
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,549
but the theming works through react

457
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:43,559
reaction mechanism so it sprouts a

458
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,640
support will go a lot further back

459
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,559
basically anything react supports okay

460
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,230
the key here is that these variables

461
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,720
passed down through the whole tree they

462
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,010
don't have to be directly beneath them

463
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,000
which means you can have components

464
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,179
adapt to their relationship between the

465
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,520
theme and the a and the component

466
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,340
without having to directly make them

467
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,120
talk to each other there can be

468
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,409
different files different parts of the

469
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:12,299
tree the final feature that I want to

470
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,000
talk about style components is about

471
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,490
react native so mark touched on this

472
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,919
which is the ability or the kind of new

473
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,370
ability or nascent ability for us web

474
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,440
developers to target platforms that

475
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,960
aren't the web something like react

476
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,840
native is designed to offer the same

477
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,750
mental model as react for the web but

478
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,300
and it even reimplemented like the

479
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,060
CSS flexbox spec in order to make it as

480
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,730
familiar as possible but open up these

481
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,900
new environments to so with style

482
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,180
components we support that by we wrote a

483
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,950
different back-end we wrote a back-end

484
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,900
that targets back native instead of

485
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,210
injecting CSS in the head it passes

486
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,340
those styled objects to the CSS to the

487
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,800
react native components it means you can

488
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,380
work with these things as you can keep

489
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,910
things as familiar as possible

490
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,010
you still name things in the same way

491
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,010
you still use the same syntax for CSS

492
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,690
although react native doesn't support

493
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,330
all of CSS so there are some times where

494
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,590
it is a little bit different but the

495
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,980
mental model is at the same when you

496
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,570
come to render it you're still just

497
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,190
rendering components and in fact this

498
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,700
component here has nothing react native

499
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,280
specific about it at all so potentially

500
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,590
you can have share some components that

501
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,050
do something but between web and native

502
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,760
they pick a different wrapper and a

503
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,200
different title because the wrapper and

504
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,090
react native is a view and the wrapper

505
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:44,190
on the web is a div say but again when

506
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,110
it runs it's just the same code as any

507
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,300
other react native code there's nothing

508
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,980
different about using Styles components

509
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,540
once it's running so I would love if you

510
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,300
would go and give this a try then hit me

511
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,220
or max or any of the other contributors

512
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,260
up on github or on Twitter and let us

513
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,940
know what you think there's actually a

514
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,440
bunch of new stuff that's about to go

515
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,840
into the library which is what I was

516
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,910
supposed to be working on yesterday

517
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,410
while max was preparing his talk but it

518
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,710
didn't quite work out like that it's

519
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,270
pretty this is pretty much all I have so

520
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,060
I just wanted to end by repeating this

521
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,130
assertion I think this stuff is really

522
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,350
ready I mean like you may not be sold on

523
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,170
style components but there's so many

524
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,790
other interesting approaches out there

525
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,380
there's something other different design

526
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,860
ideas being tested because you have this

527
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,680
more powerful platform and I wanted to

528
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,600
kind of at least give a little bit more

529
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,960
a wider view which is the point of all

530
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,450
of this work is to make things better

531
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,970
for everybody to try to make things

532
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,730
faster or more reliable or more

533
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,440
maintainable for your team

534
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,060
and potentially to make it easier for

535
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,490
new people to join the industry every

536
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,630
time that we can make things a little

537
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,620
bit better it helps everybody and so I'm

538
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,480
going to steal marks phrase for the end

539
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,480
because I really liked this this is one

540
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,310
of the core reasons that I felt

541
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,220
compelled to actually work on this stuff

542
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,490
interesting violin the first talk talked

543
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,660
about this historical separation between

544
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,600
CSS work and real development and it

545
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,430
made me think that I realized the only

546
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,490
way to understand all of the CSS J and J

547
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,320
s work is to realize that there was

548
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
never actually any of that difference

549
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,960
CSS and J's presupposes that CSS was an

550
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,180
engineering task all along and it's just

551
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,890
trying to bring the most powerful tool

552
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,440
to bear to fmjs

553
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,780
isn't an opposition to CSS knowledge

554
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,060
it's simply about allowing you to design

555
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,920
systems that enforce the kinds of

556
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,930
practices you think are important these

557
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,960
are the ones that I think are important

558
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,130
so in conclusion javascript really

559
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,780
powerful and it makes working with CSS

560
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,420
