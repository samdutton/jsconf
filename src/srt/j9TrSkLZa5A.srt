1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,760

so yes more often than not what somebody

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,910
says performance we tend to think about

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,560
speed but even though be not exactly the

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,739
same this substitution has a really good

5
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:25,970
background in forms of statistics for

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,500
example warmer dhadkan figured out that

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,599
one second of performance improvement

8
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,369
will give them two percent higher

9
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:34,550
conversions rate doesn't sound that much

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,879
but we are talking about company with

11
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:39,850
482 billion u.s. dollars in revenue and

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,140
let me tell you that two percent of this

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,989
number can buy you ten countries like

14
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:47,809
samoa islands that's quite a lot of

15
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,890
money another perspective on performance

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,179
recently designed by financial times

17
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:56,749
revealed that one second group in

18
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:59,359
performance will leave them without four

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,629
point six percent of conversions drop in

20
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,479
two seconds will leave them without five

21
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,670
percent of conversions and three seconds

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,610
of losing performance would steal almost

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,220
eight percent of conversions rate from

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,270
them that's a lot of users but probably

25
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,910
the best perspective on performance gave

26
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,290
Wikipedia last year when they were

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,210
searching for what performance engineer

28
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,070
they simply calculated the number of

29
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,560
readers that wikipedia has and put it

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,220
this way that by cutting page load by

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,890
100 milliseconds you would say Wikipedia

32
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,240
readers 617 years of weight annually

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,930
this is quite unexpected but very

34
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,520
illustrative case of what is performance

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,060
these statistics answers the question

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,570
why performance matters users buy more

37
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,970
users click more users download more and

38
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,740
that's pretty much all I wanted to tell

39
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,270
you about why performance better today

40
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,670
thank you well you didn't think that I

41
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,580
would leave just like that idea huh if

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,010
things are that simple why do we keep

43
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,769
talking about this performance thing and

44
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:18,280
if performance is solely about speed

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,800
then how do we explain this this is

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,730
statistics for gizmodo com and if you

47
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,870
get to the numbers well that's quite

48
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,410
shocking load time almost 20 seconds

49
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,930
visually complete 20 seconds and this is

50
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,040
on the cable connection there has to be

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,330
something wrong with these statistics

52
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,520
because gizmodo.com is the site that

53
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,010
during the last 30 days gained more than

54
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,640
33 million unique users and more than

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,239
112 million views ok statistics apart

56
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,680
let's see how this side behaves in the

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,470
real browser we type in URL and this

58
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,650
side is almost instantly here where are

59
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,880
those 20 seconds huh we'll get back to

60
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,320
this example a bit later but to those of

61
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,540
you who still think that performance is

62
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,000
about milliseconds kilobytes number of

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,640
servers sorry requests I haven't used

64
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,390
for you performance is not about

65
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,070
mathematics performance is about

66
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,160
perception and that's why today I'm not

67
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,769
going to tell you how to supercharge

68
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:41,750
superpower your page loading time by

69
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,780
using some fancy tools and techniques

70
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,269
like service worker because well nobody

71
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,730
can tell you this better than Jake hello

72
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm Jake hello Jake instead I will give

73
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,700
you a different perspective on what we

74
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,600
call performance and in this journey

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,940
today will employ the most powerful and

76
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,680
interesting tool that we have at our

77
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,620
disposal our brain have you ever had

78
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,810
this experience when you spend days

79
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,030
weeks working on your performance

80
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,160
optimization strategy you deploy

81
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,220
everything but neither your customer nor

82
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,510
your boss notices any difference you

83
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,180
know that times are lower you know that

84
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,190
performance optimization works but your

85
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,940
users

86
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,550
well your users just don't care in 19th

87
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,850
century German psychologist and that but

88
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,310
and later his student Gustav Fafnir

89
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,450
postulated a law that surprisingly

90
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,990
enough they called better faster law

91
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,710
this law defines a value called just

92
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,100
noticeable difference this is minimal

93
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,510
noticeable difference between two

94
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,880
stimuli like power difference in power

95
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,460
difference in power of light and time is

96
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,030
no exception to this law but experience

97
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,730
and research show that for the short

98
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,280
periods of time of up to 30 seconds and

99
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,540
these are other times that we are

100
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,160
particularly interested in when we talk

101
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,710
about the web development Weber

102
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,690
factional law can be replaced with

103
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,260
simple twenty percent rule why am I

104
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,840
talking about this and what does it have

105
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,460
to do with us web developers well let's

106
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,750
assume you have an event that your

107
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,430
customer is not satisfied with for

108
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,190
example page loading time so in order

109
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,240
for your customer to just notice the

110
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,680
difference after your performance

111
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,360
optimizations you make you have to make

112
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,720
your page loading at least twenty

113
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,620
percent faster anything below that will

114
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,620
make your users thinking oh well I don't

115
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,580
see any difference there is one catch

116
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,250
though we are talking about noticeable

117
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,160
difference and noticeable does not

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,770
necessarily mean meaningful if you still

119
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,630
think that twenty percent is more than

120
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,910
enough to spot the difference then I

121
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,910
have another example for you i will show

122
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,720
you two versions of the same page while

123
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,150
without optimization and one with

124
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,690
optimization your task is to spot which

125
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,190
one is faster are you ready are you

126
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:40,669
ready great site number one site number

127
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:45,530
two

128
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,190
who thinks that site number one was

129
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:54,220
faster okay who thinks that site number

130
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,600
two was faster wonderful who thinks that

131
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,950
this is matrix and this side doesn't

132
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:08,140
exist that's correct you see that there

133
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,940
are people who think that first option

134
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,710
is faster and there are people who think

135
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,440
that the second option is faster

136
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,170
technically there is no correct answer

137
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,440
but if we check the numbers the first

138
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,680
one was load was taking 1.6 seconds to

139
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,140
load and the second one used two seconds

140
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,230
to load and majority of you told that

141
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,700
second option is faster do you still

142
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,810
believe in absolute numbers in this

143
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,490
example we are talking not about 50

144
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,140
milliseconds difference not hundred

145
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,310
milliseconds difference we are talking

146
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,220
about 400 milliseconds of difference and

147
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,990
if you still think that we can blindly

148
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,480
rely on absolute numbers here is my

149
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,930
second example to you hello I'm Jake

150
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,420
sorry Jake I just couldn't resist but

151
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,850
for some tennis I hope that all of you

152
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,220
have wonderful content so far and my

153
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,440
voice doesn't make things worse even

154
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,840
though I deliberately delayed the audio

155
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,660
on this clip by 100 milliseconds just

156
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,390
won't notice anyway is our brain is

157
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,250
really good at synchronizing the

158
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,750
information it gets from five of our

159
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,500
senses into one consistent perception to

160
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,410
compensate for any delays unless the

161
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,350
delays become is proportionate and in

162
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,510
this case we experience this annoying

163
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:37,290
out of sync video your turn buddy yeah

164
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,719
so

165
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:48,019
thank you that is thank you our brain is

166
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:54,329
cheating us our brain does not allow us

167
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:58,230
to rely on absolute numbers now remember

168
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,089
all those days and weeks you've spent on

169
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,430
your performance optimization strategies

170
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,560
to just shave off 50 milliseconds your

171
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,300
users just don't notice of course one

172
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,610
can argue that it is milliseconds there

173
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,529
and 15 more seconds there in total can

174
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:16,529
give quite significant defaults

175
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,860
improvement and I do agree the problem

176
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,540
is that all of these performance

177
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,760
optimizations require development time

178
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,190
that your users might not be willing to

179
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,970
give you so far what I'm talking about

180
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,250
today is quite depressed if isn't their

181
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,620
time but you know what let's try to turn

182
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,500
our depression into the opportunities

183
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,269
since we're talking about performance

184
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:48,329
and perception let's figure out how our

185
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:50,760
brain perceives time and in particular

186
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,110
how brain perceives wait first of all

187
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,420
pretty much any event consists of two

188
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,260
phases active phase and passive phase at

189
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,660
the phase is characterized by mental

190
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,720
activity it can be mental activity of

191
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,790
any kind like pure mental activity or

192
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,589
mental activity related to some physical

193
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,230
activity but the point is your brain is

194
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,829
busy on the other hand the passive phase

195
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,620
is characterized by idling your brain is

196
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,230
no other option rather than just sit and

197
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,329
wait well you sit on brain wait using

198
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:31,319
some techniques we can manipulate this

199
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,420
balance between active phase and passive

200
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,149
phase in order to deliver different

201
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,519
perception to the user why do we need to

202
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,000
do this because when users complain to

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,269
you that something takes too long most

204
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,040
probably related to the passive phase

205
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,290
because active phase duties mental

206
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,510
activity is not considered away at all

207
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,029
by the brain so our task as the

208
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,139
developers is too

209
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,420
boys and techniques to reduce this

210
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,600
passive face by increasing the active

211
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,980
phase of the ways frankly I feel myself

212
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,230
a bit uncomfortable standing on this

213
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,069
stage and talking to such a brilliant

214
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:19,799
audience about such simple things but

215
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,919
when it comes to performance perception

216
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,819
and brain it is really that simple is

217
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,779
really that simple to trick our brain

218
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:32,910
let's get to some techniques there are

219
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,439
multiple techniques to manage this

220
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:35,790
balance between active and passive face

221
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,379
but of them boiled to two most common

222
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:42,209
ones the first one being pre-emptive

223
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,239
start let's assume you have an event

224
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:48,299
that you want to make your user perceive

225
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:51,779
as a shorter one in the pre-emptive

226
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,959
start technique in the beginning of our

227
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,929
event we put the active face so that

228
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:01,350
user perceives this wait this event as

229
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,919
the shorter one just this blue part

230
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,449
let's get to the example and I will

231
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:07,949
begin with the offline example that I

232
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:12,689
will never get tired of in 2009

233
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,939
adminstration of Houston Airport started

234
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:16,829
getting an enormous amount of complaints

235
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:20,549
on the lawn damage handling time well

236
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,379
administration decided to help

237
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,499
passengers and increase the number of

238
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:27,959
stuff on the baggage handling line that

239
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,059
we use the overall time of the baggage

240
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:32,519
handling 28 minutes everybody who

241
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,889
travels a lot knows that the time from

242
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,660
you from the moment you leave the plane

243
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,600
to the time you get your bag on the belt

244
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,529
eight minutes is really really low

245
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,049
surprisingly enough the administration

246
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:47,339
didn't notice any decrease in the

247
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,739
complaints so they started investigating

248
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,660
this case a bit deeper and they figured

249
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,939
out that indeed baggage handling time is

250
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,470
eight minutes but the problem is that

251
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,600
for an average person to get from the

252
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,399
plane to the baggage carousel it takes

253
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,709
only one minute the remaining seven

254
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,149
minutes the person just stands by the

255
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,189
carousel and waits for his back to show

256
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:07,130
up

257
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,280
employing the perception management

258
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,220
technique administration came up with a

259
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,990
very simple trivial but nevertheless

260
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,050
very effective solution what they did

261
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,610
they just started routing the arrival

262
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,150
planes to the gates further from the

263
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,220
baggage carousel that led to the

264
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,380
situation when an average person now

265
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,840
needed six minutes to get from the plane

266
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,360
to the baggage carousel and only two

267
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,510
minutes just stand and wait so six

268
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,110
minutes of active way and only two

269
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,170
minutes of passive way guess what the

270
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,630
number of complaints drop to zero

271
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,000
another example Mobile Safari on iOS I

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,090
guess this feature called blue top hits

273
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,530
that is enabled by default in the iOS

274
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:58,310
how it works so you open the browser you

275
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,830
start typing the URL there are two

276
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,390
things to note here first one title top

277
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,030
hit so based on your history on the

278
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,380
history of your visits it's probably

279
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,720
tries to guess which side you want to

280
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,020
visit now quite trivial operation but

281
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,050
there is another thing to note here the

282
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,930
network activity so what happens in this

283
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,170
moment once the party shows you the top

284
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,780
heat side in the background it also

285
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,080
tries to preload this site for you at

286
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,940
the same time you type in URL so that

287
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,460
when you're done with the URL the site

288
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,980
is almost instantly here you don't spend

289
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,290
time waiting for all the assets to be

290
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,200
downloaded another example of

291
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,730
pre-emptive star technique is the site

292
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,290
that I'm working with you never know and

293
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,300
one of the things that we do good is

294
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,380
selling the main names obviously enough

295
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,350
there has to be the search page for the

296
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,870
domains and it works as any other domain

297
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,870
search page in the wild users just type

298
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,920
in the domain name click go and they get

299
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,890
the results with the domains the point

300
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,980
is that to get to build these three of

301
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,280
domains we need to make an API call that

302
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,589
for some technical reasons cannot be

303
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,060
stored on the client and cannot be

304
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,740
cashed we have different prices

305
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,750
different till these and it all

306
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,510
dynamic and this API call is not the

307
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,880
fastest call in the world nevertheless

308
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,360
we don't feel like our users have to be

309
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,110
penalized for this so we start making

310
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,630
the API call and pre-loading all the

311
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,390
results and pre building the Dom tree at

312
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,460
the moment the user hits the search page

313
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,490
so user comes to the search page types

314
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,950
in the domain name and we already have

315
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,110
all the don't rebuilt in the background

316
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,320
so far so good but there are moments

317
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,270
when users can search for the domain

318
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,940
from another side sorry from another

319
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,820
page where he didn't hit the search page

320
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,620
obviously enough he doesn't have the

321
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,250
search assets yet like for example on

322
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,020
the front page if you load the front

323
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,690
page you check a network tab and you see

324
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,700
that there are no search related assets

325
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,140
download it because you're not on the

326
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,060
search page but let's see what happens

327
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,320
when the user focuses on the search

328
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,840
field once the user is focused in the

329
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,580
search field we by default we assume

330
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,590
that the next step the next page he will

331
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,420
hit will be the search results page

332
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,940
that's why we needed we start

333
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,640
downloading the search assets make the

334
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,100
API call and start rebuilding the Dom

335
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,170
tree right here on the front page before

336
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,339
user hits the Go button to deliver these

337
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,170
search results as soon as possible when

338
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,150
he gets to the search page this is about

339
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,310
preemptive star technique another one is

340
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,520
called early completion where we have

341
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,500
the same event that we want user to

342
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,780
perceive a shorter one but this time we

343
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,310
put active phase at the end of the event

344
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,800
most probably the most obvious examples

345
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,630
of this technique is pretty much any

346
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,490
video streaming services like YouTube

347
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,890
for example it all starts with a passive

348
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,220
phase users get to this side click the

349
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,319
play button and they wait for the video

350
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,150
to be downloaded so the original event

351
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,699
is full video to be downloaded but users

352
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,000
do not wait until the full video gets to

353
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,100
their browser in the passive face all

354
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,750
the time once the first chunk of the

355
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,760
video possible for viewing is downloaded

356
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,940
the video begins and user is immediately

357
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,340
triggered into the active phase because

358
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,860
his brain is busy with mental activity

359
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,870
analyzing the visual information on his

360
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,370
screen even though the original event

361
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,540
keeps going in the background let's get

362
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,790
to our gizmodo example and see whether

363
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,280
where do they hide this 20 seconds that

364
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,010
we lost if you check the film strip of

365
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,260
rendering process of this side we will

366
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,360
notice that gizmodo starts rendering the

367
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,460
elements as soon as 1.5 seconds actually

368
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,190
a bit earlier but you're to the scale

369
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,960
here and this is the critical moment up

370
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,020
until their users are in the passive

371
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,300
phase they have not no other option

372
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,620
rather than just wait but once the side

373
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,860
starts rendering the things the brain is

374
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,570
triggered into the mental activity this

375
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,940
means that user is in active phase and

376
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,720
he doesn't mind and he doesn't care how

377
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,550
long does it take after this point

378
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,180
whether it's 30 seconds 40 seconds to

379
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,340
load the rest of the site he already has

380
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,350
information to consume he can start

381
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:52,910
reading today do not get me wrong i do

382
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:59,840
not advocate for ignoring the the

383
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,460
industrial standards I just tell you

384
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,680
that when users are in passive face

385
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,920
they're very sad seriously we are we all

386
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,830
hate waiting and this is the sweet spot

387
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,670
where we want to put our users as soon

388
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,600
as possible and as i said i do not

389
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
advocate for ignoring industry standards

390
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,660
industry advices on absolute numbers and

391
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,210
all the things because frankly all even

392
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,030
though i'm telling about perception all

393
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,830
these perception techniques are driven

394
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,160
with technical means so in order to

395
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,820
employ all of this we still have to load

396
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,669
our assets as synchronously we should

397
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:49,100
block rendering we should still keep

398
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,950
compressing oh here comes a sink of

399
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,639
course async comes whenever it wants we

400
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:58,429
should keep word using workers like

401
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:04,039
service workers hi Jake we should keep

402
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:08,600
using resource hints to preload prefetch

403
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,519
resources that we will need on other

404
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,869
pages of our side but instead what I'm

405
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:20,239
advocating for today is next time you're

406
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,590
working on your performance optimization

407
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,590
strategy to use the most powerful and

408
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,690
interesting tool available at our

409
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,109
disposal being our brain and ask

410
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:33,169
yourself a question is there any other

411
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:39,529
way to do this and I couldn't finish my

412
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,859
talk better than the quote by Apple in

413
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:46,159
their basic performance tips that's as

414
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,399
the perception of performance is just as

415
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:52,999
effective as actual performance in many

416
00:20:52,999 --> 00:21:03,590
cases thank you yes I hope I hope my

417
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,749
talk didn't keep you in passive wait but

418
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:07,909
we are looking forward to the active

419
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:11,749
phase that is being lunch so that

420
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:13,970
question disposed because I cuz I got a

421
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,239
microphone okay so when you're which you

422
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:20,090
show content on the screen that is isn't

423
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,559
currently active with JavaScript like

424
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,659
would you add stuff visually that isn't

425
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,820
yet clickable and how do you sort of

426
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,279
cope with that sort of thing so these

427
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,309
stuff that is not clickable is probably

428
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:33,169
it depends on the amount of this stuff

429
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:34,759
if this is the only one button on the

430
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,739
screen obviously users will try to click

431
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:38,179
it and will be disappointed today's I'm

432
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:40,299
clickable but if you have another

433
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,919
information to consume to give user to

434
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:45,950
consume then I think that it's totally

435
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,440
fine to add this element uncle' well

436
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,059
maybe with some tool tip or something

437
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,509
that says that yeah okay some more thing

438
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:56,960
is coming but probably you should you

439
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,549
know I when it comes to performance

440
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,559
every case is quite separate so

441
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,019
you have to analyze and you have user

442
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,509
testing whether it works for them or not

443
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:08,720
but it I would I would not mind putting

444
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,850
the unbelievable element on the screen

445
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,710
as soon as possible as long as the

446
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,960
functionality comes make sense thank you

447
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,330
very much so yes this now takes it to

448
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,730
lunch time lunch is just upstairs if you
