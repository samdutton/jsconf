00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:14,400

reject hi everyone I'm really excited to

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,770
be here talking to you I've come all the

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,550
way from Melbourne Australia so today

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,630
what I'm going to talk to you about is

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,689
how I use the browser to do science I'm

6
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,880
going to talk about how I use it to do

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,099
my research which involves simulating

8
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,610
brain cells but I'm also going to talk

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,190
sort of more generally about my

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,860
experiences and thoughts relating to

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,329
sort of the crossroads between science

12
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,530
and web development but first I'm going

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,760
to tell you to origin stories and like

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,379
all good origin stories both of these

15
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,690
involve science so the first one I think

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,020
probably most you are familiar with is

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,660
it's the birth of the web so the web was

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,970
created in the late 1980s by Tim

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,570
berners-lee at CERN and it was created

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,920
to help scientists do science it was so

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,420
the problem that was happening was that

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,950
there were all these particle physicists

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,990
who would travel discern to do their

24
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,580
experiments on the facilities there and

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,009
they needed a better way to share and

26
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,170
access their data when they go back to

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,220
their home home laboratories so as Tim

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,560
berners-lee put it in those days there

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,030
was different information on different

30
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,890
computers and you'd have to log on to

31
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,090
these different computers and often have

32
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,579
to learn a new program to get at the

33
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,909
data so often it was just easier to to

34
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,270
meet with the people um over a coffee or

35
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,009
something like that and so he saw the

36
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:55,290
web as a way to solve these problems and

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,600
so shortly after that the web spun out

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,159
of the scientific community and became

39
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,600
what it is today now the second origin

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,549
story I'm pretty confident not many

41
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,220
people here will know about it's the

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,780
story of how I came to be speaking here

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,740
today

44
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,230
so like many of you and as Ronald sort

45
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,730
of pointed out earlier a lot of people

46
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,650
come from a different area and I'm no

47
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,410
exception my background is in sort of

48
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,450
mathematics and engineering and then

49
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,570
went into modeling brain systems trying

50
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,950
to understand how they worked much stand

51
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,560
here so and I was so interested in that

52
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,200
that I decided to do a PhD in it which I

53
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,940
don't recommend people get into

54
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,390
half-heartedly PhDs are hard and it's

55
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,620
not because you need to be super smart

56
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,660
or anything like that it's hard because

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,040
you have to stay interested in a

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,500
particular topic for a long time you

59
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,760
have to be the one driving it forward

60
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,880
and motivating it you will probably be

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,440
the only one who really fully knows

62
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,110
what's going on and really cares you

63
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,590
know if you're successful and this needs

64
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,810
to be the case for years and because of

65
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,670
this the end of a PhD is often a time of

66
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,590
stress disillusionment and

67
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,110
procrastination so I didn't make a

68
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,600
jacket out of tax receipts the way I

69
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,320
procrastinated was instead teaching

70
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,459
myself Ruby on Rails and so I'd like to

71
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,140
help me learn i decided to build a

72
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,180
project and so actually built a rhyming

73
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,360
dictionary called any rom-com so us can

74
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,090
check that out if you want and I taught

75
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,830
myself JavaScript as well to try and

76
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,209
make sort of a nice interface for how

77
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,670
you could you know make a particular

78
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,980
kind of rhyme that you wanted so I

79
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,290
learned angular for that and I found

80
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,450
myself really enjoying doing this I was

81
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,549
really satisfying and it's not just

82
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:52,110
because i had a thesis but I didn't want

83
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,930
to ride but at this point I did

84
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,880
eventually hand in my thesis and I got a

85
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,989
job working for IBM Research Australia

86
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:05,000
still doing euro science research

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,850
believe it or not but at this point I

88
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,900
now had a taste for for what for what

89
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,730
the web could do and and I now knew

90
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,989
about this whole other world of cool

91
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,600
stuff and and maybe this could help with

92
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,470
my research so before I go any further

93
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,419
I'll give you some context to my

94
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,430
research

95
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,610
so this is the human brain well it's a

96
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,830
plastic model of human brain it

97
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,720
represents this hunk of meat that sits

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,210
in our head that is somehow responsible

99
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,699
for all our memories emotions and

100
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,759
decisions our sense of self and our

101
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,169
ability to comprehend the world it takes

102
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,340
information from our senses from our

103
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,949
eyes our ears and our fingertips and

104
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:54,110
somehow members this and we can then use

105
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,580
this information to to speak to move but

106
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,139
how it does all of this is largely a

107
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,949
mystery and understanding this is sort

108
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:05,900
of the map the fundamental goal of

109
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,930
neuroscience what we do know however is

110
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,240
that the brain is made up of a large

111
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,599
number of cells called neurons in the

112
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:16,370
human brain they're approximately 86

113
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,800
billion neurons and each one of these

114
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,660
forms 10,000 connections to its

115
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,740
neighbors and it's this dense network of

116
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,340
neurons that scientists believe is what

117
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,659
sort of gives rise to the brains

118
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:32,870
abilities so if we now just focusing on

119
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,210
a single neuron we see it has sort of

120
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,070
this fairly common structure it has

121
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,889
incoming fibers called dendrites and

122
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,139
which carry signal to carry a signal to

123
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,500
the cell body called the soma and

124
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,849
there's an outgoing fiber called an axon

125
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:49,970
which branches and forms connections to

126
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:56,419
the dendrites of other neurons um but

127
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:57,830
despite this basic structure there

128
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,740
exists a large variety of shapes and

129
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,630
morphologies for these neurons depending

130
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,070
on where in the brain our and what type

131
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,060
of neuron now and luckily

132
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,310
experimentalists have there's an online

133
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,470
database where you can go through these

134
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,669
different types of of morphologies so

135
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,740
experimentalist what they've done is

136
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,190
they've taken brain tissue they've

137
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,340
stained neurons with fluorescent dyes

138
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,830
they've been taken many many microscope

139
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,979
images at different depths what they've

140
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:33,740
been done is carefully traced well their

141
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,360
graduate students have carefully traced

142
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,990
through these microscope images in order

143
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,180
to

144
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,949
reconstruct like the 3d information of

145
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,680
the neuron and so you can see here are

146
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,330
some images of these types of neurons so

147
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,180
these are just sort of static images but

148
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,300
what the data actually looks like is a

149
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,240
text file so each point in here is a

150
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,340
sort of a point on the neuron starting

151
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
with the cell body is the first point

152
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,520
each of the points has an ID it has a

153
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,150
type so if it's a dendrite or an axon

154
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,150
has XYZ coordinates and has a radius so

155
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,030
it gives the thickness of the fiber and

156
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,160
it has its like parent point so the

157
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,750
point going back towards the cell body

158
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,210
and in this way it describes like a tree

159
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,960
structure which is what a neuron is so

160
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,840
very often in science it's it's

161
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,030
invaluable to have sort of a visual way

162
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,160
of looking at your data and this is a

163
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,280
prime example because it's very hard to

164
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,500
look at this and understand what's going

165
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,090
on like what does this neuron look like

166
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,190
and so I decided to build something that

167
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,440
would help me look at this so there they

168
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,810
were existing Java applets and that sort

169
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,409
of thing to try and visualize this but I

170
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,820
wanted to build my own I wanted to use

171
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,710
three jess to build something that I

172
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,159
could use so that's what our demo to you

173
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,039
now so this is kind of the very basic

174
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,669
interface I made where I can select one

175
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:03,840
of these text files that I was just

176
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,169
showing you and it loads up here and we

177
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:10,440
can zoom in and then rotate and so this

178
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,820
one's a little bit flat but we can see

179
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,840
it has a three-dimensional structure and

180
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,360
also i can click on points with in here

181
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,849
and see see the data that generated that

182
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,270
so i can see what type of fiber it is i

183
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,300
can see the coordinates of it and i can

184
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,979
see its ID so i can link it back to the

185
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:36,539
data so this is nice I've got like a

186
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:42,040
useful tool to help me do my research

187
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,130
but let's put that aside for the moment

188
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,540
and come back to the problems in science

189
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,340
that Tim berners-lee was trying to solve

190
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,750
with the web how we doing today how is

191
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,530
how a science going well the web has

192
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,920
helped scientific research a lot we can

193
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,990
now easily browse through scientific

194
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,090
publications from researchers around the

195
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,450
world and in addition to these reports

196
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,790
researchers can share and publish their

197
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,870
data and code for others to use I can

198
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,400
point to a number of websites just in

199
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,570
neuroscience such as neuromorphic org

200
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,280
with carefully curated data sets that

201
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,780
for other people to use and online you

202
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,060
can find the software that they've used

203
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,350
to analyze the data or to run

204
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,180
simulations and you can download this

205
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,220
and its documentation and forums around

206
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,220
how to use it but is this really that

207
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,450
different to how things were before the

208
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,780
web I mean it is we can now trivially

209
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,960
share information biet reports data or

210
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,070
code but all three of these to actually

211
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,780
use and understand require a high level

212
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,110
of technical understanding or technical

213
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,020
expertise what if instead we started

214
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,450
using and sharing interactive tools to

215
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,920
help visualize like fully visualize data

216
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,510
sets interactively without needing to

217
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,770
install anything what if we could share

218
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,300
interactive tools for performing

219
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,530
simulations that could be run anywhere

220
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,670
this I think would be a more complete

221
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,350
solution to the problems that Tim

222
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,040
berners-lee saw and researchers want to

223
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,270
be able to to share their results this

224
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,740
helps them make an impact in the field

225
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,270
and allows other people to build on what

226
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,970
they've done they just haven't had good

227
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,170
ways of doing this when there was

228
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,820
specialized software that was required

229
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,600
for simulation or visualization however

230
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
this is starting to change so recent

231
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,870
developments in browser technologies

232
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,990
like WebGL for instance and new

233
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,020
JavaScript libraries such as 3gs and

234
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,570
d3.js make the browser a compelling

235
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,970
place to build

236
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,939
interactive useful visual scientific

237
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:03,869
tools I'd say it's easier now to create

238
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:06,809
sort of an interactive scientific tool

239
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:11,220
in a browser than it is natively and

240
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,759
it's much more easily shared so let's

241
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,339
get back to me for for a minute I was

242
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,910
now able to visualize a 3d structure and

243
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,420
morphology of neurons but so what what I

244
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,100
actually want to do is to understand how

245
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,779
this neuron works how it behaves and how

246
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,269
when you connect a whole bunch of these

247
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:36,809
neurons up to form a network how this

248
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:39,600
ultimately leads to us to our thoughts

249
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,490
and memories and behavior so let's go

250
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,209
back to a second to our neuron diagram

251
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:50,670
so neurons in the brain communicate with

252
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,170
each other by sending burst of

253
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,439
electricity called spikes they each

254
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:57,689
receive spikes from other neurons fire

255
00:11:57,689 --> 00:12:00,360
connections called synapses so there's

256
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,410
one there so when a neuron fires it

257
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,620
sends its signal out along an axon to

258
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,370
the end of the axon to the signups where

259
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,749
the synapse is made on to the dendrite

260
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,240
of another neuron and it excites our

261
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,999
this dendrite and we get a small current

262
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:19,920
being generated in the dendrite that

263
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,220
travels down to the cell body and if we

264
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,749
get enough of these arriving at the same

265
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:27,329
time in the cell body and neuron gets

266
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,879
excited past a threshold point where it

267
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,769
generates its own spike its own burst of

268
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:33,959
electricity which it sends out along

269
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,949
attacks on to other neurons and often

270
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:40,499
this whole setup is recreated in

271
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:44,339
experiments artificially by positioning

272
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,809
and electrode near the dendrite and

273
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:49,049
injecting current into the cell and it

274
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:50,549
was by doing these sort of experiments

275
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:52,170
that two English scientists back in the

276
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,970
1950s developed a model of how in your

277
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,379
own works so these in experiments

278
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,839
involved so this sorry to a mention

279
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,069
their names Hodgkin and Huxley were the

280
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,829
two English scientist and they did these

281
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,390
experiments by

282
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,640
using stimulating electrodes like this

283
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,560
one and also recording electrodes to see

284
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,590
what the neuron was doing the neuron

285
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,870
they used was the squid giant axon well

286
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,040
that was that was the accident of the

287
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,810
neuron they used which is

288
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,670
disappointingly a normal-sized squid

289
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,420
that has this very large neuron in it

290
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,510
and it was the size of this neuron that

291
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,800
allowed them to do these experiments

292
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,570
even back in the 1950s with the

293
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,960
technology they had and so the

294
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,360
understanding they got from this in the

295
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,090
model they developed off in your on it

296
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,830
one than the Nobel Prize which they

297
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,510
shared with another researcher John

298
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,580
Eccles who is actually also from

299
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,500
Melbourne like me so I don't have any

300
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,870
code to show today so instead what I'm

301
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,360
going to show is some equations so the

302
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,740
model they develop the mathematical

303
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,900
model developed is is encompassed by

304
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,750
these these set of equations and even

305
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,120
today this is sort of this type of

306
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
equations are the main ones used to

307
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,820
model single neurons and this is the

308
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,620
sort of thing I use so in my models a

309
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,990
neuron gets divided up into small little

310
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,270
segments and in each one of those this

311
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,580
set of equation dictates how the voltage

312
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:32,100
changes over time

313
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,790
so what I wanted to be able to do was

314
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,460
build a visual tool for constructing

315
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,380
models of neurons and configuring models

316
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,390
in neurons for example I wanted to be

317
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,160
able to choose where I was going to

318
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,080
inject current into the neuron and then

319
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,850
look at where in the neuron got excited

320
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,589
or I might want to look at adding

321
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:50,149
synaptic inputs from other neurons and

322
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:53,990
look at how the neuron responded so i

323
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,730
started building an interface to let me

324
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,010
do this this was something i spent a

325
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,260
decent portion of the last year working

326
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,300
on and it's something that I'm really

327
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,220
proud of my baby so I'm now going to

328
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,290
demonstrate the interface the first

329
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,180
thing I'm going to show you is how it

330
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,589
can be used to sort of set up a

331
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,540
simulation exactly how you want it so

332
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,029
set up the inputs and then going to show

333
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:20,390
you how it can be used to visualize the

334
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,740
outputs and see what happened in the

335
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,020
simulation so I'll show you a completed

336
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,570
simulation so jumping back to Chrome so

337
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,220
this is the interface it's it's pretty

338
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,330
similar to the one I showed you before

339
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,380
you can rotate and zoom in I've now got

340
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,970
a sphere for the cell body which sort of

341
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,630
helps a bit so you can see where that is

342
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,430
one difference now though is I can click

343
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,490
on a section of the neuron and look at

344
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,130
the properties for that section so I can

345
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,080
look at the sort of Jim geometric

346
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,480
properties like XYZ and are but I could

347
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,100
also look at I can also look at the

348
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,870
actual electrical properties of the

349
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,300
tissue so things like channel

350
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,940
conductances and that sort of thing and

351
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,920
so I can select for instance multiple

352
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,320
compartments and I can override the

353
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,400
default value for these and set it to be

354
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,670
something a bit smaller than it was and

355
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,180
I can then go and color the neuron by

356
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,130
this property so this is this is the

357
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,930
sodium channel density so how many

358
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,550
sodium channels are in this part of the

359
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,290
neuron and this is very important for

360
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,339
how in your own sort of behaves

361
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,910
electrically so here we can now see for

362
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,110
different parts of the neuron we've got

363
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,529
different channel densities so when that

364
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,760
where there's the most channels is in

365
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,850
the soma and along the axon we've got

366
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,000
less in the dendrites so flying and then

367
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,230
in this section we

368
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,540
made their be far fewer sodium channels

369
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,000
so it's in dark blue and we can also

370
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,690
color the neuron by by its radius so at

371
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,720
my visualization is just a skeleton

372
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,200
there's no actual volumes but here we

373
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,600
can see that this neuron has some sort

374
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,910
of thicker branch sort of going

375
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,100
vertically through it and thinner

376
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,450
branches coming out switching back to

377
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,210
that so I can also choose a compartment

378
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,230
within the neuron to inject current so i

379
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,810
can add an electrode here and i can

380
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,660
choose when I want to inject the can't

381
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,910
for how long the current gets injected

382
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,380
and the size of the current and so in

383
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,310
this way I can sort of set up a

384
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,710
simulation run that and then look at how

385
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,770
so let's now look at this is a similar

386
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,010
one I'd set up previously and run so now

387
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,030
i can click on a compartment and i can

388
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,920
visualize how the voltage change changes

389
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,670
over time through the simulation so down

390
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,080
here i've built this little graph using

391
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,040
d3 and i can also i can color the neuron

392
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,310
by by the voltage so i can now see the

393
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,900
voltage at any point within the neuron

394
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,510
over time so we can play forward through

395
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:10,890
this like a movie i can zoom in on this

396
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,820
and we should see it getting current

397
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,190
being injected here and the neuron gets

398
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,990
enough current to produce an action

399
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,360
potential a spike that travels out along

400
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,620
the axon and so this is really really

401
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,900
useful to me i can and i can look at

402
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:35,530
graphs from different parts

403
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,820
thank you so yeah this is a really

404
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,560
useful tool and I plan to start using it

405
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,390
for my own research to to understand how

406
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,880
in your own works what was going to it

407
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,870
yeah so I don't know this is an example

408
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,760
I guess a really accessible tool for

409
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,430
helping visualize what you're doing for

410
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,400
making making these sort of simulations

411
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,930
are like very visual so set up so what

412
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,830
have I learned from this well I've

413
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,230
learned that the web has has a lot to

414
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,350
offer science and the scientific

415
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,850
community and I'd really like to see a

416
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,740
much larger crossover between these two

417
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,360
communities I think there's a lot they

418
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,480
can learn from each other and to this

419
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,850
end a friend of mine Isabel and I have

420
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,560
been developing a course for teaching

421
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,370
researchers in the scientific community

422
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,950
teaching them sort of web skills and

423
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:39,800
teaching them to use d3.js so here's

424
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,780
yeah I'll suppose padova cool so here's

425
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,390
a tweet from Isabel about about the

426
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,310
course material we developed so we

427
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,160
developed it on github so that other

428
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,540
people could borrow this material and

429
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,750
use themselves and in fact before we had

430
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,700
the chance to teach this to researchers

431
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,650
at our University someone beat us to it

432
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:06,360
they in fact ordered at CERN so at CERN

433
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,270
as part of some summer student web fest

434
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,630
they told our materials around using d3

435
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,630
to visualize your data which is really

436
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:23,010
exciting we couldn't believe it so I've

437
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,330
shown you a visual tool for a vigil

438
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,190
browser based tool for configuring

439
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,070
simulation inputs and visualizing

440
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,410
simulation outputs but the browser is

441
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,650
sort of only half of the web what we

442
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,130
wanted to do was once we'd set up a

443
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,610
simulation actually then stay in the

444
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,170
browser and have that simulation get run

445
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,300
in the cloud

446
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,070
and then pull back the data from that

447
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,990
simulation and stay so still in the

448
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,350
browser seamlessly go through that whole

449
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,860
transition this would mean so

450
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,510
researchers being able to use this tool

451
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,710
mean they now no longer have to worry

452
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,290
about moving around files or setting up

453
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,440
or installing any software so this was

454
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,210
really exciting that's what I wanted to

455
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,660
do so this is the web app sort of i'm

456
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:18,020
using now i needed to be able to

457
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,820
orchestrate simulations and have them

458
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,560
store their outputs in the cloud where

459
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,040
they could be accessed from the browser

460
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,920
but this is not an easy thing this is

461
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,100
not trivial at least it wasn't for me

462
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,690
luckily though I work with a lot of

463
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,760
really amazing people who who I could

464
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,880
learn from him who could teach me also

465
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,950
the other benefits working at IBM is

466
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,750
they're acquiring all the companies that

467
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,690
do all this useful cloud technologies so

468
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,800
I could make use of that so I'm

469
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,870
deploying my app using an IBM product

470
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,210
called bluemix which is cloud foundry

471
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,580
but it also lets you connect in other

472
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,340
services so i connect to database to

473
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,870
keep track of my simulations keep track

474
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,400
of the data and what state they're in

475
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,010
whether they're still running but i need

476
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,900
to actually run their simulations so i

477
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,990
need to run these on virtual machines in

478
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,070
the cloud and as these runs so these the

479
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,690
simulations are actually run in c++

480
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,360
inside dr. containers and as they run

481
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,470
they need somewhere to put their data

482
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,630
somewhere the browser can get up so I

483
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,540
use object storage for this in both the

484
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,130
virtual machines and object storage are

485
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,080
within something another IBM product

486
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,470
called called softlayer another recent

487
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:38,340
acquisition so let's now see all of this

488
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:46,280
in action so here we were visualizing

489
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,050
visualizing Apple to this simulation we

490
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,750
can actually go back and so here I've

491
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,460
got a list of other simulations that

492
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,610
existed so we were in here so the green

493
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,830
simulations are ones that have been

494
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,710
completed have been finished

495
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,299
in yellow our simulations that we're

496
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,240
just setting up and haven't yet run and

497
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,159
so I can make a copy of this one we were

498
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,220
just in so it creates a new one over

499
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,740
here and then we go in and so we've got

500
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,970
this simulation we're just injecting

501
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,710
current at one point so we can now go

502
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,200
and modify this we might want to add

503
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,679
current in it here as well maybe we want

504
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,730
to do that after 90 milliseconds we can

505
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:36,000
also inject some current here maybe this

506
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,100
is a 60 and actually this one here I'm

507
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,770
gonna make it a bit stronger and so what

508
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,840
we can do now is up the top here i can

509
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,230
click a button called simulate and the

510
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,490
state of the jobs changes to running so

511
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,110
what's happening here is our web app is

512
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,470
sending the job off 22 softlayer to the

513
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,929
vm in software the c++ code is starting

514
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:07,950
up inside the docker container and as

515
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,450
it's running it will put its data in

516
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,279
object storage where the browser can

517
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,610
download it as it's running so this was

518
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,929
really cool we can actually watch the

519
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:19,200
simulation as it's going on now full

520
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,669
disclosure I didn't write the superloft

521
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:25,020
passcode my boss actually did he kind of

522
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,750
insisted he's written this sort of code

523
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,690
to model how current flows through a

524
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,549
neuron I think this might be his fifth

525
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:35,850
time so he thought he knew exactly how

526
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,960
it should be done he'd learned from all

527
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,750
his mistakes but the thing is this is

528
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,340
the first time that you can actually see

529
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,380
what's going on as the simulation is

530
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,399
running so if we click over here we can

531
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,049
see that some of the results have

532
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:52,679
already downloaded and we can color the

533
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:54,570
neuron by these oak like we wear before

534
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,779
I mean so this line here where you can

535
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,279
see it stops that's where the simulation

536
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,820
is up to so we can jump back and we can

537
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:09,510
play forward through here so being able

538
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,130
to watch this as it's running and and

539
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,620
this is all online so other researchers

540
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,460
can go on and see the models that you

541
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,820
created see the simulations you've run

542
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,470
collaborators now have a like a really

543
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,330
easy way to share their results and

544
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,480
build upon what each other have done

545
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,960
they don't have to worry about

546
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,250
installing software they don't have to

547
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,909
worry about transferring files so I see

548
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:32,679
this as an amazing way for collaboration

549
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:37,840
to occur and moreover it's an example of

550
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,179
a super accessible way of sharing

551
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:42,159
scientific findings that would otherwise

552
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,120
require specialized software and and to

553
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,730
do simulation and visualization and this

554
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,539
is much more accessible like people in

555
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:53,890
different fields or even the general

556
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,960
public can look at this and and have a

557
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,039
much better understanding of what's

558
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,090
going on and then if they read a journal

559
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,110
paper so I see this is something that

560
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,820
science really needs I see it as like

561
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:11,919
the future of science so as the last

562
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,590
thing so I'm used to giving academic

563
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,330
talks and at the end of an academic talk

564
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,220
there's always an acknowledgment slide

565
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,399
so that's what I've done there's a

566
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:22,630
number of people I'd like to thank the

567
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,500
first person is Glenn Madden so he's the

568
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,720
one that initially got me into into into

569
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,320
the web into web development and he

570
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,539
continues to be a mentor around anything

571
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:38,710
web-related the second person is Isabel

572
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,260
Carol Cornick so she's the one that I

573
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,220
built those d3 course materials with and

574
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,220
she also provides an endless source of

575
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,990
feedback for this project and for other

576
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,230
projects I like to thank Ben Schwartz

577
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:58,450
and Carolina sure they were the ones

578
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,890
that encouraged me to actually submit to

579
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,440
this conference an international

580
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,760
JavaScript conference which is not

581
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,440
something i think i would have thought

582
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,010
of otherwise i'd like to thank IBM

583
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,649
research and in particular my manager

584
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:16,360
who wrote that c++ code for for

585
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,039
encouraging me and seeing the value in

586
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,110
this work and also all the other amazing

587
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,720
people i work with that IBM who taught

588
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,279
me a lot of the skills I've needed to do

589
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,159
this lastly I'd like to thank the

590
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:28,840
organizers of rejecters

591
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,090
for for inviting me and for being

592
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:34,630
awesome and all of you so thanks for
