00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,990

hello everyone thank you for voting and

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,210
also thank you for coming and today

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,779
we're talking about hype and so maybe as

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,330
a front-end developer you already

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,740
experienced that we are living in a hype

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,529
driven development environment hyper-v

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,539
development is one of the things but

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,220
also there's the fear of missing out

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,329
because there bazillion new frameworks

10
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,309
coming out every day and you don't know

11
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,380
like what should I learn what should I

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,559
follow what should I need to apply what

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,510
do I have to apply what do I have to

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,840
learn and so at some point we start kind

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,059
of following just a few people on

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,820
Twitter because I don't know maybe we

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,770
heard them talking in one of the

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,780
conferences or we read a really cool

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,510
medium article from them and so we are

20
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,289
now following these people but somehow

21
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,510
this is just a very small group of

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,270
people and so we kind of end up in a

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,000
bubble because these people follow each

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,939
other and so we maybe don't hear others

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,850
people opinions anymore and maybe we

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,729
even start taking everything for granted

27
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,060
the people we follow safe so let me

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,030
introduce you to the motto of the high

29
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,880
royal society back in the day there was

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,180
a group dedicated to science and back in

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,790
the day it was very common that the word

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,820
of a person that was like a lord or I

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,759
don't know somebody who had money was

34
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,180
yeah here louder and better and their

35
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,399
opinion mattered more to people then

36
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,310
let's say from a poor monk or some other

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,770
worker on the street and so the high

38
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,920
royal society the British Royal Society

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,130
had one motto and they call it unison

40
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,070
bah bah it's Latin and that means don't

41
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,540
take word for granted or and so that

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,119
means that we should listen to the facts

43
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,959
and not only who says it so in this what

44
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,680
we're going to do today

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,120
we're talking about five pieces why we

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,920
are currently using side components and

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,950
if they are right if they are wrong and

48
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,150
I also want to give you a little

49
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,519
disclaimer so today I'm talking mostly

50
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,049
about site components there are other

51
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:30,400
approaches of CSS and J's but I have the

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,700
most experience with that one and also I

53
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,680
think that's the most popular package

54
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,890
right now for at least the react world

55
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,319
also I believe that people that write

56
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,019
these packages are awesome so I don't

57
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:46,030
have anything against them this is

58
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,340
really just mostly like what I

59
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,379
experienced by working with this in real

60
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,650
life and trying not to compare with

61
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,379
other solutions that are not CSS and J's

62
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,750
in the classic approach so I think the

63
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,540
biggest reason why we are starting to

64
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,349
put our CSS in our Jas is because sadly

65
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:11,530
CSS is render blocking that also means

66
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,189
that we need to bring it to our clients

67
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,959
as soon and as fast and as quick as

68
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,599
possible and how are we doing this so if

69
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,069
he like look at the classic approach to

70
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:26,859
include a style it's by using a link tag

71
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:32,270
and it's just linking to a CSS file and

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,720
what then happens in the browser is the

73
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,389
browser starts downloading the stuff so

74
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,639
first browser needs to know like what is

75
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,409
all there with the contents of it so

76
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:44,500
there's the HTML and then it starts

77
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,449
render downloading all the other stuff

78
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:49,810
which also contains our CSS because it

79
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,459
doesn't make sense for the browser to

80
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,769
start rendering or painting before it

81
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,569
doesn't know how the stuff should look

82
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,940
like otherwise you would always see for

83
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,169
a second a very ugly unstyled page and

84
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:03,099
that's also not so nice

85
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:04,780
so the browser decides instead to show

86
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,879
you a blank page until it all has

87
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,159
downloaded all the files and then it

88
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,859
starts painting so the easiest and

89
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:17,849
fastest way to not have render blocking

90
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:21,820
your Styles is to have them included in

91
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,670
your HTML they just having style

92
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,300
haxe and then put the sails all there

93
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,690
that was done even way before there was

94
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,110
something like react or you were angular

95
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,990
and people hated it because of different

96
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,410
reasons but we're back at that today and

97
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,060
makes sense because when we will now go

98
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,700
for example for style components this is

99
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,060
like the biggest feature of it you don't

100
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,040
even have to write a CSS file anymore

101
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,650
because you just write all your styles

102
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,530
in your javascript file next to the

103
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,920
stuff where you have to you render and

104
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,250
return of your component which is really

105
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,840
awesome really nice because it renders

106
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,930
like this so it generates you this

107
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,050
button component and it even generates

108
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,740
you automatically some class names and

109
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,480
then it pastes inline the CSS in the

110
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,690
bottom of the HTML so we have achieved

111
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,450
what we wanted we have our HTML combined

112
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,500
with our CSS and so the browser can

113
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,550
render faster than before because also

114
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,410
we only show the stuff that we show that

115
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,960
we need in the first page because in our

116
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,610
first page there is only the components

117
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,230
we show there and so there's only the

118
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,300
CSS of these components and nothing else

119
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,440
so we also show only the necessaries so

120
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,410
the critical CSS part okay but this is a

121
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,830
problem we have since longer time and

122
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,180
other people already had this idea and

123
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,490
develop a thing called backpack backpack

124
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,990
is a module bundler and just some magic

125
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,520
so it goes through all your files and

126
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,780
looks how they are tangled together

127
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,990
which imports which and then it pipes it

128
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,370
through and gives you out a very nice

129
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:36,910
bundle of all of these things so when

130
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,140
you have your project

131
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,790
and your web pack is there and then you

132
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,160
configure it like this that you add a

133
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,710
CSS load or style order to it and then

134
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,810
you can even say something like source

135
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,460
maps is there because that's one of the

136
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,350
not so nice things when everything is

137
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,010
crunched together

138
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,020
you don't know anymore where your pieces

139
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,700
are coming from and by source Maps

140
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,220
enabled you still know where the stuff

141
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,980
was once located so what you then do is

142
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,750
in your JavaScript file with backpack

143
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,650
configured you import your CSS file not

144
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,110
with a link like before but with a just

145
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,990
JavaScript import pointing to the file

146
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,500
and then where pack does the rest of the

147
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,280
magic for you

148
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,440
so it renders your vanilla button and

149
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,410
then it puts in the bottom after HTML

150
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,530
also your style and what's a little nice

151
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,010
comment to you where that original code

152
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,120
was from also very nice so kind of the

153
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,760
same thing solved but so we have done

154
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,920
all of this work like configuring web

155
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,850
pack or sai components to be faster so

156
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,420
let's compare them I did a little

157
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,170
experiment I know it's all blurry

158
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,620
so I created four buttons so one is a

159
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,450
like vanilla version that's the normal

160
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,520
version the other one is my primary

161
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,320
button the second one is mystic in the

162
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,090
red button and then there is a

163
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,330
combination of primary and inactive

164
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,080
state so just what we do normally in our

165
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,980
web applications we combine stuff and I

166
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,260
approach this like three different

167
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,760
things first I tried CSS vanilla CSS

168
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,830
with map pack then I tried sty

169
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,229
components by using props and I also

170
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,070
tried side components by using the

171
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,800
extent so there is no extent but you can

172
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,130
take your primary button and then add

173
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,120
another thing to it and extend it and

174
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,600
is your primary inactive I don't know if

175
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,500
you can see this so I let it all render

176
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,279
in the browser and they're not that far

177
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,270
apart

178
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,860
so the normal CSS takes about 3.4

179
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,920
seconds until the first meaningful paint

180
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,720
the site components with the props takes

181
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,990
around 3.5 seconds unto the first

182
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,170
meaningful paint and the extent one

183
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,500
takes 3.6 seconds that's all time very

184
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,600
close to each other but when you look at

185
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,020
the other the cake graph the donut um

186
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,390
you see that the scripting time is way

187
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,110
bigger for the Sai components approached

188
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,580
as for the CSS approach which also means

189
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,550
they are growing faster like this time

190
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,640
of script rendering scripting time grows

191
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,320
faster with the complexity of your

192
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,140
component system so the more props you

193
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,209
use the more extensive the more

194
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:59,400
variations you have the longer it will

195
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,510
take to script so it's very Wake thing

196
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,209
I'm saying now but it's most likely that

197
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,730
in the long run the site component

198
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,339
approach will load not as fast as when

199
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,110
you just have vanilla CSS ok so next

200
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,370
thing next very nice thesis and there is

201
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,540
collocation scheme so CSS has some

202
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,110
issues by design and it's not a mean

203
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,970
thing to say it's just fact

204
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,480
so in CSS everything is global in CSS

205
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,000
you have selectors which have very

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,810
specific rules how to like apply a style

207
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,640
and based on like how intense and how

208
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,440
strong your selector is your style is

209
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:58,070
stronger than the other one and so now I

210
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,080
and slight components is going for

211
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,330
colocation which means that you put your

212
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,340
style in the same thing as you put your

213
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,950
render component which means that it's

214
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,990
always in the same file it's always in

215
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,640
the same location and it helps you with

216
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,970
just issues of the global stuff the

217
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,640
inheritance and everything which is

218
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,270
really nice so awesome so but imagine so

219
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,280
this is something I copied from a

220
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,260
project I'm currently working on this is

221
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,500
just AI components in one of our a

222
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,930
little bit more complex components and

223
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,460
I'm seeing a little bit more it's

224
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,590
cheeser that have a button and a text on

225
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,320
it okay and there are a hundred lines of

226
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,640
code that are only dedicated to styles

227
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,530
so if you want to see what's actually

228
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,870
going on in that component you need to

229
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,470
scroll a hundred lines which is annoying

230
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,570
especially when you work on that thing

231
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,190
more often um also just imagine you have

232
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,260
a more like generic component like a

233
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,690
wrapper and you're doing your

234
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,940
collocation and somehow it's everywhere

235
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,220
because you start copying everything

236
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,470
because it's a generic component and

237
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,540
probably the difference is not very big

238
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,900
so you have copies over and over by cow

239
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,230
locating your component in your render

240
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,210
thingy and then you maybe decide okay

241
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,950
you know what I give up and echo

242
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,990
location for some like more generic

243
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,380
components I create our like space where

244
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,470
it put them like a component folder and

245
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,570
then because I also need to have

246
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,940
variations on this very basic component

247
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,150
I start to import them and add more

248
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,880
cells to them like I have a normal

249
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,110
wrapper and then I create a gallery

250
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,260
wrapper on it which is nice and works so

251
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,430
far really cool but so it gets rendered

252
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,690
to this so we have very nice not

253
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,300
readable classes and just one style and

254
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,050
we don't know anymore

255
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,870
like where which style is coming from

256
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,180
because sigh components doesn't support

257
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:22,300
source maps yet and if you don't know

258
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,580
exactly where all your rappers are you

259
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,220
probably will never find that again and

260
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,920
it's a little more helpful when we look

261
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,339
at the reactive bugger because there we

262
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:40,850
can at least see ok that style somewhere

263
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,760
used in a component named cat galleries

264
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,829
so part of my style will be there but I

265
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,620
had very often times where I wasn't able

266
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,110
to find the style that is bugging me

267
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,589
like literally without a project full

268
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:00,470
stay a text search so that is how I'm

269
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,079
finding my stuff now ok but but bobble

270
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,920
for the rescue

271
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,620
do you know bobble that's super cool

272
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,990
translator thing people have written

273
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,060
plug-ins for that because they have been

274
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,800
bucked by the same issue as I so and

275
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,200
when you have configured a bobble

276
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,839
plug-in for Sai components it finally

277
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,029
adds something meaningful to his class

278
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:29,089
names and it adds the react component

279
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,820
itself and his tie component to your

280
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,490
class name as prefix so you have a

281
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,670
better hint now where it is more or less

282
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,690
depending on how good you are in your

283
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,950
location style stuff but also there's

284
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:52,310
like a nun plugin required solution to

285
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,770
this issue and it is called parents and

286
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,620
there is one very nice pattern I tried

287
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,370
it in syrup like project so far and that

288
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,500
is called atomic design where you start

289
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,769
by like splitting your components in

290
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:12,440
their parts so you start by having the

291
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,329
slightest thing the smallest thing like

292
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:17,390
a button and then you start combining it

293
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,630
up to like molecules and organisms and

294
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,270
templates and pages and so by this way

295
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,460
you at least make sure that somehow

296
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,960
kind of no okay which parts of my

297
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,450
components are like the basic ones that

298
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,020
I have to reuse more often so I locate

299
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,850
them in one place and then the other

300
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,830
stuff I'm locating in like the bigger

301
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,110
component and so you kind of have a

302
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,209
better guess on where to locate the

303
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,390
stuff that also helps you when you use

304
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,970
style components so that's this is no

305
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,370
exclusive or something you can combine

306
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,589
them it's really cool so then as I

307
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,899
already have mentioned the other thing

308
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,370
that seems kind of bad about is scoping

309
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,910
what do I mean with scoping and maybe

310
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,190
one of you has done something like that

311
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,330
before

312
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,149
just having like a very long selector

313
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:16,430
and then still have to run an important

314
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,850
statement on it because you have a very

315
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,279
tangled Caeser space and you don't know

316
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,620
anymore where this comes from or you

317
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,450
have a third-party application that has

318
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,730
like some very strong selectors and

319
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,589
there is no other way to come around it

320
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,270
so yes that components means you put

321
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,100
everything next to each other which

322
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,200
means you don't have classes anymore

323
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,779
which means you cannot have two strong

324
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:42,770
selectors anymore

325
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:47,650
yay problem solved maybe you still have

326
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,430
some legacy CSS laying around or some

327
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,110
CSS from a third-party plugin maybe and

328
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,970
they have a very strong selector so and

329
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,040
still no matter what you do because in

330
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,959
your site component you cannot access

331
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,750
the class name anymore you cannot like

332
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,510
make your selector more specific so as

333
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,819
the selector is very specific your

334
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,350
button will still be pink like forever

335
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,470
what that is what rescue yeah there's a

336
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,990
second buffer plug-in that allows you to

337
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,730
generate something more specific and

338
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,390
it's doing it by how awesome oh yeah the

339
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,400
bible plugin is named ababa plugging

340
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,530
site component CSS namespace

341
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,300
very nice word and you can configure it

342
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,030
and then what it does it duplicates your

343
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,880
class name in your style definition to

344
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,650
make it more specific than any other

345
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,630
style okay cool

346
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,220
another nun plugin approach would be to

347
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,040
generally use some naming convention for

348
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,140
example BAM which is working like the

349
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:12,110
blog element modifier so that kind of

350
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,630
cute save you from two specific

351
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,720
selectors I mean it still doesn't

352
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,230
prevent you from bad sore party CSS but

353
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,580
at least your own CSS looks nicer than

354
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,750
okay so then the probably hardest thing

355
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,250
in software development next to

356
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,050
centering stuff and yeah okay naming

357
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,530
naming is really hard what do I mean

358
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,920
with that so maybe one of you also have

359
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,340
had that you have a button that has like

360
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,190
a bazillion class names on it you maybe

361
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,130
start like very nice with yourself which

362
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,920
was one class maybe a second class you

363
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,320
modifier maybe you even you spam but

364
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,750
somehow the next morning your designer

365
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,300
comes in and gives you like this unicorn

366
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,300
and then you're like okay now I add the

367
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,640
class unicorn to my button okay good

368
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:15,650
good so like components as I said they

369
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,870
generate the class names for you so you

370
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,490
don't have to care about this anymore

371
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,330
which is really really awesome but I

372
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,180
have a unpopular opinion now for you if

373
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,880
you can't name a thing you probably

374
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,640
don't need it so when I come into the

375
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,530
situation that a designer comes up to me

376
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,410
and gives me something and even with all

377
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,200
my atomic design approach on my BEM

378
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,170
classes I still would add a class like

379
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,380
fancy I'm going to my designer and start

380
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,380
asking them questions so the first

381
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,260
question I usually ask is

382
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,110
what problem of two user should this

383
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,409
thing solve that that is a very good

384
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,780
question always to your designer so what

385
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,090
should it do how should it help the user

386
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,370
to solve a problem or to reach a goal

387
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,169
[Music]

388
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,480
then it's just a variation of something

389
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,909
that is already existing and maybe why

390
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:18,770
is this variation better so maybe

391
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,690
there's a drop shadow now and your

392
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,549
button and the drop shadow is there

393
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:25,940
because there's now a button on a darker

394
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,039
background than before so then you

395
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,780
should think about okay do we need to

396
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,030
change all our backgrounds or not or

397
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,480
whatever so and also another question

398
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,909
would be is this a combination of

399
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,370
something that you already have just

400
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,549
newly arranged and does it matter to

401
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:46,730
like be like this or would it be

402
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,530
beneficial for us to maybe make an a/b

403
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,510
test and see which of them is working

404
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,370
better and then we decide for just one

405
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:58,490
of the variations and also that also

406
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,500
very nice question what is the semantic

407
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,960
meaning of the thing like is it the

408
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,539
primary action is it like the call to

409
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:08,539
action is it a warning and information

410
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:11,630
and error and all these helps you to

411
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,559
define the name of a thing and if you

412
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,120
still can't find the name of the thing

413
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,850
and your designer starts to questioning

414
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,390
himself or herself maybe you have like

415
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,789
saved all on every one of you from a

416
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:31,460
fancy button class okay so so far we

417
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,530
have talked about many of the issues of

418
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,760
CSS and also there's one really cool

419
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,890
thing on site components which you

420
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,780
couldn't do before and that's throwing

421
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:47,780
props at everything okay so now it's I

422
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,179
components you can add this kind of

423
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:52,940
props to your button and then use them

424
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,820
for styling which is really exciting

425
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,590
unfortunately just looks like this so

426
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,570
now you have your props but somehow you

427
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,070
have to apply them and

428
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,019
to apply them you have to use smart

429
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,330
JavaScript which means in this case

430
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,019
error functions and I have also seen

431
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,749
something like that but not error

432
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:18,109
functions but a lot of offenses and I

433
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:20,450
don't know about you but if you ask me I

434
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:25,009
don't want to maintain this because like

435
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,379
adding a new variation there would mean

436
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,169
like adding and you if or maybe breaking

437
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:33,950
all the other ifs or I don't know how

438
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,349
would you remove like a variation of

439
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:36,950
that

440
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,099
how can you easily tell what style is

441
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:46,700
applied in which case so awesome

442
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,919
how does it look like when we render it

443
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:50,720
and reactive over it looks like this

444
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,330
that you can at least see what kind of

445
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,970
props you are applying to it and what

446
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,239
values they have but in the end it just

447
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:02,090
is combined into again one style class

448
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,729
so you don't know which prop is causing

449
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:07,999
which line of style you can't tell from

450
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:13,599
looking at the debugger in chrome also

451
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,269
when we now take the other approach with

452
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,830
the bobble plug-in that gives us better

453
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,700
class names we still don't see what prop

454
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,460
is calling causing which style there is

455
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,109
no mention of primary there okay so

456
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,700
let's try a different approach

457
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,539
don't use props try the extents but

458
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:39,169
suddenly I have by like having just

459
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,619
primary secondary normal active and

460
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:46,249
inactive I have now six button

461
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:53,389
components okay yes and again this is

462
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:55,220
how they look in the browser and somehow

463
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,099
the primary inactive has six classes six

464
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:04,789
classes okay and somehow from these six

465
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:10,560
classes only three provides style

466
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,590
what why so at first I thought I have

467
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,820
done something wrong maybe I have

468
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,150
misconfigured soy components but then I

469
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,610
found that on github and one of the

470
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,680
contributor says how we did to some

471
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,550
purpose that we add always another class

472
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,820
to it that is therefore identifying your

473
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,090
component because when you have a closer

474
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,110
look on all these classes they change

475
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,060
their name every time you add a new

476
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,350
style or remove a style so there is no

477
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,510
way how you can like predict what is

478
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,000
happening based on your site class but

479
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,310
the other the second class which hasn't

480
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,210
any style rules is the identifier which

481
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,030
is also just gibberish so maybe someone

482
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,940
can tell me why they didn't prefix them

483
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,210
on default I don't know but they decided

484
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,050
against it

485
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,400
okay let's look at some more classic

486
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,460
stuff let's look at normal CSS or sass

487
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,300
in this okay in this case where I have

488
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,370
created a button and added just the

489
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,680
classes like I would usually do with

490
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:26,950
primary and overwriting by inactive and

491
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,520
this is what it comprises what everybody

492
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,560
has seen this already so I can clearly

493
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,500
tell like which class is causing which

494
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,770
style which is nice for debugging I

495
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,320
would say and also maybe for identifying

496
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,230
where I should probably optimize my

497
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:48,420
style okay but probs I want to have

498
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,840
props please give me my props back ok

499
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,740
maybe I have something how about best of

500
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,650
both worlds so maybe some of you have

501
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,810
already stats I component tries to

502
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,000
create a higher-order component which is

503
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,760
 and react higher-order components

504
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,760
and react higher-order components
so let's do some higher-order component

505
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,400
so let's create a higher-order component

506
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,940
for a button and give it some props for

507
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,700
example a type for example the inactive

508
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,820
and then take these props and

509
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,150
make them into bemmon classes so we now

510
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,360
have like the button st lock and the

511
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,800
primary ended active has modifiers and

512
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,710
then we just like give it to the

513
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:44,330
component and we turn a button and also

514
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,910
something that we can do now which side

515
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,370
component doesn't with the process we

516
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,230
can define prop types and default props

517
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,450
so everybody that wants to reuse a

518
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,760
component we have done for example

519
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,640
button knows exactly what they can give

520
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,570
as prop and we'll get like meaningful

521
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,220
warning and error messages in the

522
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,020
debugger when they saw something wrong

523
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,120
with it just really nice I believe okay

524
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,350
so let's summarize that was a lot of

525
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:26,120
talking about CSS okay the render

526
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,860
blocking part we talked about it in the

527
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,020
beginning we can solve it with side

528
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,400
components you can solve it with

529
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,480
backpack so and then you would probably

530
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,060
need to look at what is going to be more

531
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,430
performant for you in the long run then

532
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,730
the conventions like using a design

533
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,800
pattern like atomic design and naming

534
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,650
conventions like them help you even if

535
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,630
you are using side components but also

536
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,280
you can use them with other components

537
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,140
and get rid of a couple of node modules

538
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:07,850
maybe then we had thought that

539
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,980
communication can solve some problems

540
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,310
like naming like having too many

541
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,050
variations on your website so

542
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,350
communication is always king and will

543
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,140
definitely help you on getting rid of a

544
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:26,840
lot of your problems and then the last

545
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,670
thing is props are really really fancy

546
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,920
but they're dangerous and may be hard to

547
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,070
debug and maintain

548
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,429
okay so but when is Sai components

549
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,230
really beneficial for you because I mean

550
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,840
a lot of users people are using it

551
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,500
already and like it and love it and so I

552
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,529
would say if you want to bootstrap

553
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:55,179
something very quick because you don't

554
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:57,460
have to think too much about CSS

555
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,350
architecture and everything just put it

556
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,380
next to your render stuff and you're

557
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,299
good to go it's really cool then yeah

558
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:09,340
when you don't have a designer or you're

559
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,279
not easily able to talk to them I'm not

560
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,139
saying that you don't want to talk to

561
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:16,659
them but maybe in some companies

562
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:18,760
designers are not in house there's

563
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,860
somewhere else and so you cannot let go

564
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,860
and poke them every day so maybe you

565
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,260
just want to like soft things quickly

566
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:31,179
and then I would sigh component yeah

567
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:32,740
that's one thing I haven't talked about

568
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,880
yet but the most awesome thing about the

569
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,519
site component approach is that you can

570
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,740
share them with your react native

571
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,110
application because react native

572
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,450
applications is not so well with vanilla

573
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,289
CSS so when you put your CSS in your

574
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:54,250
JavaScript and then give it to the react

575
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,200
native they can just use the same

576
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,480
components as you do in your normal

577
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,460
reactor plication so and there's just

578
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,659
one more thing I want to like say and

579
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:09,190
that is the worldís bigger than you

580
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,840
react so I had a very nice privilege to

581
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,409
listen once to a talk of how can leave

582
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:21,970
who is one of the yeah who is like the

583
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,399
father of CSS

584
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,630
he brought CSS to life back in the day

585
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,539
when they were working on CERN together

586
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,830
with Tim berners-lee

587
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,590
and he had a vision to make to pop a

588
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,399
nicer prettier place as freely as they

589
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:42,820
had in their environment and so when you

590
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,090
think back from the beginning of CSS 2

591
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,910
where was there and where it is today

592
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,730
we also have the abilities of pure CSS

593
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,100
variables now where we have now finally

594
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,740
rounded corners and are now able to

595
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,070
Center things gradually so there has

596
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,580
been a lot so maybe we should also trust

597
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,040
in the development of CSS that it can

598
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,520
overcome its issues and not just

599
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,280
throwing the JavaScript hammer on it so

600
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,560
[Applause]
