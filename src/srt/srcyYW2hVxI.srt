00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:12,620

usually when you're programming Arduino

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,830
you use things like C and C++ which is

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,570
what I use all the time now but as an

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,759
introductory thing when you're used to

5
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:21,740
using javascript going over to see is

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,449
kind of annoying they also have

7
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:25,820
libraries for Ruby and Python or if

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,050
those are languages that you're more

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,320
comfortable in as well the first thing I

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,019
did was make something light up which is

11
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:35,059
the hello world of hardware you make

12
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:39,230
something light up so I over a weekend

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,960
hack pack weekend I made some lights

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,629
happen with JavaScript and it felt super

15
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,850
powerful I was like this is so neat I

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,119
have made this happen and then the

17
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,769
second thing that we did is make this

18
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:54,350
sweet Christmas sweater do you guys have

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,159
the node knockout so every year does

20
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,659
anyone participated in the node knockout

21
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:04,430
I see a hand to applicants ok so the no

22
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,380
doc out is a worldwide competition that

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,750
happens once a year the year that we did

24
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,140
it was had 700 teams around the world

25
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,760
you get a team of four people and you

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,620
build a product together in a weekend

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,290
and at the end of the weekend you submit

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,420
your project and it gets judged by a

29
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,210
panel of judges so we built this

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,159
Christmas sweater where you go online

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,530
and you type in something and it shows

32
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,720
up on the sweater the most useless thing

33
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,080
ever but we won the Innovation Award

34
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,280
which is really awesome we have these

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,159
great boxing shorts that they sent us so

36
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,900
that was super fun and it was it was a

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,409
great weekend and I learned all types of

38
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,830
things like so those that thing is

39
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,500
called an LOL shield which stands for

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,380
lots of leds and in order for have words

41
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,390
go across it you have to control each

42
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,850
individual LED and pass on a library

43
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,549
that has fonts so that you can spell

44
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,830
words I just always assume that ok you

45
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,090
just type the words and then they show

46
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,130
up but it was interesting and need to

47
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,530
control each LED and figure out this is

48
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,610
how we're going to make the word go

49
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,299
across the screen so there's a lot of

50
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:16,580
stuff in the node wats community which

51
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,620
is really neat there is no bots day this

52
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,950
is some this is these are

53
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,069
begins that happen usually in July where

54
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,290
people from around the world just make

55
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,390
really new cool stuff with node BOTS and

56
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,860
share it's not a competition or a

57
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,540
hackathon people just make cool stuff

58
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,220
I've seen one really neat thing about

59
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,440
node wats day is that people of all ages

60
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,890
participate I see families I see like

61
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,260
dads and moms go with their kids and

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,420
build neat robots over a weekend and

63
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,980
demo it it's a really neat experience

64
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,840
for everyone I had great experience at

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,319
jas calm and robots calm the

66
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,450
original-jay has comp in Florida that

67
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,940
inspired all these amazing j/s comps

68
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,640
around the world and robots calm which

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,140
is a relatively new conference which

70
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,590
just focuses on node baths and chris

71
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,470
williams who runs Jay esscom built node

72
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,049
serial port which is the way that our do

73
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,140
we know talks to your laptop and so he's

74
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,989
really passionate about node bots so he

75
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,900
put together these sweet activities at

76
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,980
JS com node copter which I think you're

77
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,970
seeing a demo of later is a way to

78
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,150
control the AR drones from JavaScript

79
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,200
the AR drones work like a web server

80
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,870
where you can just send it commands from

81
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,750
your laptop the coolest thing I've seen

82
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,290
so far is there's a video online I'm

83
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,370
going to reference a couple things

84
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,709
there's videos on my blog I'll share a

85
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,010
link later but the coolest thing I've

86
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,829
seen is a gentleman you know Dance Dance

87
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,079
Revolution ddr the game where you dance

88
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,549
so you hooked a bit ddr pad to an AR

89
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,819
drone and did Gangnam style as part of a

90
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,190
hackathon competition which was really

91
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,019
neat so there's lots of cool stuff you

92
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,299
can do node rockets is also really

93
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,700
interesting they are rockets controlled

94
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,650
by javascript which is it seems like a

95
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,300
terrible idea but no one has been her

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,460
yet I don't think and node boats are

97
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,409
literally boats that race in a swimming

98
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:34,950
pool that you build over a weekend so

99
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,800
like

100
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,720
said you get the parody ar.drone I

101
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,340
haven't seen a work with other drones on

102
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,590
their open source and they're really

103
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,900
awesome you can also make your own

104
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,389
though I've seen some people make their

105
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,370
own drones that you're neat the parrot

106
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,440
AR drones aren't cheap so usually I ask

107
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,879
someone that works at a company that

108
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,610
owns them if we can borrow them you can

109
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,949
treat your laptop as a server and make

110
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:04,000
them fly the node boats on these are

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,169
made out of soda bottles and you can get

112
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:11,680
a servo and an Arduino make sure to keep

113
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,360
everything dry inside on and you can do

114
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,550
really neat races around the pool you

115
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,379
can find all this stuff online there's

116
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:24,280
videos on node wats calm the node

117
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,830
rockets is what's really interesting

118
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:31,539
they use PVC piping as a base and a hose

119
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,719
and soda bottles and they got some

120
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,740
serious height I saw them going at least

121
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,819
four stories high it was pretty cool and

122
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:44,289
so there's a whole world that I've

123
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,020
discovered is part of jas coffin robots

124
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,270
conf is also introduced they gave away

125
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,289
spark spark cores which are tiny Arduino

126
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:56,380
'he's that have Wi-Fi enabled so as you

127
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,090
can see compared to the hand it's really

128
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,389
small and you can use it to talk to all

129
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:03,669
kinds of things they're designing it to

130
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,199
use at home they just released one

131
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,729
that's actually nineteen dollars which

132
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:10,449
is awesome and you can use it to talk

133
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,310
two things around your home especially

134
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,219
things that have existing Wi-Fi their

135
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:19,090
concept is to make the smart home and if

136
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,580
you look at their repository for the

137
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,770
spark or it's really neat because it's

138
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,930
completely open source hardware it's

139
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,279
actually the best open source hardware

140
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,529
repository I've ever seen because you

141
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,000
can get everything from the Eagle files

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,860
to make your own spark or if you have

143
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,930
the means to produce one of your own

144
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,969
they're like just make one of your own

145
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,590
you know you don't have to buy it from

146
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,229
us so the schematics everything is

147
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:43,270
included in their repository which is

148
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,969
pretty awesome so these are some

149
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:48,039
projects that people have made this is a

150
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,120
doorbell

151
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,139
um that works outside and it sent you an

152
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,580
email when someone's out your door which

153
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,590
is pretty cool this is a word clock

154
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,790
which is a really cool looking clock

155
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,350
another thing that I discovered a jay is

156
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,710
comp is super awesome Sylvia she is

157
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,510
great if you have not looked her up

158
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,550
please do if you've not seen any of our

159
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,710
video she was the keynote last year at

160
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,800
robots comp her and her dad built some

161
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,030
really neat things and one thing that

162
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:24,490
she built is a watercolor so it's a

163
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,590
watercolor machine where you upload an

164
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,650
SVG to the machine and it paints it just

165
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,780
in watercolor so you can just put an

166
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,580
image and it'll watercolor it matches

167
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,580
the tone of the image exactly as well

168
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,699
it's really neat so she was she's super

169
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,770
and smiling because also she's 13 and

170
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,080
she's done all the stuff online so I got

171
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,370
to meet her find out what she was

172
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,600
interested in and that was a really cool

173
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,889
experience so then after that there's

174
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:52,419
also this show have you seen the show

175
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,240
it's called control-alt-delete you

176
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,099
should look it up I don't know if you

177
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,020
guys can get it here but if you pirate

178
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,039
things it's a really cool show um not

179
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,590
that I endorse it so some things past

180
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,870
yes constable Z's are instructables and

181
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,090
as you can see these things are becoming

182
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,190
pretty mainstream they partnered with

183
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,130
home depot and radio shack and other

184
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,639
really big online institutions to do

185
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,770
do-it-yourself stuff at home which is

186
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,810
pretty neat I think it's especially neat

187
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,699
because it shows how much mainstream

188
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,979
this stuff is becoming and how

189
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:28,900
accessible they're trying to make it for

190
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,539
everyone you can go on instructables and

191
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,880
find how to make food or how to make

192
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,430
some really neat stuff and this these

193
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,020
are all light up clothes and different

194
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,980
things like that the suit in the middle

195
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,950
is a Tron suit that I tried to make it

196
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,050
did not work out that great but it looks

197
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,620
awesome in the picture but but yeah

198
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,420
instructables has all kinds of things

199
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,089
and there everything is step-by-step so

200
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,260
if you want to build something in

201
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,120
hardware it's really detailed there's a

202
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
support forum if you

203
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,810
have trouble and hopefully we won't end

204
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,070
up like me and you can make something a

205
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,890
little bit better than that I also

206
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,350
discovered as part of that research

207
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,640
Becky stern she works for Adafruit and

208
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,490
Adafruit is a company that does open

209
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,080
source wearables and they also sell

210
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,070
parts like Arduino they do the there are

211
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,080
doing is that you can sew into clothes I

212
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,150
think it's the Adafruit flora they do

213
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,640
now you can also do a conduct conductive

214
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,270
thread so you can take an Arduino so it

215
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,040
into your clothes take conductive thread

216
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,020
and sew in LEDs and different things

217
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,970
like that it's really neat and they have

218
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,430
instructions all over online I worked

219
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,140
with a 13 year old girl who made a

220
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,600
sweatshirt that has directionals on her

221
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,520
back so that when she rides her bike she

222
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,020
can just hit a button in her sleeve and

223
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,790
she has an arrow on the back of her

224
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,550
sweatshirt which is pretty cool and they

225
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,870
have all the instructions for things

226
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,160
like that on Adafruit they make this

227
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,860
really neat stuff that on the top left

228
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,830
is makeup that's conductive makeup so

229
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,490
these girls put on conductive material

230
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,500
into makeup put these LEDs on their

231
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,810
foreheads and it looks awesome I mean if

232
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,010
you were walking down the street it

233
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,470
would be really startling but it looks

234
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,770
really neat i think that tie changes

235
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,500
color with music a lot of this stuff you

236
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,580
maybe couldn't wear to work every day

237
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,220
but it's really neat those videos online

238
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,900
and like I said they're on my blog as

239
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,750
well this is a microphone holder that

240
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,030
changes color and that's a sweet bike

241
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,740
helmet and no one can miss you if you're

242
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,080
wearing that bike helmet so these are

243
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,910
all the things that I've been learning

244
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,130
about in the past couple years the world

245
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,850
is the world of open source wearables

246
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,050
and open source things have been really

247
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,270
accessible people are also super nice

248
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,000
the first couple hackathons I went to I

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,020
was just like I don't know what I'm

250
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,180
doing someone next to me was super

251
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,920
helpful and now when I'm in a hackathon

252
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,150
someone's like I don't know what I'm

253
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,280
doing I'm like oh let me show you it's

254
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,690
pretty it's an awesome world I'm sure

255
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,220
you've had the same experience though I

256
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,540
had the same experience in the

257
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,220
JavaScript world it translates really

258
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,329
well to node by

259
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,759
it's the same attitude of let's all

260
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,089
learn together so this is the first

261
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:23,589
thing I mean it's really ugly it's a

262
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,309
Christmas ornament with a light in it I

263
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,720
even tried to like put other stuff with

264
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,689
it to make it look a little bit better

265
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,989
but I just figured hey I want to make

266
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:37,569
something that looks nice and is a

267
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:39,790
wearable and I want to make it of my own

268
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,019
so I did that and that's going to be a

269
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,259
while actually took me a while and this

270
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:47,619
changed color based on your twitter

271
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:50,559
status so if your twitter status and

272
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,850
that's on my github if your twitter

273
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,269
status is sad it changes to blue and

274
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:58,089
things like that and so this is the

275
00:11:58,089 --> 00:11:59,980
first design of it and this is the

276
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,199
second design of it now it looks little

277
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:04,989
better and these cat these cad files are

278
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,519
online as well if you want a laser cut

279
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,019
flower or on or the I guess the body and

280
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:13,540
the necklace you can do that but it

281
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,069
changes color based on your Twitter feed

282
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,829
so in order to go from really ugly

283
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:21,459
jewelry to this I found some people on

284
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:23,049
etsy and I was like I need to design

285
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,970
something can you help me they're like

286
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,480
okay and I got designs from them and I

287
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,179
worked with them to collaborate on

288
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:33,850
something like this and now we're here

289
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,869
and this inside a Julie bot lives a web

290
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:39,759
server that is four millimeters by four

291
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,059
millimeters which is crazy so small um

292
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:47,019
and all the things that I learned from

293
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:49,600
nodebots translates here all the

294
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,730
bluetooth module zywert in a node bas

295
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,100
translates to this tiny bluetooth module

296
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,350
that we're working with now and some of

297
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,759
them some of the components i'm using

298
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,589
are the same like the same motor that

299
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,509
you use and you get from Adafruit is

300
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,489
what we're using and the same type of

301
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:05,799
lipo batteries is what we're using so

302
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,720
all of this stuff has translated really

303
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,790
well to doing this full time now and

304
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,790
we're part of a highway 1 accelerator in

305
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,819
San Francisco and they've been really

306
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,410
helpful but I wouldn't be able to do it

307
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,329
at all if it weren't for no advice in

308
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:22,540
general so if you want to get started

309
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,889
with this I want to say it's easy right

310
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,480
that sounds like it might not be easy

311
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,740
but it is

312
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,830
um feel free to reach out on my blog or

313
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,140
Twitter or anything this is what you

314
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,630
need you need an arduino uno and you

315
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,560
need an LED and if you go to the Johnny

316
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,620
Five repository and just look in the LED

317
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,200
library it's really you can just copy

318
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,580
and paste some code to get it working

319
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,710
for the first time and once you get that

320
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,180
working for the first time you have that

321
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,650
blinking light in front of you with such

322
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,600
an empowering experience you feel like a

323
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,170
god you're like I have made this happen

324
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,050
so I highly recommend and I hope that

325
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,550
some of the stuff you see today inspires

326
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,050
you to get started and feel free to
