[Music]

2
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,670
hi good morning everyone so I'm really

3
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,400
glad that I'm sharing a stage with two

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,070
unicorns today so just I always you say

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,289
that she's gonna speak with like half

6
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,330
British half Singaporean accent but I'm

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,649
gonna go out Singapore next so I am from

8
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,290
Singapore so if you are from out how

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,350
welcome to Singapore it's the way that

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,750
this really is a not bad it's actually a

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,469
lot hotter on other days yeah so many

12
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,710
people okay so my name is issue I'm a

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,230
software engineer at carousel

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,199
so what carousel is okay this is how our

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,930
website look like is actually a place

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,690
where user get to buy and sell directly

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,830
from each other so a little similar to

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,460
eBay I guess yeah so what people do on

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,750
carousels that they care to buy

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,810
limited-edition goods usually and then

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,509
sometimes they buy Avengers footage from

22
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,310
other people before so that they can

23
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,710
wash before their friends voice them so

24
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,780
I realized that that's only one bullet

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,729
point which is a period so I'm gonna put

26
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,909
a second one I got myself electrical

27
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,210
engineering degree before starting my

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,299
career as a software engineer so usually

29
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,150
when people ask me like can you tell me

30
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,409
something about electrical engineering

31
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,689
and I'll tell them do you know how your

32
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,049
keyboards they are not individual the I

33
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,960
individual buttons but then the the

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,610
wires crisscross yeah so I'm currently

35
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,990
working on the web platform at carousel

36
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,600
this is an article that come out about

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,940
half a year ago October more than that

38
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,540
okay so this is this is Stacy who is our

39
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,590
web team

40
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,330
he joined he wrote down like how this

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,640
project came about so this project is

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,739
like carousel like if you had seen like

43
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,959
Twitter like we have a carousel like

44
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,060
version and then we only serve it to our

45
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,200
mobile users and that's only one goal in

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,030
this like version which is to make it as

47
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,280
performant as possible okay so I didn't

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,910
plan for this

49
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:49,319
but then so two days ago Alex Lakatos

50
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,829
went to our office for a meet-up and

51
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:57,630
then booms he tried to like profile our

52
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:16,059
website and

53
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:21,049
oh thank goodness he said it was a good

54
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:35,450
performing website okay so from we had

55
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,489
and but on this project because our

56
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,200
previous code base was about five year

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,639
old it was showing a lot of signs of

58
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,810
aging and so then the decision was sent

59
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,359
to halt all new features and then to

60
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,909
concentrate so every single engineers

61
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:51,859
who was working a web platform stopped

62
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:55,489
our normal work to move on to work on

63
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:59,510
this migration and who engineers this is

64
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,359
this is just great news because we got

65
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:04,760
to work on completely a complete new

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,400
code base from scratch and then we make

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,400
to me we can make design decision we and

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,719
then because we were already working on

69
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,340
our code base we know other features

70
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,400
that we have so we solve have more like

71
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,060
a 20/20 hindsight to building this and

72
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,580
then we get to try new ap eyes yes so

73
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,020
but it's not without problems so today

74
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,190
I'm going to share about some of the

75
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,250
lessons that I've learned and

76
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,370
specifically pertaining to components so

77
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,380
Schroeder he's sure where we have always

78
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,409
been trying to break our code up into

79
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:47,050
pieces so this is a chart of the journey

80
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,690
there's a lot logo I guess yeah I gotta

81
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,370
understand mm-hmm

82
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,280
PHP server so we try to break things out

83
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,050
on the server we try to do it on

84
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,740
JavaScript with moo-stache

85
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,009
handover and then of course there was

86
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,949
backbone and then we move on to angular

87
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:09,770
react view today and also web components

88
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,110
so what's that small logo at the bottom

89
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,400
okay let me zoom it in components so

90
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,360
today everything is a component if you

91
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,340
like it it's great if you don't like it

92
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,930
everything is still a component so

93
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,770
component has become the de-facto

94
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,750
building

95
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,090
patterns of front-end framework today

96
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,450
and depending on like the framework that

97
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,580
you're using or you are not using

98
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,000
framework this the semantics it's a bit

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,990
different so my favorite description of

100
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,390
it of what the component is is that it

101
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,170
has data

102
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,070
yes structure and yes algorithm so not

103
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,340
not this one not this boat but

104
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,380
separately they attach structure and our

105
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,140
algorithm so data I think this is a bit

106
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,880
it's quite straightforward we know like

107
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,340
this is what the information this

108
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,440
component contains and you also have

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,930
structure so for web to us this is the

110
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,380
Dom and algorithm algorithm it's

111
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,090
sometimes it's called met that's

112
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,730
sometimes called functions these are

113
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,620
things that determine what this

114
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,130
component can do so a lot of the

115
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,660
discussion about components usually

116
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,150
bring up two concepts so first concept

117
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,000
is the single responsibility principle

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,740
which is that every single class or

119
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,900
every single module or in our case every

120
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,610
sink component in a program should have

121
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,140
responsibility for just a single piece

122
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,070
of the program's functionality and the

123
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,390
second concept you should talk about is

124
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,620
composable composable which is that the

125
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,169
components can be selected and assembled

126
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,020
in various combination to satisfy the

127
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,520
user requirement okay so for this talk I

128
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,300
will try to be as framework agnostic as

129
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,530
possible but then I like react a lot if

130
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,410
we can do everything we're I would have

131
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,240
done everything we react so today's

132
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,550
point of view it's gonna come from react

133
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,110
but then hopefully it can also apply to

134
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,800
different different other different

135
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,220
forum was also so for show hand over

136
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,229
here who uses react and like yeah oh my

137
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,570
goodness thank goodness I was I was so

138
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,669
afraid that everybody is gonna save you

139
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,960
view

140
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,950
okay okay so I'm sure everybody is

141
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,870
familiar with the concept of atomic

142
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,820
design so this is atomic design this is

143
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,790
not atomic CSS I think as an industry

144
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,460
it's time for us to ask one of them to

145
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,800
change the name because it's a bit too

146
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,610
confusing

147
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,210
so using in this conservative design we

148
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,460
we start the smallest element and they

149
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,320
are atoms and then we use them as

150
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,250
building blocks to build bigger larger

151
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,350
building blocks and then this larger

152
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,460
building blocks is then used to make

153
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,830
even larger building blocks and then in

154
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,280
our in web this is called a page usually

155
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,080
and this is a really good concept that

156
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,760
we can apply to start building a

157
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,630
component library so we start by sassing

158
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,070
out across the different pages and what

159
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,930
kind of components that we will reuse

160
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,030
them over and over again and I really

161
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,560
start by building them so if I worked on

162
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,690
a component library before usually we'll

163
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,700
start with button we will start with

164
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,270
select so this process is great because

165
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,310
it's gonna give you the look at a few of

166
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,310
a site very very quickly sometimes the

167
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,990
thing about like look at few I think I

168
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,700
mean this is how your cat look like or

169
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,210
this is how your animation look like but

170
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,710
a lot of times it's actually determined

171
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,020
by your phone sizes your phone family

172
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,120
what kind of type scale you are using

173
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,760
okay color palette you're using and this

174
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,820
is very it's it's gonna come off very

175
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,440
soon once you build your first pattern

176
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,140
and you build your first like select

177
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,940
component or your style your first

178
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,730
select component so it's gonna mentally

179
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,150
influence how you build your component

180
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,190
on the very lowest level and so these

181
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,440
are like the atoms the the the two the

182
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,590
one with they go block and then so once

183
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,690
your beaut finish or this your thing

184
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,400
okay what's the next step should be your

185
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,350
cut because you know every single

186
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,390
website has a cut

187
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,770
it's it's everywhere so once I be okay I

188
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,750
have my button I my select on my cut and

189
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,320
I realized oh am i stuck i what do I

190
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,150
mean UNIX you know

191
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,960
so I think okay Oh the very common

192
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,890
reusable components one is Napa so no

193
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,040
every page has a Napa but they always

194
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,260
look the same okay maybe not that usable

195
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,120
and then we have a footer okay yeah as

196
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,700
long as you don't have infinite

197
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,220
scrolling users I could not see a food

198
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,810
and okay so I got myself my batter I

199
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,970
might select my cut my nav bar my footer

200
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,360
and I look at the design and then I see

201
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,470
okay this this iPhone iPhone next iPhone

202
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,529
x7 plus pure looking thing so this is

203
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,870
this is our search result page and then

204
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,250
when you go into a search result page

205
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,170
most of time we will try to suggest you

206
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,360
other terms that we think you might be

207
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,740
like like do you mean you want to you

208
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,550
want to search for iPhone 6 instead so

209
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,920
to me this looks like a very reusable

210
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,910
component so I look deeper into our

211
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,040
Zeppelin and I realized that there are

212
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,320
actually variations to this component

213
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,570
there are different colors and then this

214
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:04,450
one that has a close button so the one

215
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,790
on top what's more like an anchor

216
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,310
because just now you see I'm on the

217
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,959
iPhone page and then when i click on it

218
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,850
i will go to iphone 6 page so it's like

219
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,180
a navigation but then the close one it's

220
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,850
not gonna navigate anywhere so don't

221
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,480
wise it's gonna be an anchor and then

222
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,580
the one below is probably gonna be like

223
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,380
a deep wrapping a pea tank and then have

224
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,980
a close button as a sibling like oh okay

225
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,660
this is actually a lot more complicated

226
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,700
than what I was thinking in the first

227
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,529
place and the suggestion here is those

228
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:44,890
soft imaginary problems because as

229
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,350
engineers we don't want our code to come

230
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,930
back and buy us so we try and design our

231
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,910
API is to keep it as flexible as

232
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,170
possible and and then we need to pre

233
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,360
Emma log and we might end up pre-empting

234
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,820
for a problem that we'll never

235
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,630
happen or we leave a room for an API

236
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:09,270
that will never gonna create later on so

237
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,240
it's in our code guideline which is also

238
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,130
known as I'm not going to approve you up

239
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,920
here that you shouldn't be solving for

240
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,710
imaginary problems and I'm gonna coin

241
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,880
the term here instead is to tackle your

242
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,530
components outside in in this approach

243
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,830
we instead of going from bottom upwards

244
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,990
like how atomic design is we're gonna do

245
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,000
it very similar to how we have always be

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,990
HTML which is from top to the bottom so

247
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,140
top level we will have the pitch you

248
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,820
start with a blank page you start

249
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,740
filling up the spaces you put in your

250
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,930
header you put in your left sidebar you

251
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,460
put in your right mean body and you

252
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,780
couldn't realize that this whole pitch

253
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,490
component this one single component it's

254
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,590
gonna be really really big don't worry

255
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,330
about it we'll get to that on how to

256
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,350
breaking them up so first step is while

257
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,080
you're building you will realize that

258
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,790
sometimes there are things that you go

259
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,150
that actually should have been a library

260
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,150
and this is gonna very commonly come out

261
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,030
as like pagination to keep error

262
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,780
messages or like a localized they labor

263
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,550
so this kind of thing when you are

264
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,690
building your page you'll be like

265
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,990
actually this one somebody should have

266
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:35,490
done it right so this and this is when

267
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,740
you realize that okay this is where I

268
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,100
need to break it up into a component we

269
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,770
have a text component in our in our code

270
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,270
base it's got it somewhere because

271
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,620
you'll be like isn't that just a P tag

272
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,210
one we have encapsulated in this

273
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,420
component functions and style

274
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,220
they will make our life easier so for

275
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,800
example what will happen if you overflow

276
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,750
sure you should you put like the

277
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,080
ellipses the three dot should use the

278
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,880
point multi-line she only support single

279
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,370
line this has things that will she built

280
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,530
it into our text component so that once

281
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,070
you use it you stop having to worry

282
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,330
about it so in fact we have built a lot

283
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,070
of components in our component like

284
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:19,970
media like this

285
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,120
they sound like HTML element button

286
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,560
input text and girl they all sound like

287
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,290
HTML element but what we did was to put

288
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,390
a lot of functionality into it that

289
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,820
makes your life easier every time you

290
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,530
think oh it should have been solved by

291
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,420
someone else it'd have been solved by

292
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,760
all these components and this is where I

293
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,830
recommend starting your component

294
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:48,860
library so on a sidenote iterate often

295
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,170
because of the outside in approach you

296
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,610
can realize that sometimes it gonna mean

297
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,130
something out so for example our error

298
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,410
message here we missed it out we built

299
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,780
it as part of our pitch the big pitch

300
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,640
component but actually they are very

301
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,830
they are happening quite often and they

302
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,030
should be components on their own so if

303
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,150
you so it's okay that you missed it out

304
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,980
the first time around because each time

305
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,350
rect read retro actively you try and

306
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,710
make them into components it's a very

307
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,150
comfortable detoxing process so this is

308
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,280
our pitch component it looks a bit short

309
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,140
because they have been broken up into

310
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,110
different render functions so now is

311
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,660
because now we have so what we have now

312
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,130
is actually our component I read a very

313
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,110
small components that we have this big

314
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,370
pitch component what is at our next

315
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,880
guideline to start breaking it up don't

316
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,730
make it okay I want to name this

317
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,060
technique don't make it awkward so this

318
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,140
is content it's a little bit awkward

319
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,600
over here we check that we should load

320
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,980
more and then previously we did a lot

321
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,190
more then now we should lot more and

322
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,520
then there's a query no query don't load

323
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,970
only then we asked for so this is

324
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,070
actually just now that puce these are

325
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,660
all that checking they returned so this

326
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,070
is an OCO that we have where we checked

327
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,400
before we were loaded up you after we've

328
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,440
read the refactoring we actually moved

329
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,660
up yourself into a component by itself

330
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,190
and we all

331
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,760
we call for the API on deep mouth so

332
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,200
this is been checked by over on the top

333
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,860
so the the parent component will choose

334
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,570
whether do - so it's like a this or now

335
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,910
so only when you have something loaded

336
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,560
and then inside the component you will

337
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,560
say okay I will ask for the data myself

338
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,100
so a bit it's a bit clearer so when you

339
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,610
want to sleep a component a good gauge

340
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,870
is fitted along your data lines because

341
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,300
the closer your data is to your

342
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,050
component the easier things will be

343
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,610
after a lot of our work is actually to

344
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,689
translate data into interface and a lot

345
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,959
of our apps today are very data-driven

346
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,240
and they and data itself is very guided

347
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,730
by information architecture although we

348
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,620
are all friend F and then we don't trust

349
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,040
that Y and F but I believe they do their

350
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,220
work also they they will split the data

351
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,710
properly just like how we will split our

352
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,670
data abruptly so use it as a hint each

353
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,100
time you realize that this is gonna be a

354
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,020
different model this is going to be a

355
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,110
different endpoint it's a good time

356
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,900
where you split things up so most of the

357
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,390
time your one pitch is not gonna be just

358
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,040
one single API call it's going to be

359
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,620
five use that as a chance to split it

360
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,320
into five separate components and then

361
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,290
if let's say one one API returns you an

362
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,890
array of listings use that chance to

363
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,490
realize that you can have you can split

364
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:13,750
them up into a small listing component

365
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,800
sometimes you will realize that your

366
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,620
data doesn't match how things look

367
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,600
because you know sometimes the designer

368
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,960
and the end F don't work too well so you

369
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,640
get stuck in the middle

370
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,150
use a data adapter so a data adapter can

371
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,390
happen it can be like a YouTube function

372
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,929
so you can do it after you fetch or they

373
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:38,370
all right at the point where you you

374
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,870
retrieve your data up from your store

375
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,570
this so they are actually functions

376
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,970
where you will transform how information

377
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,070
came in from back-end to how each look

378
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,500
on the front-end try not to do it on

379
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,380
your component itself because this

380
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,179
functions is going to call we call every

381
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,429
single vendor and you know that this

382
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:58,080
this transmission just have to happen

383
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,110
one single time so do it right after you

384
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,650
fetch it from your API or do it right at

385
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,029
the point where you get it from your

386
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:15,480
store okay so this is the definition of

387
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,840
one of our component I actually didn't

388
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,460
count how many from there it is doing a

389
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,740
code base I'm sorry so very bleak oi

390
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,929
this is God and a protocol lips so of

391
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:35,970
course I don't think any any any one of

392
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,350
us as engineers we want the design

393
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,480
things in this way but this this

394
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,720
component has grew and grew grown grew

395
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,279
grow so big as we add more and more

396
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,570
features and ok so let me show you how

397
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:59,070
it looks like ok so this is our input

398
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:03,960
text it's quite a monster so this error

399
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,450
message if you take it out there's no

400
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,299
error message and then there's a labor

401
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:14,640
so you see like when you and it is also

402
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,520
face holding at the same time and then

403
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,799
there's our prefix sometimes you don't

404
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,049
need prefixes so we get to get out we

405
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,210
have different sizes to cater to

406
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,549
different use case and then sometimes

407
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,000
you can okay this doesn't work at the

408
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,779
same time with area so haha and then you

409
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,990
can be savor it then you cannot type in

410
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:44,730
it anymore

411
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,330
okay so you see actually some of the

412
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,800
prompts work with each other very well

413
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,960
like if you have a icon laughs and the

414
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,800
arrow okay

415
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,720
probably the seduce kids worry a key now

416
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,400
and a placeholder probably is a use case

417
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,820
for it

418
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,790
but sometimes the prop that's a work

419
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,140
with each other that you have Auto

420
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,060
capitalized with a tight because it

421
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,280
he'll say what's happening you so

422
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,740
therefore like the ad who Pro is real

423
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,870
isn't it because there are two props on

424
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,150
the same element but they will never

425
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,830
work well with each other

426
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,240
and but to a engineer when you come in

427
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,040
your lady actually there or text input

428
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,380
one so I should just extend on my text

429
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,260
input and you realize actually a lot of

430
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,650
the props are optional this is how we

431
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,510
relate to like make ourselves feel

432
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,410
better like okay

433
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,060
the optional you know just I use it

434
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,410
nobody else use it but then why do you

435
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,960
want to put in the same component if

436
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,130
they are separate split them you know

437
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,360
create a new component don't don't be

438
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,700
shy about creating new components there

439
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,490
are actually ways in react that lets you

440
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,640
do this so that you can extend on a base

441
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,630
class and then you can have like a hello

442
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,960
phone in input text as a auto

443
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,390
capitalized simple text okay sure but

444
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,260
then one thing they work across

445
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,690
different framework is to then split

446
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,690
them create a new component even if it's

447
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,310
going to be duplicate code no don't be

448
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,160
shy about having to placate code of

449
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,200
course we always come from the framework

450
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,190
of clean code but in clean code at the

451
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,200
expense of like making it difficult to

452
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,110
use so the pro clips is a monster it's a

453
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,870
Frankenstein creature because all of us

454
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,270
we have so many web engineers all of us

455
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,410
are going to add on to the code based

456
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,800
thinking that it's gonna affect me but

457
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,840
someone else is gonna join the team

458
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,760
they're gonna come in and I can see your

459
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,940
component with 20 props and they will be

460
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,230
like

461
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,680
[Music]

462
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:58,290
this so I gotta end of my talk with this

463
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,770
suite that I just saw yesterday most of

464
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,710
my ideas are just not repeating previous

465
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,620
mistakes and I think a lot of us we come

466
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,440
and we go we listen to podcasts we come

467
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,470
to a conference thinking that you know

468
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,140
there's gonna be some words of wisdom

469
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,520
but I realized that a lot of time

470
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,210
guidelines is just one person's pain and

471
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,360
then they don't want to repeat that pain

472
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,810
anymore

473
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,960
so every one of you will have a

474
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,300
guideline that you want to share so

00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,940
