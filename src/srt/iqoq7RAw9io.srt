00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,259

I've been working in tech for a couple

2
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,680
years now as an engineer but previously

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,960
as a product manager but like a lot of

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,580
people my degree isn't in computer

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,189
science in the anthropology which is the

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,170
study of human societies and evolution

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,660
and I really like thinking about systems

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,460
of people and now I also really like

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,369
thinking about systems and programs and

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,649
I think that I really enjoy that a lot

11
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,440
of the talks today have are about like

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,559
user empathy and bringing that into our

13
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:41,850
technical process and I think

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,260
understanding people is the key to

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,620
building successful products and also to

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,870
architecting them the right way so this

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,969
talk is about the web norms of the world

18
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,940
and it's it's based on the premise that

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,110
websites and Technology are different

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,090
around the world and if you've traveled

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,489
to another continent on vacation you may

22
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,350
have experienced this when you try to

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,960
buy something look up an event go to a

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,330
museum or get train tickets and if

25
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,950
you're a multinational person this is

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,320
definitely no surprise to you and so I

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
just wanted to hop in and give it a

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,650
couple examples of how websites might

29
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,240
look and feel different in different

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,570
places so this is Rakuten which is the

31
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,200
top japanese ecommerce site it's it's

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,790
obviously a web site but there are some

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,030
differences first it's in Japanese

34
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,710
there's a lot of navigation options at

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,130
the top there aren't many large

36
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,900
drop-down menus and there's a lot of

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,720
icons pair of these navigation items and

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,780
the product images all have text baked

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,930
into them and if we compare that to a

40
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,090
site like Amazon in the US there are

41
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,369
fewer navigation elements the product

42
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,470
categories are hidden under one big

43
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,960
hamburger menu there's no text in the

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,090
product images the text is generally

45
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,039
larger it's more spread out

46
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,939
another example train travel is really

47
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,799
popular in Europe it's super normal to

48
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,210
jump on a train to go for a quick

49
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:03,960
vacation

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,710
this is France's train portal they offer

51
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,360
hotel deals and I've noticed that

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,119
European

53
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,860
transit sites have adopted this like

54
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,190
really friendly candy color bubble style

55
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,260
in their web design and I think it

56
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,500
reflects the like the popular consumer

57
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,430
nature of train travel so let's compare

58
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,170
it to Amtrak in the u.s. it's definitely

59
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,840
more serious in style there's less focus

60
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,280
on destinations there are no

61
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,099
destinations on their homepage I think

62
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,440
maybe it's a little more consumer sorry

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,310
commuter focused so I've started to

64
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,200
wonder why these websites are different

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,319
and I keep coming back to my educational

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,930
background and studying culture I always

67
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,459
thought that they were clear right and

68
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,879
wrong ways to make a website but when

69
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,470
you put it within an anthropological

70
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,040
lens there there isn't right it's it's

71
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,760
all within the context of each culture

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,950
and I think the the question is

73
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,390
analogous with asking why are people

74
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,549
around the world different it's which

75
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:07,540
scientists have been trying to answer

76
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,579
for hundreds of years so I will try to

77
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:14,410
do it in 30 minutes I've been told to

78
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,829
drink water so I think that the answer

79
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,989
is that technology is a mode of cultural

80
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:22,569
expression just like language or dancing

81
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,690
music food architecture it includes

82
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,760
people's customs their lifestyles how

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,129
they orient themselves to the world and

84
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,810
I think even our technical decisions the

85
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,790
ones we make every day from the

86
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,599
programming languages to the frameworks

87
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,060
deb services to the design and colors we

88
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,220
choose are all driven by a combination

89
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,410
of social factors that are unique to

90
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,489
each of our own cultures so why is this

91
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,530
important to talk about why can't people

92
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,120
just figure it out for themselves right

93
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,430
like I'm familiar with the us's culture

94
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,709
i can build websites and products for

95
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,139
people in the US there's a butch reasons

96
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,780
the first is that computer and Internet

97
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,430
technology is totally not really

98
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,280
globalized it's globalized better and

99
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,470
faster than any other technology and we

100
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,299
all rely on the same foundational

101
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,489
elements for building software like

102
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:14,349
operating systems programming languages

103
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,359
open source projects you'll find react

104
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,100
developers in every core

105
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,560
of the world and global software

106
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,350
corporations have already become really

107
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,390
huge and multinational just look at

108
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,960
Google and Facebook Amazon Web Services

109
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,780
people across the world use iPhones

110
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,820
develop Apple in California many people

111
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,590
use I've Android phones that are built

112
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,790
in China Japan and Korea and the world

113
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,740
is coming more online the digital the

114
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,470
digital divide refers to the gap between

115
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,750
people who have access to the Internet

116
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,320
and those who don't is shrinking so in

117
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,610
1990 the internet was not very popular

118
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,650
over the last couple decades it's grown

119
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,660
tremendously now there are three and a

120
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,190
half billion people with internet access

121
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,620
and that's only that's actually slightly

122
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,650
under half of the world's population

123
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,240
some researchers claim total Internet

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,220
adoption between 2030 and 2040 and

125
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,450
emerging economies are adopting the

126
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,550
internet at exponential rates like India

127
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,620
I mean even countries like Bangladesh

128
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,140
and Ghana which are small compared to

129
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,000
India just in population have doubled

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,410
the number of Internet connected users

131
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,380
in the past couple years and this is

132
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,480
bringing new users an opportunity to

133
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,070
these countries to the Internet

134
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,930
it's creating more demand for developers

135
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,880
and services locally and globally in as

136
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,100
developers we benefit from having more

137
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,570
developers and being connected with each

138
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,490
other around the world we can share code

139
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,680
we can learn from each other we go to

140
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,650
each other's conferences innovations

141
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,000
that are made in one part of the world

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,830
can make a big difference in another

143
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,360
part of the world and I think that well

144
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,940
localized software that really meets the

145
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,130
needs of people in each of these areas

146
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,160
will ultimately win so products that

147
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,800
don't meet meet users needs like having

148
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,050
offline support choosing but making a

149
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,760
smart choice between building a desktop

150
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,690
or mobile or not translating well will

151
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,460
cause the product and not connect with

152
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,770
local users and because the in it

153
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,720
because Internet companies are uniquely

154
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,690
able to like target new customers in

155
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,060
global markets I think all of us as

156
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,890
developers will need to learn how to

157
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,260
internationalize properly

158
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,670
think about different cultures around

159
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,770
the world and this includes things like

160
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,600
open-source software which already

161
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,850
totally globally shared I really like

162
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,320
this example this is the Twitter

163
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,690
chronological timeline example where

164
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,540
they switch the feed from time order to

165
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,280
algorithmic I think it shows that

166
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,070
culture extends to how people want to

167
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,020
use technology and how much trust they

168
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,330
have in it and the fact that they

169
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,470
backtracked I think shows that

170
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,260
ultimately software will have to bend to

171
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:05,050
human culture and needs so how can we

172
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,490
make more culturally sensitive

173
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,160
technology I think we can start by

174
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,600
understanding the like the different

175
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,750
factors that developers can consider

176
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,110
when building software the first one is

177
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,270
language so language is the core thing

178
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,160
we do every day it's how we talk to each

179
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,460
other it includes coding language

180
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,440
affects how we design websites it

181
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,700
affects whether you can read the

182
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,740
technical docs for a new language or

183
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,490
framework you want to try the second are

184
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,010
cultural attitudes which are how much do

185
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,200
people trust the Internet are they

186
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,820
willing to put their credit cards in on

187
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,980
to buy something online are they open to

188
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,720
trying new things do they have

189
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,300
established customs already how much do

190
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,610
they care about like lots of rules in

191
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,370
order what are their lifestyles like and

192
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,170
how they integrated the internet and

193
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,920
technology into it the next one is

194
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,990
government policy so some countries

195
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,270
restrict the internet others enforce

196
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,060
regulations to preserve privacy and

197
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,860
other countries don't protect their

198
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,770
internet freedoms enough and the final

199
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,450
one is Internet infrastructure so who is

200
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,980
on the Internet in the first place is

201
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,560
the connectivity widespread is available

202
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,510
everywhere is it stable or as an

203
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,450
intermittent so I want to go through

204
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,400
each one of these and provide lots of

205
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,800
examples and talk about how developers

206
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,840
around the world handle these different

207
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,990
factors so the first is that language

208
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,150
affects how user interface is designed

209
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,970
adults there are a lot of languages

210
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,220
there are over 7,000 known languages

211
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,160
this is one of my favorite maps and each

212
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,690
one of these languages has their own

213
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,320
writing systems

214
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,329
one example is Hangul which is the

215
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:47,509
primary korean writing system and when

216
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,279
you take all the Hangul characters and

217
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,290
put it into a unicode block you get a

218
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,529
block that's about 11,000 glyphs large

219
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:59,180
so there's a lot of them and there's

220
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,310
challenges to using font faces with

221
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,290
thousands of characters it makes it

222
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,209
really expensive to design them which

223
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,579
makes it expensive to license them this

224
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:09,410
means that historically there have been

225
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,040
limited selection of the font faces that

226
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,139
are web-safe and common across devices

227
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,899
and moreover the files containing these

228
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,880
font faces are really huge they can

229
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,370
reach like 15 megabytes in size compared

230
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,529
to just like a Latin alphabet alphabet

231
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,470
font face which could be like 400 or 500

232
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,810
kilobytes and that can be a huge

233
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,339
deal-breaker especially if you're trying

234
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,220
to load these on mobile so these

235
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,279
limitations require clever workarounds

236
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,199
one very common workaround is to display

237
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:42,199
text and images this is a this is a

238
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,709
Korean ecommerce site Gmarket in all the

239
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,750
text on this website in the navigation

240
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,110
our images and our huge benefits to this

241
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,779
it moves faster you can ensure the

242
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:56,149
quality the text rendering it's going to

243
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,440
look the same across browsers one method

244
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,019
to natively render fonts is called sub

245
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,600
setting this can speed it up so sub sets

246
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,850
are just like slices of a font file down

247
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,500
to just the characters you need to load

248
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,540
to show the characters on the page there

249
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,190
are some really cool solutions out there

250
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,740
a group of Korean designers and

251
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,319
developers added Korean fonts to the

252
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,569
google fonts project it uses machine

253
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:26,180
learning driven sub setting to group

254
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,730
commonly seen characters together to

255
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,130
reduce load times and when it's served

256
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,529
over the google fonts API if benefits

257
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,870
from cross-site caching so a user would

258
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,060
only need to load the font once in order

259
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:46,169
to see it across many web sites

260
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,679
okay so there's there's other languages

261
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,800
like Arabic and Hebrew they're read from

262
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,019
right to left and these require flipped

263
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,949
layouts that are called bi-directional

264
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,329
so anything that naturally goes on the

265
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,459
left in English like on the television

266
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,339
music art website when it's translated

267
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,569
into Hebrew would be totally mirror and

268
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,579
everything has to be mirrored down to

269
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:14,839
the navigation there are some CSS

270
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,189
frameworks that can be used to achieve

271
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:19,009
this like right-to-left CSS this will

272
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,799
automatically flip any directional CSS

273
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,199
property so like border left or margin

274
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,149
right would be automatically flipped and

275
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,999
but you can also specify like manual

276
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:33,279
processors to do this the next is that

277
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,629
text text also takes up a different

278
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,399
matter of space when you translate it

279
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,899
and I think that this could contribute

280
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,839
to some interpretations of like

281
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,670
non-english language web sites is maybe

282
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,579
cluttered or busy I see that on the web

283
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,749
but really I think it's a difference in

284
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,699
writing system and a lack of familiarity

285
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:52,850
and so the word views is actually three

286
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,649
times longer in Italian than it is in

287
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,069
English and just in my own informal test

288
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,920
this Thai translation of programming is

289
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,379
very fun and cool is 1.7 times the space

290
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:07,819
so if you're good to localize your

291
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:09,949
project it has to go further than

292
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:12,230
translating strings you can't translate

293
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,269
your translate your English site to

294
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:15,889
Arabic without building a bi-directional

295
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,559
layout and you have to account for the

296
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,779
expansion and contraction of text when

297
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,559
you translate it as well

298
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,660
so we're building interfaces to support

299
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,679
different languages

300
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,049
and but we know there are over 7,000 of

301
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,439
them and the application programming we

302
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,720
do like writing web apps in languages

303
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,839
like JavaScript all use abstractions in

304
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,720
English terminology so all the reserved

305
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,480
words in JavaScript are English and this

306
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,309
is even the case for languages like Ruby

307
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:48,980
which was invented in Japan and it was

308
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,990
five years between Ruby's invention and

309
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,850
the first English language book that was

310
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,460
published

311
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,880
but if we look at the top spoken

312
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,650
languages in the world we can see how

313
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,810
much of a disconnect there is right like

314
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,970
English is no more commonly spoken than

315
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,370
Hindi or really Arabic and much lesser

316
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:12,940
than Chinese click so what's happened is

317
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,280
that English has become a lingua franca

318
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,610
or a common or trade language for

319
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,010
computing it's kind of similar to Latin

320
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,610
in the Roman Empire who conquered their

321
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,800
way around a spread Latin everywhere or

322
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,500
Italian and music theory and adopting

323
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,080
common languages both spoken languages

324
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,150
and programming languages does have a

325
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,310
lot of benefits it makes it easier to

326
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,250
share code and communicate I don't have

327
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,830
to translate your piece of code into my

328
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,300
language in order to run it or

329
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,330
understand it and it makes it easier for

330
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,730
our work to be cumulative as developers

331
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,260
around the world and we can grow the

332
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,450
entire pie in software rather than

333
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,480
developing technology in parallel

334
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,830
specific to each language group so given

335
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,820
the prevalence of English and

336
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,010
programming and also in international

337
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,920
trade and diplomacy it goes the English

338
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,510
is the most studied language in the

339
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,310
world even though it's not the most

340
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,290
spoken language but also I think we can

341
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,270
also admit that code is not really

342
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:16,660
English

343
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,690
I don't know what a graph means but I do

344
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,230
know what it does I have been writing a

345
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,300
rough since I was like 12 and I don't

346
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,970
still don't know what it is so these

347
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,890
terms might be derived from English but

348
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,600
you can code without learning to speak

349
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,730
it although you do have to become

350
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,030
familiar with the Latin alphabet I think

351
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,800
I would describe code as a new dialect

352
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,970
of English in many ways some programming

353
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,030
tools skip English based code altogether

354
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,060
though this is scratch with which is a

355
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,850
block based programming tool developed

356
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,420
at MIT it's used by kids in schools and

357
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,700
museums around the world about half of

358
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,830
the scratch users are out of the US and

359
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,350
Europe and the block abstraction makes

360
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,330
it really easy to translate each of

361
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,540
these logical blocks into and

362
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,340
foreign language and research done by

363
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,130
MIT has shown that kids do learn how to

364
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,110
code faster when they use their native

365
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,830
language and also just because reserved

366
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,410
words in in the programming language

367
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,140
languages we use are in English doesn't

368
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,420
mean they can't be replaced and so this

369
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,460
is a project called your lang which is a

370
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,010
node like language in Yoruba which is a

371
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,800
language spoken in Nigeria and projects

372
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,000
like these I think could help

373
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,070
non-english speakers get into

374
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,170
programming in the beginning but I would

375
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,810
also love to see a future where were

376
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,420
able to inner translate languages like

377
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,870
these like I don't see why we couldn't

378
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,040
translate these reserved words back in

379
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,050
English or into any other language and

380
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:53,790
run it developers also want to read

381
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,250
documents documentation and debug issues

382
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,100
in their native language so this is

383
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,080
especially important for developers who

384
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,480
don't speak English translations

385
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,030
channels for discussing programming and

386
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,770
computing in your native language

387
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,950
benefits everybody and it's great for

388
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,780
non-english speaking developers it's

389
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,790
actually critical and they are already

390
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,480
doing it but also by adding these kinds

391
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,700
of spaces and translations to

392
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,830
open-source projects can draw more

393
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,720
developers into the project and make it

394
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,300
more inclusive and people find

395
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,400
translations so valuable that they will

396
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,830
do it themselves Docs china is an

397
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,990
aggregator of chinese translations of

398
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,510
open-source projects which many of us

399
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,100
were familiar with a lot of these in

400
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,100
this list I think this is really cool I

401
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,470
think that people are doing this for

402
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,200
every major language but there are some

403
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,280
problems with these unofficial

404
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,200
translations right there less

405
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,030
discoverable they're not attached to the

406
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,060
main project website and there's more

407
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,950
opportunity for them to grow stale as

408
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,030
the base library changes and there are

409
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,540
ways to improve this right so the react

410
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,690
project has led a project to add

411
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,240
translations to their core documentation

412
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,640
I think doing that is a really good way

413
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,280
to recognize that you have an

414
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,070
international community and now Allison

415
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,160
built a bot to open pull requests

416
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,340
in each translation whenever changes are

417
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,510
made to the English Doc's

418
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,090
I know that this was inspired by the UJS

419
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,860
team I think it's a really great

420
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,140
strategy for keeping translations up to

421
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,040
date but also keeping it together in the

422
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,250
in the main project UJS also has a

423
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,350
discord server it includes native

424
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,080
language channels this gives folks an

425
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,940
entry point to find help and connect

426
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,040
with other devs from their area I also

427
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,660
know that there's a really strong view

428
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,000
jeaious Japan user group and they have

429
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,410
their own slack channel organized

430
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,320
translations of sort of ancillary vue.js

431
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,900
libraries and blog posts and community

432
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,990
events so incorporating those I think

433
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,150
can go a long way to making sure

434
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,460
everybody is heard and included in your

435
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,710
project so cultural attitudes play a big

436
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,020
role in how technology is used these are

437
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,120
things these are the beliefs people have

438
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,610
their lifestyles their taboos what's

439
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,040
okay what's not okay and all the other

440
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,310
values that each culture holds and it's

441
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,190
really hard to quantify anthropologists

442
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,540
and researchers have been trying to do

443
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,000
it for a long time there's a framework

444
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,950
called Hofstede's cultural dimensions

445
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,120
which is used in some marketing research

446
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,370
in e-commerce research it's not perfect

447
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,590
I really don't like the nurture versus

448
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,010
power gendered dimension but I think it

449
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,840
can help think about how different

450
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,760
societies approach life overall

451
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,590
so some societies might be more

452
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,390
comfortable with uncertain situations

453
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,280
some might be more focused on

454
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,080
maintaining tradition others are more

455
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,330
future oriented some care about

456
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,760
collective success others on individual

457
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,730
success and it gives us a framework to

458
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,490
compare different nations cultures in a

459
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,860
more objective way or seemingly

460
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,010
objective way so for example Egypt Japan

461
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,510
and Russia all have really high

462
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,390
uncertainty avoidance in this study

463
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,550
compared to the u.s. whereas the u.s. is

464
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,260
really highly indulgent in the

465
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,920
individualist um and I think that these

466
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,510
kinds of differences show up in

467
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,460
subconscious ways and the way that

468
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,130
technology and websites are built this

469
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,380
is a website for purchasing tickets for

470
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,550
the Ghibli Museum New York Tokyo

471
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,430
it's a notoriously busy museum it's hard

472
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,160
to look up it books out months in

473
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,560
advance and on tourist site it's really

474
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,500
common to see all the information laid

475
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,320
out with step-by-step instructions with

476
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,990
screenshots on how to use the software

477
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,880
and all the information is spelled out

478
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,620
really clearly so even if you don't get

479
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,530
in you know why and let's compare it to

480
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,320
the bird museum in LA and once you dig

481
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,630
into the site you realize if you don't

482
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,920
buy a ticket you're gonna have to stand

483
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,050
in line and you start to see all of this

484
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,930
uncertain language like the chance of

485
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,430
getting into this exhibit or the

486
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,910
probability of seeing this this one so

487
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,500
you don't actually know first if you can

488
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,960
get into the museum when you go and you

489
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,400
don't know if you'll be able to see all

490
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,230
the exhibits and I don't know if this

491
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,540
would fly in a country with high

492
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,140
avoidance of uncertain situations and

493
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:35,370
you get comments like faces it really

494
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,320
grows on you it takes a second you're

495
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,760
like okay I have an example personally

496
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,040
at my company ribbon I work on tools

497
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,430
that help people purchase homes so the

498
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,170
team designed and built this really

499
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,650
elaborate sales funnel tracking tool it

500
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,930
was well spaced I think pretty well

501
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,690
designed but the the users our team kept

502
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,820
going back to Google sheets they kept

503
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,740
asking for like additional information

504
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,270
and we would say just click the name of

505
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,030
the buyer and go to the detail page so

506
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,590
but then they kept going back and like

507
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,960
doing all this data entry and eventually

508
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,740
we gave up we replaced it with this it's

509
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,050
an embedded spreadsheet from our bi tool

510
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,780
called periscope and it turns out what

511
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,070
they actually needed was something

512
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,350
really compact with no scrolling and

513
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,050
highly flexible so they can add any

514
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,850
columns that they wanted without asking

515
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,420
us and so by throwing out what we

516
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,030
thought was a really nice product and

517
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,200
replacing it with their presumably worse

518
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,410
and uglier one actually better methods

519
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,420
with the team

520
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,320
another example on the cultural

521
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,080
dimension scale China is a very low

522
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,660
uncertainty avoidance country and really

523
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,150
high on future orientation which means

524
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,130
they're more willing to deal with

525
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,800
ambiguity and very adaptable to changing

526
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,230
technology for comparison the United

527
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,420
States scores very low on future

528
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,130
orientation it's more stuck in

529
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,970
preserving tradition and so we see that

530
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,010
payments everywhere in China from Street

531
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,930
markets to taxis to restaurants are now

532
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,690
being made through QR codes and payments

533
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,970
in an app called WeChat which is totally

534
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,400
ubiquitous for social networking and

535
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,010
payments it's an app that has a billion

536
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,120
users which is crazy this came about

537
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,310
years before we started to see this pop

538
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,950
up in the US with companies like

539
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,620
snapchat and venmo and we're really

540
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,920
starting to see China rapidly outpace

541
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,320
technological innovation in the u.s.

542
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,820
when this changes how you actually

543
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,550
launch startups and so Chinese startups

544
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,230
will start to make these light web apps

545
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,900
before they make desktop apps these are

546
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,910
meant to be accessed via QR codes and

547
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,520
load-in we chats browser so this is me

548
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,080
looking at it and recording it from my

549
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,820
desktop site and that's why there's a

550
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,110
black bar on the right you're just not

551
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,040
supposed to look at it from your

552
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,980
computer

553
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,290
another final silly example of this just

554
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,900
to bring it back home this is the Sunday

555
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,190
comics

556
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,860
I love reading comics I think you get a

557
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,990
good mix it's all really pretty and

558
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,210
brightly colored and compact and this is

559
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,070
what happens when you translate it to

560
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,890
the web without fully thinking through

561
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,400
how people might like to read comics and

562
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,500
I think that it's missing a little bit

563
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,720
of the heart of how people want to read

564
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,070
comics so the third factor is that the

565
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,170
Internet is not totally free all

566
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,450
Internet infrastructure is ultimately

567
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,820
provided through private companies and

568
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,820
so it's subject to national laws one

569
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,380
example in recent history is China

570
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,810
blocking Google api's for us and

571
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,670
developers to find mirrors and

572
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,800
alternatives the latest status now is

573
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,730
that they're being served through

574
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,270
Beijing servers in Europe there's laws

575
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,330
called gdpr which forces European sites

576
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,240
to ask for users consent to use cookies

577
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,180
and in South Korea there are strict

578
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,850
regulations on online payments so for

579
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,100
years users have needed to use Internet

580
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,640
Explorer download ActiveX executable

581
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,950
files and manage local certificates to

582
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,080
authenticate desktop payments and this

583
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,030
is definitely changing

584
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,470
but it has also pushed a lot of online

585
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,280
payments to mobile and some kind of

586
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,870
sometimes countries fight and levy

587
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,360
sanctions against each other just

588
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,370
recently an Iranian developer named

589
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,650
Shaheen wrote this blog post about the

590
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,660
effects of the recent sanctions by the

591
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,810
US the sanctions brought down sites in

592
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,520
these countries they restricted access

593
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,190
to services like gitlab docker Android

594
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,560
dev it requires developers to use

595
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,620
proxies and VPNs to bypass the sanctions

596
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,290
which is questionably illegal for these

597
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,220
developers and dangerous for them to do

598
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,420
github has had to comply with the

599
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,690
sanctions they restricted developers

600
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,730
access to private repositories and

601
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,940
gist's it was done so abruptly but these

602
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,170
sanctions are painful for everybody

603
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,880
nobody wants to break the law right and

604
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,220
including github who would get in

605
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,860
trouble for not complying with them so

606
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,500
it's a really sticky situation a bunch

607
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,180
of devs banded together to make this

608
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,390
github do not ban us repo and github did

609
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,400
soften their restrictions and make it

610
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,560
easier to recover from but this is going

611
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,310
to continue to be a problem and the the

612
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,350
final category is Internet

613
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,210
infrastructure it's very different

614
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,210
across the world so if we look at

615
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,430
desktop versus mobile across the world

616
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,190
we can see that overall Africa and Asia

617
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,880
are much more heavy on mobile Internet

618
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,540
traffic in India 70% of visits visits

619
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,130
were mobile to sites using the

620
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,650
StatCounter analytics tool and the u.s.

621
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,050
it's more 50/50 so you can imagine that

622
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,400
if you were launching a product in a

623
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,320
place like India you would start with a

624
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,120
mobile experience rather than a desktop

625
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,710
one and broadband access which is

626
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,300
defined as like high-speed stable

627
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,730
Internet is also not equally distributed

628
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,890
there's a really big gulf in broadband

629
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,810
access between the developed and the

630
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,900
developing

631
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,150
developing worlds and people in rural

632
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,280
rural areas in every country also

633
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,810
frequently experienced low connectivity

634
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,520
so there are projects from giants like

635
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,050
Google and Facebook trying to bring

636
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,870
connectivity to these places - like

637
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,310
varying degrees of success

638
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,680
but also these countries are rapidly

639
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,840
trying and doing a lot of work to build

640
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,790
in an infrastructure themselves that's

641
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,930
the primary way people are coming online

642
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,900
so places without stable internet

643
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,610
experience slower speeds and

644
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,470
intermittent connections that drop in

645
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,390
and out this can make using apps and

646
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,790
websites really frustrating so

647
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,110
developers can improve the user

648
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,480
experience in these places by offering

649
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,460
offline support using techniques like

650
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,980
local storage and service workers to

651
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,160
cache to cache data locally and build

652
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,100
progressive web apps to turn our web

653
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,520
apps into seemingly native mobile apps

654
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,400
there's actually a talk here at the

655
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,050
conference on day two about this I'm

656
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,110
really excited to go to that one this is

657
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,230
a screenshot of the Africa so Kony

658
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,670
progressive web app it's a Kenyan online

659
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,370
marketplace and so all you have to do is

660
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,830
hit share and add to homescreen and it

661
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,410
becomes able to cache content locally

662
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,810
and use service workers to keep that

663
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,930
functional and while the connection is

664
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,320
either stable or drops in and out these

665
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,850
kinds of apps also take up less space

666
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,950
the native apps which could be important

667
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,740
for users that may have may be using

668
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,260
budget phones and it's really well

669
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,480
documented that companies that launch

670
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,670
these progressive web apps see huge

671
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:49,200
gains and usage and conversion so that's

672
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,720
a really whirlwind tour of just a small

673
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,500
selection of the types of challenges and

674
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,060
solutions that developers around the

675
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,250
world are using really each of these

676
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,870
categories could probably be their own

677
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,730
dissertation I find it really

678
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,830
fascinating but I also think that

679
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,780
there's ways we can apply this to our

680
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,810
everyday work the first is that I don't

681
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,210
think user empathy is just for product

682
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,760
managers or designers we can use it to

683
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,370
make the right technical decisions for

684
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,980
the platforms we build for our products

685
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,990
and for our open-source software we can

686
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,500
use it also to localize to our own users

687
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,660
and making sure we understand what our

688
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,669
users needs really are like in the

689
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:31,950
example with replacing our tool with a

690
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,530
spreadsheet and if you know that your

691
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,030
company will be expanding into new

692
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,049
markets or already has users in

693
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,610
international and other markets you can

694
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,830
architect your application in a way to

695
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,780
reach those people in the way that

696
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,299
they're most comfortable and I believe

697
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,280
that the people who do this will win the

698
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,620
will win the hearts of users and benefit

699
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,600
the most from the growth of the Internet

700
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,380
connected population we can also support

701
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,080
our friends around the world we can

702
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,120
think about and include developers who

703
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,250
might not have the same access a lot of

704
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,809
tech companies are based in San

705
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:09,480
Francisco we can make translations a

706
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,940
priority we can work on if we if you

707
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,010
work on developer services or open

708
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,049
source projects I think you should look

709
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:18,000
into some of the successful patterns we

710
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,669
talked about like building translations

711
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:23,040
into your project and you can start

712
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,510
small by linking to unofficial

713
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,370
translations and starting to find

714
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,610
partners in the international community

715
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,140
and finally I think sanctions and

716
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,570
censorship are especially hard to fix as

717
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,090
individuals but we can try to give we

718
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,190
can give platforms to our friends who

719
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,830
are affected by them and we can make

720
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,600
noise and we can push companies with

721
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,510
power like Microsoft who owns github to

722
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:49,080
stand up against them and finally when

723
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,150
you come across a website or an app that

724
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,980
isn't what you're used to whether it's

725
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,190
local or foreign try to think about the

726
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,380
cultural context in which it was made

727
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,270
this is a concept called cultural

728
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,309
relativity it's a really core

729
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,470
anthropological concept that helps you

730
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,530
stay objective and helps you avoid using

731
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,870
loaded terms to describe UI as like

732
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,530
cluttered or text axes old when it may

733
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,630
be a lack of context and understanding

734
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,760
and we can use this to be more inclusive

735
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,160
and empathetic with each other and I

736
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,720
think to build the right thing for

737
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,490
people so I think we can embrace culture

738
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,200
in our technical practice and remember

739
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,330
that technology is really deeply

740
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,880
intertwined with culture and use it to

741
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,600
your advantage

742
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,340
