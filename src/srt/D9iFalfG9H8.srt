1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140

i turn my camera on I keep my fingers

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:18,210
away I'm ritesh that's me in the arrow

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,170
right there all right here okay I work

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,510
at a red mark and I do front end and

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,170
DevOps so red mark where we think we're

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,910
the leading or online grocer in

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,700
Singapore we're really building the next

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,100
generation ecommerce platform called

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,530
everything from erp warehouse transport

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,350
logistics we even have robotic trolleys

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,739
and we do all that in house we're more

12
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,289
than just website and API but on top of

13
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,550
all that we actually a startup so today

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,930
I want to talk about how we really

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,539
develop features at red matte I like to

16
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,770
think that we have a workflow that

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,090
really gets code into production fast to

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,280
do this we really have like a no top of

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,070
action approach I mean I now I now I

20
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,500
realize that this is a real bad slide to

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,310
have when you're actually giving a talk

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,990
but really what I'm trying to say is

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,439
that we try to encourage lesser meetings

24
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,150
with this workflow and improve

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,560
productivity and I want to share a

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,720
little bit about that hopefully with

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,850
this top you can apply some of this work

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,850
flows voice for your own team but if not

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,740
then anything else at least you'll get

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,170
to hear about a real world development

31
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,500
workflow of a scaling startup right so

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,100
cool let's get started raise of hands

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,360
how many you guys have seen this site

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,159
all right cool I mean I think it's

35
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,470
pretty cool like especially the CSS

36
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,409
animations stuff like people you know in

37
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,159
Singapore they will go like dem paola

38
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,149
and I I mean I totally dig it and now

39
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,920
let's see let's see if we can replicate

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,110
it on red Mile all right let's try and

41
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,030
do that and bear with me I think the

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,130
more challenging part here will be me

43
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,170
switching around the displace rather

44
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,070
than actually doing the deployment

45
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,320
so on this on this site as you guys have

46
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,080
been going to every single day this

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,250
fancy animation is really cool and we

48
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,340
have this page on red mark let me see if

49
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,750
you scroll down all the way to the

50
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,910
bottom and click on this link we have a

51
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,700
human's foul and I want to like have

52
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,920
this kind of fancy stuff happening on

53
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,620
this page as well so let's see if we can

54
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,170
if we can do that okay so i actually

55
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,750
went in and cheated a little bit

56
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,620
obviously looked at the code and stuff

57
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,980
and they have a key frame of smash let's

58
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:03,420
add that

59
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,030
ok but

60
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,160
and she can say that before that I what

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,020
I want to do is really i want to start

62
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,730
developing this feature so what i'm

63
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,250
going to do is within my repository i'm

64
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,700
going to do get flow feature start GS

65
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:32,110
conf oops alright cool i'm already there

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,340
all right actually what let me just copy

67
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,760
the whole damn thing and we have a grunt

68
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,959
task obviously running in the background

69
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,900
and it looks to be okay or what I'm

70
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:53,520
going to do is see whether that works

71
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,400
hmm what happened to this guy office

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,350
goes wrong when you are in front of

73
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:12,370
people

74
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,890
okay so

75
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,290
so what I'm going to do okay let's just

76
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,350
imagine that worked okay and what I'm

77
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:32,100
going to do is push it so get push

78
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,250
alright

79
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,480
and then what we're going to go what

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,280
that happens is like the whole build

81
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,450
process will kick in and if you go into

82
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:51,570
here

83
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,520
you are because I created a branch a

84
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,979
feature branch of juice corn cheat it's

85
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:00,669
automatically deployed to this server

86
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:02,830
and then any so anybody can basically

87
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:28,959
access it and there you go

88
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:30,979
so then what I'll do it I'll just ask

89
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,249
one of my colleagues here to help me

90
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:57,439
merge this request

91
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:02,819
major panic and automatically you can

92
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,229
see like because the build process has

93
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,979
passed it lets us know that you know

94
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,129
this is a safe this is safe too much oh

95
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:16,650
wait I'm sorry it's still building and

96
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,719
pause it looks good are you going to

97
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,189
merge that I don't want to be

98
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:29,219
responsible no just kidding okay so well

99
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:35,400
well give me a yay so while well my

100
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,139
colleague goes ahead and add much is

101
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:50,119
that we'll get back to it

102
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,990
yeah the deployment side is going to

103
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,159
take like a minute or two so I look

104
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:58,750
right back but basically that's done

105
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,300
like and howdy and what do we what just

106
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,509
happened like I spent really more time

107
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,099
figuring out about the projector stuff

108
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:10,780
and panicking about coding but

109
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,520
essentially you're able to deploy a

110
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,830
feature into production really really

111
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,800
fast and I know I mean you're thinking

112
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,469
this was it staged it wasn't really a

113
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:22,780
feature it was just like some fancy CSS

114
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,259
stuff but I'd say I still think it was

115
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:37,690
pretty cool where's my applause team and

116
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,030
in case you're still not convinced let

117
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,680
me tell you like a little bit of a story

118
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,440
and why why it's specifically cool about

119
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,669
Redman and it's about this thing product

120
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:49,810
market fit and I know you're wondering

121
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,879
like what's this douche talking about

122
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,620
product market fit energy as cold like

123
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,409
seriously what's up with this guy but

124
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,930
just like bear with me okay because I

125
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,729
think many of us here are working at

126
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,039
startups and and for me personally I'm

127
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,430
quite fascinated on how business &

128
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,250
Company dynamics impact you know the

129
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,629
developers because like really company

130
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,650
scale bro and if and if you're lucky and

131
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,740
people start using your product and a

132
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,360
trademark we count ourselves fortunate

133
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,800
that we are one of those companies

134
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,430
you're going to scale from like ten

135
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,379
202,000 to 10,000 like users orders

136
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,419
messages whatever I mean whatever the

137
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:33,310
scale of your measure is and as a result

138
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,529
I mean you're going to raise money you

139
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,060
more awesome people are going to join

140
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,060
your team and to sustain the growth and

141
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,829
sustain the users you want to be

142
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:43,360
developing a lot more features and

143
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,920
what's going to happen is you're going

144
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,310
to have you're going to have a lot of

145
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,860
developers working on a lot of multiple

146
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,480
features at the same time and we know

147
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,810
when we do that it's going to result in

148
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,610
a lot of merge hell's a lot of

149
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,350
dependency issues a lot of versioning

150
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,990
problems and that gets magnified

151
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,940
with more people that join I mean like

152
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,339
with a few people it's it's ok but as

153
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,670
and more people join that the problem

154
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,860
gets amplified and we really need to

155
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,610
tackle that but not only are they like

156
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,339
developer issues we also have like other

157
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:19,899
stakeholders other people they join you

158
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,880
know it's not just developers and I

159
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,360
think it's more specifically more the

160
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,430
case for red month because we really

161
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,459
have a lot of multiple systems like the

162
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:34,360
ERP warehouse automation transport

163
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,770
logistics which we all build software

164
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,200
software for in-house I'm not saying

165
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,670
that we have the most complex systems

166
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,350
obviously we just were just a start-up

167
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,440
but even if our systems are not the same

168
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,450
and it's different but the issue of

169
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,520
communicating changes effectively and

170
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,010
efficiently it still applies to I think

171
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,279
everyone because I mean as the team

172
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,959
skills you really realize that like

173
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,970
huddling around developers really

174
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,860
doesn't work anymore I mean so many of

175
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,779
us have had that experience where you

176
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,610
know there's somebody carding over your

177
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,290
shoulder trying to get some update and

178
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,079
you know it's just like is this done or

179
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,089
and looking at the code I mean they

180
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:11,290
might just think like you know most of

181
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,790
them they just think like it's a matrix

182
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,649
and it looks really fancy and they're

183
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,720
entertained by that but really it's

184
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,020
freaking annoying and what still is like

185
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,640
when somebody's looking over and like

186
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,320
you know can you change the hex code of

187
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,440
that to that and like no man I mean it's

188
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,839
not productive it's like total waste of

189
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,630
my time and on the other hand like

190
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,370
instead of them coming to you you go

191
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,110
over to them all the time and you bring

192
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,149
your laptop over every now and then that

193
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:38,620
doesn't scale either because we really

194
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,800
can use our time more efficiently and

195
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,450
this is super important because if we

196
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,930
don't take care of this we don't figure

197
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,940
out what's an efficient way to get stuff

198
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,300
out and communicated we're going to end

199
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,950
up with spending a lot of more times in

200
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,800
meetings and writing less code and that

201
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,220
is really depressing I mean it's like in

202
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,750
fact it's so depressing that we actually

203
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,149
come up with the theory you know this

204
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:08,110
guy right famous pretty much came up

205
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,990
with this a mass energy equation we have

206
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,630
another theory and we call it actually

207
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,590
we don't even have a name for

208
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,450
we'll just call it the thought area or

209
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,940
the lightning theory whatever and this

210
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,740
basically means that the environment

211
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,720
that developers love or productive

212
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,430
environment is directly proportionate to

213
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,080
the cold code that they write per day

214
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,180
and inversely proportional to the

215
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,500
meetings that they attend per day and

216
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,130
this is true like this is totally true

217
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,380
thank you thank you that's totally my

218
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,120
rig audience but I appreciate it anyway

219
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,140
so just quickly recap company scale

220
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,630
usually results in more meetings more

221
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,260
branch mess we need to fight that

222
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,910
empowering developers to work on as many

223
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,950
features as possible at once so that

224
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,020
they can write more code and not have to

225
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,900
spend too much time communicating to so

226
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,910
that we can reduce meetings in select is

227
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,600
very important but how do we do that how

228
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,920
do we empower multi feature development

229
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,450
by multiple developers at the same time

230
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,610
and the answer released for us at least

231
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,610
it starts with get flow and most of you

232
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,440
know I mean you probably know what gate

233
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,500
flow is and again like bear with me okay

234
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,800
and for the for the sake of those who

235
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,930
don't I just want to do a quick repack

236
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,080
recap and give that get flow is

237
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,570
basically a branching model it's a

238
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,100
convention that everybody and your team

239
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,210
will adopt and just helps to ensure same

240
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,770
branching state for our purposes the

241
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,960
fundamental block is really the feature

242
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,450
branches feature branches are basically

243
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,760
where you write all your code it's based

244
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,820
off the developed branch you work on

245
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,440
this every single day for example in the

246
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,110
feature 4gs conf you would do a feature

247
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,070
flow get flow features comp and what

248
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,810
this does is just basically takes

249
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,820
develop and creates a new branch and

250
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,240
checks it out automatically for you once

251
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,290
you're done with the feature you

252
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,060
basically merge it back in to develop

253
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,130
and that's why the develop branch is the

254
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,410
integration branch it's where all your

255
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,210
features get much into ones they've

256
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,290
finished like for example when you

257
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,450
finish off the GS con feature you just

258
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,370
do a feature floor finish and what this

259
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:27,920
does

260
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,740
it checks out develop it merges GS count

261
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,360
back in to develop and deletes this

262
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,620
feature branch release branch there's

263
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,690
another one where you want where you

264
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,089
want to combine a set of features this

265
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:43,250
is particularly useful has been useful

266
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,250
for us when you want to stage completed

267
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,420
features that you want to deploy later

268
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,709
like for example you worked on feature

269
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:54,440
ABC you're done you're integrated it

270
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,389
you've integrated into a develop branch

271
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:57,680
and then you want to release it a week

272
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,540
later but at the same time you're going

273
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,589
to start on D and E at that point it's

274
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,449
probably good to get developed merged

275
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:08,839
into release and then not touch it until

276
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,220
it's actually out in production and of

277
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,480
course you can probably guess at this

278
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,070
point that you know master branch it

279
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,860
contains the official release history

280
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,230
anything that is in master branches

281
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,779
production and in case of like you know

282
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,279
when really hits the fence you have

283
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,110
hotfix branches which are pretty much

284
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,870
similar to feature branches but they're

285
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,000
based off the master branch instead of

286
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,470
the develop branch so really get flow

287
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,050
helps maintain the sanity of our

288
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,899
branches for us and from what I went

289
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:42,980
through just now you'll notice that

290
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,079
there's like three branches which are

291
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,750
kind of like gatekeepers so like develop

292
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,640
release and master and it makes kind of

293
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,490
like a common sense decision in terms of

294
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,360
code review that we do it there so

295
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,089
anytime you want to put code in to

296
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,459
develop release or master it has to go

297
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,230
through like a pull request and a proper

298
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,079
code review process kind of like the

299
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,000
pseudo one that we did just now so get

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,420
flow helps but for us of oats help as

301
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,589
well we specifically has this have these

302
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:20,690
commit and feature branch only commit

303
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,300
and push often in fact like we we make

304
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,740
it a point that every single logical

305
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,139
improvement to the code is committed and

306
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:30,769
pushed we also merge develop into

307
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:32,690
feature branches every day just because

308
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,579
somebody else would be working on other

309
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,319
features and they may have merged alien

310
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:39,860
to develop and merge features only in

311
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,680
the developed never

312
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,720
ever ever do master only have pull

313
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,110
requests to master and as long as we use

314
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,839
get flow and stick to our odds we are

315
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,480
really able to work on really as many

316
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,060
features that we want at least at this

317
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,149
point but obviously just having

318
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:59,790
branching is really not enough we still

319
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,820
have if just just by having branches we

320
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,870
still have to bring our laptops

321
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,700
everywhere we need to get we actually

322
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,350
now need to get them deployed and to

323
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,570
that I want to talk a little bit about

324
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,110
our environments of which we have four

325
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,790
and again you'll see how like get flow

326
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,060
is really the starting point for our

327
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,589
environments as well the first one is

328
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:21,060
local I mean this is really

329
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,950
straightforward it's the developers

330
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,580
laptop yeah done we jump to the third

331
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,800
one I'll get back to the second but this

332
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,130
is basically this hosts the staging

333
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,200
arrahman hosts basically the developed

334
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,120
branch or the release branch and the

335
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,620
reason why it could be both is because

336
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,570
we may not have a release branch all the

337
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,120
time if we do then it serves the release

338
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,709
branch otherwise it always serves the

339
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:46,890
develop branch and obviously we have the

340
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,709
production environment which you run

341
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,600
which runs everything that's in the

342
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,920
master branch everything that's in

343
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,350
master branch goes into production and

344
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,240
you think actually that this is probably

345
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,320
the most important branch but to us the

346
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,150
development branch is actually the most

347
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,059
important it's where the features are

348
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,160
deploy it's where the real stuff happens

349
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,510
and we and we invest in that so

350
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,860
basically when you deploy something to a

351
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,569
develop branch it automatically goes to

352
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,540
alpha no red mercom if you deploy

353
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,949
something to a feature branch it

354
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,589
automatically goes to a feature URL

355
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,660
something like this which would which is

356
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,550
what we saw just now when I did a push I

357
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,870
was deployed although I cheated but it's

358
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,809
still deployed at GS conf alpha to read

359
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:38,820
more calm so anybody can go in and

360
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,330
access it and provide feedback and the

361
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,730
commander deploy basically is is the

362
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,140
ever so loved git push right it just

363
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,520
figures out like depending on which

364
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,860
branch you deploy to which branch you

365
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,810
push it

366
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,570
it gets deployed by CI automatically so

367
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,770
you really don't have to worry about

368
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,420
anything else but just working about

369
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,960
your code and working in Game four the

370
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,700
CI process basically I mean we use

371
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,060
Travis you could use Jenkins circle CIO

372
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,450
whatever but basically the point is this

373
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,660
that once you do a push the CI process

374
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,060
Travis picks up the branch and because

375
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,950
it knows it obviously knows what branch

376
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,380
you push too so by translation in those

377
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,510
which environment and by that it knows

378
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,090
exactly which service to deploy to as

379
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,450
well so it runs the test it builds it

380
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,810
creates the artifacts by me but by that

381
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,210
i mean like it compresses minify zip set

382
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,090
up and then actually transfers them to

383
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,130
the right server and starts the

384
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,430
application we use grunt for this so

385
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,460
every one of our application has a CI

386
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,020
directory which has a particular grunt

387
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,060
file that is responsible for like

388
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,220
compressing zipping and transferring all

389
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,260
the artifacts to the correct server and

390
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,480
in case you prefer to look at flow shots

391
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,780
but basically it's pretty much the same

392
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,520
developer pushes within Travis you do a

393
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,650
build if it fills it we notify people

394
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,440
and slack if it passes you create

395
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,770
artifacts you zip them up compress them

396
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,080
we also upload them to s3 in case of

397
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,420
roll backs and then we get the

398
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,280
particular service transfer the

399
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,400
artifacts to dr. buss and then start the

400
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,290
application on those service and all

401
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:30,710
this part is done by grunt task and that

402
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,750
just means like they don't the powerful

403
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,040
thing about that is we just get to

404
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,530
deploy with git commands I mean it

405
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,180
doesn't it doesn't mess with the

406
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,890
developer workflow because that's you're

407
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,660
so familiar with get I mean we love get

408
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,200
and the cool thing also is now that

409
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,060
communication also becomes part of this

410
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,890
workflow so we never ever changed the

411
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,840
developer workflow that is the central

412
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,300
part of everything so every time we

413
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,890
create a new feature we have a new

414
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,260
channel and snack and the slack and who

415
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,030
all the bills for those features are

416
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,980
automatically populated to their channel

417
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,029
so that you know every time a commit

418
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:07,359
is is is pushed it's automatically

419
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:09,729
deployed just like in the case with the

420
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:13,450
GS con for example so we know we really

421
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,159
no longer have to bring our laptops to

422
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:17,769
show anything and any and anybody who

423
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:19,450
wants to get involved or wants to keep

424
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,399
updated just just need to follow that

425
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:27,190
channel yeah and basically what that

426
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,379
means is like we we are now able to

427
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:34,929
communicate every incremental change and

428
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,190
we communicate it in the best way

429
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,009
possible which is just the right code

430
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:41,229
and obviously I mean not showing code to

431
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:43,599
whoever wants to be who wants to be

432
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,849
notified but giving them something that

433
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:49,029
is that works and they can play around

434
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,609
and interact with let every single

435
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:55,749
comment another as a result of that we

436
00:20:55,749 --> 00:21:00,279
really do have a lot less meetings when

437
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,749
we spend the time instead playing more

438
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:05,499
foosball Tim turns out like this was a

439
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,599
probably the biggest realization for me

440
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,960
is that everybody hates meetings I

441
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,580
thought actually it was just the

442
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,229
developers that hate them and everybody

443
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,320
else just uses me things to kind of like

444
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,009
do do stuff but turns out it's not the

445
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:24,639
case so back to my lightning slide

446
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:27,519
because I love it so much what exactly

447
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,269
is lightning branches so actually it's

448
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:34,149
really nothing but what we think of as a

449
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:36,519
considered investment in the development

450
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:39,999
environment every logical improvement

451
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,159
every single commit is important not

452
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,779
just the final deployment that you go

453
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:45,849
into staging or to production every

454
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:47,259
single one of those commits that is

455
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:49,749
important and it's important to get

456
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:52,809
feedback on that and get it quickly so

457
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,299
to be able to deploy every single one of

458
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:58,599
them in separate feature branches is

459
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,080
really awesome and it also inculcates

460
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,349
the habit of really pushing small and

461
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:07,299
increment incremental changes very fast

462
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:13,119
and getting feedback so in case like

463
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,559
I've been putting you guys to sleep or

464
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,900
anything if you wanted to listen

465
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,630
to just this part this is pretty much

466
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,220
the crux of it like how do we actually

467
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,930
deploy the feature branches which i

468
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:28,330
think is simple but pretty neat and the

469
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,020
answer is like we use nginx I mean it's

470
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,840
really good at routing so why not and

471
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,970
our single page applications are really

472
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,070
good at being lightweight and just about

473
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,410
being able to run anywhere like you put

474
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,810
it on s3 you put it you know anyway it

475
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,260
just runs so all you really need is this

476
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,620
like a server block in internet set a

477
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,530
white list of you know a domain set a

478
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,930
default feature we usually use develop

479
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,810
make sense and then based on the host

480
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,720
you change the feature so if which is

481
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,850
just a simple reg reg ex and says that

482
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,850
if it's jas confidence that if it's GS

483
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,070
condo Alfred or in macomb then the

484
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,110
feature is GS conf and we will serve

485
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,930
that at a path of path to features last

486
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,080
year's conf and then it's really really

487
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,810
simple it's just a simple matter of you

488
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,520
know transferring your bill artifacts to

489
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,020
the correct path to the correct server

490
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,540
and it just works like we don't have to

491
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,950
create a new server you just need to

492
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,720
deploy to the correct place with this

493
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,010
really neat configuration and you guys

494
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,600
might be thinking like what really

495
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,140
that's it it's that simple yeah it's

496
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,080
kind of that simple I mean actually

497
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,690
there's a lot more we do use a lot of

498
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,730
Chef a lot of Ruby to do a lot of the

499
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,860
automation but I kind of like a value my

500
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,360
life I don't want to talk about it here

501
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,380
in gs conf but in case there's any one

502
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,060
of you who want to talk about it and are

503
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,370
not loaded with a gun or something come

504
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:03,290
and share with me yeah thank you thank

505
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,639
you refinish

506
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:08,489
maybe just one question for a déjà

507
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,019
especially for those of you who are

508
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,779
involved in large-scale applications and

509
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,159
need to build features all right all

510
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:25,919
right yes one Steve hi yep I'm just a

511
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,419
question how many times your push to

512
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:30,149
production every day I mean obviously

513
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:32,399
this is not i think is more devops top

514
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:35,879
but yeah just wondering it depends on

515
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:38,519
which project but for the front end i

516
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,009
would say at least once or twice once or

517
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:43,859
twice because i feel for get for get

518
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,979
floor i might not be yes I mean it's

519
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:48,149
actually quite complicated and the

520
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,979
teacher or your developers on direct

521
00:24:49,979 --> 00:24:51,959
might be something that is more suited

522
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,209
is I think most of our long releases so

523
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:56,549
it's actually quite as puzzle when you

524
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:59,309
say you'll use it for my pusher

525
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:01,349
production like quite fast no i mean we

526
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:03,659
actually use it like for the simple CSS

527
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,299
hack yeah that I did we do that all the

528
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,009
time because feature branches are like

529
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,019
super super cheap have your consider

530
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:11,969
like maybe like github flow way all you

531
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,039
just do is from master to feature branch

532
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:17,129
and then back to master so that

533
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:18,179
simplifies you don't even have the

534
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,759
release and you know stuff like that we

535
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,799
wanted to do this so that we can have

536
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,329
the ability to have pull requests you

537
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,369
also can have pork rest you know just to

538
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:32,070
master I mean in a sense yeah I mean

539
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,829
just a taller because I mean looking at

540
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:36,929
this thing for over a year now it's okay

541
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:40,619
cool yeah it's chatter yeah yeah their

542
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:42,209
various ways of doing it I think Jews

543
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,849
what suits for your team get a floor get
