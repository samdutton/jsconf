1
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,000

and then I'm going to talking about

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,780
html5 JavaScript api's and and this this

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,610
the kind of picture I think of the

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,190
Sharks me or html5 and the freaking

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,990
lasers on the top of the AP is that the

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,029
JavaScript API is in there because the

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,920
eight the html5 spec is absolutely

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,289
massive but there's a huge focus on the

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,900
language that's in html5 and that's just

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,269
like a tiny bit of the iceberg the the

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,610
really chunky bit of the spec is the

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,180
JavaScript API so so I'm going to kind

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,230
of show you some of those i'm gonna show

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,760
you some of the code that's in the

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,160
JavaScript api's and show you how they

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,920
can they can be used before I jump in

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,989
and I wanted to mention 2022 because I

18
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,520
kind of that's the date that rings with

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,270
html5 as well and and it came out of an

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,500
interview with aaron hexen who's the

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,370
editor html5 with techrepublic and 20 22

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,059
is the date that two browsers have a

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,489
completely interoperable implementation

24
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,430
of html5 so to put that in some kind of

25
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,479
context and CSS 2.1 only has one

26
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,689
complete implementation in ie8 but i'm

27
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,390
still using CSS 2.1 and i'm pretty sure

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,770
if any of you guys doing any web stuff

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,740
you're using CSS so that's not going to

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,009
stop me from using html5 in my apps

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,659
today so html5 is that this large

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,159
collection this is just some of the the

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,900
JavaScript API eyes on there so let's

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,250
drag and drop there's the history API

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,890
and so on and but what I want to talk to

36
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,340
you about is html5 which the only

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,229
difference being is that there's stuff

38
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,939
that was ripped out the html5 spec and

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,880
put into sep respects so I'm going to

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,610
touch on web forms and you should be at

41
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,570
a CEO cyber web forms the media elements

42
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,420
canvas and offline applications and this

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,369
stuff isn't in the html5 spec they were

44
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,840
pulled out and are now in their own

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,369
separate specs but they're they're

46
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,590
pretty cool and interesting api's i

47
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,360
think i want to show you how it all

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,670
works so web forms works in in opera and

49
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,530
some Safari and I'm kind of starting

50
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,599
with one that makes us not have to do as

51
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,410
much work and that's a flickr search for

52
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,630
web forms that matches on storm trooper

53
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,440
not sure why so JavaScript originally

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,060
liked it back in the day it was good for

55
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,180
a form validation and image rollovers

56
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,520
that's kind of where we've all come from

57
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,180
and image rollovers was sold with this

58
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,519
hover Syria class and now we have web

59
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,940
forms to handle form validation so Java

60
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,970
scripts only good for awesome now

61
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,650
so and what this is is just this is

62
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,450
straight markup on the page where I've

63
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,269
put and a form on the page nothing

64
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,280
special on initially no JavaScript and

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,519
the input type up here has type is is

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,890
email and in Opera because it has all

67
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,739
the web from to go stuff it will

68
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,500
immediately validate my my email address

69
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,390
for me so donkey doesn't validate as a

70
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,910
rly man address but when I submit the

71
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,830
the form I've got this this tiny piece

72
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,420
of JavaScript where I can actually hook

73
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,440
in and say is the form valid the point

74
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,370
being and is that it's less donkey work

75
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,690
for us guys to do we don't have to write

76
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,709
the JavaScript that does the form

77
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,570
validation every single time I mean

78
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,650
there's libraries out there to do this

79
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,540
stuff for us but if we don't have to

80
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,880
keep adding this stuff that's really you

81
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,100
know is it's like Dom scripting Dom

82
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,209
scripting been solved cross-browser

83
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,180
problems have been solved with you know

84
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,310
jobs with libraries if we can get rid of

85
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,170
the the form validation problem it means

86
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,579
that we can start you know writing more

87
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,810
interesting JavaScript and not have to

88
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,000
handle those problems my my kind of

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,269
dream for the moment is these libraries

90
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,239
detect web forms support and if it's not

91
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,160
there they kick in and kind of add the

92
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,019
web form support but I know there's kind

93
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,370
of discussion as there whether or not

94
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,799
the specs awry and so on but that's my

95
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,549
dream and I i mentioned Safari has web

96
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,639
forms to go support as well so you can

97
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,069
the way that they they're making use of

98
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,579
it is in their kind of assistive device

99
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:15,190
so on your iPhone these are the

100
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,810
keyboards that come up for the different

101
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,150
input types and you can see on input

102
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,560
type is tell you get different you get

103
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
the the numerical

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,130
add so i believe moderniser is looking

105
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,140
for the is checking the input types and

106
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,820
telling you whether or not these these m

107
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,260
/ types are available and it's is

108
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,390
putting up a false negative positive in

109
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,600
WebKit because the desktop browser

110
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,520
thinks that it can it can handle the

111
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,320
telephone input type is actually the

112
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,470
mobile phone version what's that no no i

113
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,790
know i know it'swork it's for it should

114
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,620
be it the desktop should should say not

115
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,480
like don't support this but you know

116
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,830
maybe they're going to assistive device

117
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,200
attached to the the computer that you

118
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,010
know is looking for this kind of thing

119
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,720
so again it is the browser spool so I'm

120
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,450
moving on to a meteor elements and thats

121
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,560
basically audio and video and they

122
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,630
basics they both extend out of them this

123
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,970
this media element i'm going to focus on

124
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,760
a video for for this this section so

125
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,420
this is embedding a video into page now

126
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,670
which is compressed down to this one

127
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,050
line with the media relevant and there

128
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,420
is kind of the problem of Betamax versus

129
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,450
VHS the codec wars and originally the

130
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,060
spec had discussions about telling the

131
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,560
browsers which code excited to implement

132
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,580
and that will went out the window

133
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,130
because they can't the for instance

134
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,960
Firefox has open source I can't

135
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,890
implement a patented or a close source

136
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,360
codec so that's now how to buy the

137
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,030
browsers so we now have to input types

138
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,450
and you've got a kind of wonder about

139
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,380
the guys who don't support the video

140
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,850
element a fire opera 9.6 did support

141
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,890
video but it doesn't anymore and it

142
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,040
supposed to soon and but I doesn't

143
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,830
support video just yet and deon mention

144
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,620
the release dates 15 years away so it's

145
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,110
a while before I II will so we need to

146
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,080
take our nice full line job and turn

147
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,550
into this to look for QuickTime and then

148
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,090
to look for the flash object so you need

149
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,250
you can drop down the support to defer

150
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,350
back onto the nasty massive flash thing

151
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,080
but we're going to look at this and the

152
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,930
API is attached to the video element so

153
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,720
this is a quick hack I put together the

154
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,960
other night my cat dizzy being dizzy and

155
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,330
down a bomber this is there is my my

156
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,390
control so I've got a button

157
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,640
stop-start and this this timer which

158
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,070
could be a a progress bar but it's it

159
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,800
the code is really simple it's when I

160
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,310
click on the pause button I check if the

161
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,220
video is paused in the first place and I

162
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,230
check the property video ended and if it

163
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,760
has ended I've set the time back to the

164
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,520
beginning and if they've clips on I just

165
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,680
play the video otherwise I'd pause the

166
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,290
video I realized about ten minutes ago

167
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,000
that this code is a little bit wrong the

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,380
orders wrong but you guys aren't going

169
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,720
to work that just until you play with it

170
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,380
so um the videos also have or the audit

171
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,850
in the media elements also have events

172
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,040
attached to them and the the in

173
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,810
particular the time update event which

174
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,730
progresses as the the video goes long so

175
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,640
you can hook into these events and I in

176
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,920
my demo I'm just setting the the current

177
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,540
time I'm just formatting as a time and

178
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,910
updating the the progress slider

179
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,720
basically so the API is is really simple

180
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,190
for video and audio you could play pause

181
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,190
and you've got these events can play

182
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,560
tells you the the actual element is

183
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,990
ready to be used and you can hook into

184
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,800
the end of the vent and I kind of see

185
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,120
you could create really interactive kind

186
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,250
of video on the side and in fact you can

187
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,960
have these videos and you can have the

188
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,520
points of which it slides change have a

189
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,500
JSON file that's attached latin and make

190
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,040
them progress action the browser and in

191
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,080
in testing browsers tend to be rather

192
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,770
quiet about bugs in with video so

193
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,090
firefox if you don't give it the right

194
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,470
content type it just doesn't do anything

195
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,060
it doesn't throw an error it just just

196
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,350
doesn't do anything you get black screen

197
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,530
and Safari if you tell it it's a text

198
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,900
HTML page and if you get a content type

199
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,270
of text HTML then it will just plow on

200
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,100
and just try and read the media and and

201
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,720
just play it in the in the browser

202
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,650
accessibility is a big question and

203
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,090
there's a lot of kind of discussions

204
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,200
going on in America at moment about

205
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,000
accessibility but this is a video I

206
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,490
found which is using the progress event

207
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,190
at the the time update and it's got this

208
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,010
JSON file with the subtitles to the

209
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,390
video and it's but they basically create

210
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,100
captioning which i think is really

211
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,090
interesting because this could be then

212
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,930
fed out to a Braille

213
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,260
assistive device so there's a I think

214
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,339
there's a lot of opportunity inside

215
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,970
about so the campus is kind of the the

216
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,190
other really sexy part of html5 and

217
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,350
which works in these browsers and with a

218
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,320
bit kicking from xjs will work for in IE

219
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,079
as well so you've seen some of these

220
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,170
demos and eons talk as well and the you

221
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,510
know it look good for games and bacon

222
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,690
basically i'm going to show you how to

223
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,300
do this code this in in canvas and it's

224
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,730
just a simple gradient so my day my

225
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,410
markup I've just got this canvas element

226
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,100
and I get the 2d context of the canvas

227
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,740
there's 3d stuff that's kind of being

228
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,720
worked on and separate but at the moment

229
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,199
the canvas just TD and I'm crank this

230
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:32,579
this gradient object within the top left

231
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,639
and the the radius of the first circle

232
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,000
and the outer radius is top left as well

233
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,040
adding color stops and setting the

234
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,279
gradient to my my canvas and then

235
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,019
filling that that that canvas itself and

236
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,870
it gives me this this most gradient

237
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,610
really really sexy which I couldn't do

238
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,319
you know five at Photoshop in two

239
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,720
minutes but there's some there's other

240
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,010
really nice features inside of the

241
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,680
canvas like things like you can do to

242
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,810
data URL so you can actually get all the

243
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,510
raw data out of the canvas and save that

244
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,490
as an image so you could add you fight

245
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,769
your photoshop app and you could

246
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,420
literally just save it to your desktop

247
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,339
using this this to data and and and then

248
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,930
you've got the canvas plus drawimage

249
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,870
plus video equals Frankenstein in some

250
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,510
kind of massive mashup but it's a recall

251
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,500
Frankenstein because you get to do

252
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,899
things like this again I knew I knew

253
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,010
dealing was going to have these slides

254
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,899
in here so I haven't just stolen them

255
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,670
from this previous one but what's going

256
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,550
on here is this is the the explanation

257
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,740
from their blog post what they've got is

258
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,180
that the thing that's playing is

259
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,279
actually a canvas element and there's a

260
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,500
timer reading of a hidden video and

261
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,269
grabbing that image and putting into the

262
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:44,160
canvas and then when you click on one of

263
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,170
these patterns it takes that and maps

264
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,350
onto the the campus as well but they're

265
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,750
really really interesting bit is this

266
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,720
canvas

267
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,720
and get image data so they're getting

268
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,060
this this this data back from the canvas

269
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,740
at that point in time that particular

270
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,560
frame and then they're going through

271
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,560
each one of the pixels and looking for

272
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,779
the white spots and at that when they

273
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:09,009
find that white spot they've got the

274
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:11,680
coordinate to map that extra canvas over

275
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,209
the top of it which is how it's working

276
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:14,769
so there's two ways of doing it there

277
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:17,500
the code and that demo is a looping on

278
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,420
like a full step so it's taking every

279
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,370
fourth pixel checking what the value is

280
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,170
and then and working out what the

281
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,629
position of the the late on pattern is

282
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:27,759
you can also have a kind of really small

283
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,620
canvas hidden away the side and go

284
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,740
through every one of those pixels so

285
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,209
this is a the same video that I had

286
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,519
before and I've create the canvas

287
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,040
element next to it I translate it the

288
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,720
campus so it's kind of flipped it

289
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,240
vertically and then I'm drawing the

290
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,790
video on on progress and it's creating

291
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,430
this mirror effect next to it and which

292
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,250
you know pointless for a cat but you

293
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,439
know you could you can see how Safari

294
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:56,040
has those you know inversed mirrors

295
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,809
shadow you know the mirror effects

296
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:00,490
underneath their videos and there's

297
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,319
there's a lot of stuff that you could do

298
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:05,110
with the video in canvas you could use

299
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,220
it for a lot of evil as well I can

300
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,350
imagine the you know the flash nasty ads

301
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,329
that you get from the ad agency so if

302
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,040
anyone can promise not to sell the ad

303
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,579
agencies I think we're going to be good

304
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:21,850
and how am i doing for time anyone ok ok

305
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,860
screw up monkey bang oh cool cool ok so

306
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,439
offline applications is in safari and

307
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:32,529
firefox 3.5 except there's a huge

308
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,300
bargain firefox 3.5 so does actually

309
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,540
work they fixed it as far as I've seen

310
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,670
and it's in the beta but it hasn't made

311
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,290
it into the the actual release version

312
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,059
so I'm just going to show you it offline

313
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:46,839
applications in Safari what it gives us

314
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,720
is this application cache so kind of in

315
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,959
a way when I e4 had offline mode we've

316
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,720
now got it today no 6 years 7 years 8

317
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,420
years later and but it just creates an

318
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,370
offline mode basically you've got events

319
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,290
like offline and online that will

320
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,519
trigger when you pull out the connection

321
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,720
where you go down to

322
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,879
you know no reception and you have this

323
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,060
navigated offline property which in my

324
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,459
tests doesn't prove anything you can be

325
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,779
completely disconnected for the internet

326
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:17,230
and online or so true so I recommend not

327
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,480
relying on those just yet but the

328
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,910
offline online prob events do fire when

329
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,480
you kind of disconnect and so on so this

330
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,220
is a this is demo hack together of a

331
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,009
Rubik's Cube on my iPhone so if anyone

332
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,779
if you have an iPhone and you try and

333
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,069
navigate to a page when you don't have

334
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:35,319
any reception you don't get the page

335
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:37,209
tool nothing loads up you get the white

336
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:38,949
screen you're like crap i just wanted to

337
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,360
look at that piece of text think about

338
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,980
this the screenshot is that it's in

339
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,319
airplane mode so i can navigate that URL

340
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,540
and it will load it up because I've got

341
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,670
the offline applications enabled on this

342
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,899
web page so this looks like this you add

343
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,540
the the manifest attribute to your your

344
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,600
markup you point it to a file and inside

345
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,819
of that file you have this this line at

346
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,399
the top says cache manifest you include

347
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,089
the files that you want to to have as a

348
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,360
marked as offline available offline the

349
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,769
other thing is the file that's including

350
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,470
this manifest also gets included so you

351
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,809
know my apt I HTML has been included in

352
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:18,399
the manifest I've included the version

353
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,300
number at the bottom which I'll come on

354
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,360
to a second so the first line needs to

355
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,699
be manifest and you have to serve as

356
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:28,110
cash and manifest the version number

357
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,569
what that's for is if you if you touch

358
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,100
the phone so he changed the time stamp

359
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,649
on the file the browser won't go and get

360
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,629
it again it's only if you change the

361
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:40,449
contents of the file like the offline

362
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:42,129
assets can be updated you can delete

363
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:44,860
them and your your your web page will

364
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,180
still work and it'll still think they're

365
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,000
there and by changing it by being a

366
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,680
version number in there the contents of

367
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,629
the manifest spot changes the browser

368
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:54,639
then picks that up andrew lowes your

369
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,029
cash and there's also the application

370
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:00,550
cache which is like the api to kind of

371
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,459
get updates from that you can't you

372
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,600
can't clear out the cash through this

373
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,350
this api it does it when you call the

374
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,089
update it doesn't actually go off and

375
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:11,470
refresh the cache or anything like that

376
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,259
just it tells it notifies you there is

377
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:14,499
an

378
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,089
date you could force a reload of the

379
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,039
page but haven't quite worked out how

380
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,979
and still how to really reload the

381
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:23,469
counter properly I strongly strongly

382
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:25,869
strongly recommend if you use offline

383
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:28,719
apps add at last finish your application

384
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,529
then add the manifest afterwards because

385
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,759
because of this version versioning and

386
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,109
I'll show you the process that happens

387
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:37,479
behind the scenes you can get a real

388
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:41,289
mess as to what state your cash is in so

389
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:44,619
the process is and are you going to see

390
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:47,619
the background it sucks okay the browser

391
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:50,199
and makes the request it goes off to the

392
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,729
server and the server serves up all the

393
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:53,859
contents for that web page to the image

394
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:56,829
and so on the browser says ah i see a

395
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:59,379
manifest file so it tells the server i

396
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:01,119
want all that stuff again so the server

397
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,829
gives back the manifest assets so i

398
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,389
don't know why this like this double hit

399
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:06,639
I don't understand being able to work

400
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,259
out from the spec that it says you need

401
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,789
this double hit but that's what Safari

402
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:12,639
is doing at the moment the browser then

403
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,489
triggers this event say the the cash has

404
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:18,819
now been updated and and when you reload

405
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:21,549
the the browser it'll say I have a

406
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:24,970
manifest for this this this domain this

407
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,579
this your own so just request that

408
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,799
manifest file the server then goes yeah

409
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,389
that hasn't changed so I'm senior three

410
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,279
or four and the browser serves

411
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,720
everything locally so that's what's

412
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,609
happening on my iPhone when I visit that

413
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:38,769
offline version of that that Rubik's

414
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,049
Cube so it's accessing everything

415
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:46,629
locally so storage is the the first one

416
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:48,519
it was recently ripped out of the year

417
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,279
the html5 spec and yet it's basically

418
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,839
giant cookies because you know cookies

419
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:55,929
are for K storage is a lot bigger and as

420
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:56,919
far as I can tell there's no

421
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,399
documentation on how big well how big

422
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,329
the key value pair storage can be and so

423
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,250
key value pair is literally just like

424
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,720
cookies you set the key and you've got

425
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,869
value works in most of the browser's

426
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:13,480
SQLite only works in safari and again as

427
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,159
Deion's said there's kind of discussions

428
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,659
of asked whether SQR likes the right

429
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:19,299
thing storage is really really simple

430
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:22,119
you have these two objects once for once

431
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,980
called session storage which is the

432
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,400
window basis that you know that

433
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,690
bap tickle session so if you have been

434
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,890
in your window it doesn't apply anymore

435
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,930
and you've got local storage which is

436
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,750
attached to the domain and you just have

437
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,760
set item and get item and it just

438
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,750
retrieves them and set them and so on

439
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,320
the set item you can only set strings so

440
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,600
if you you can't pass in an object or

441
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,590
anything like that anything more

442
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,080
complicated but you could convert it to

443
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,940
Jason stick it in there or you know

444
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,350
Jason just get out and convert it back

445
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,590
out again so this is what it looks like

446
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,870
in safaris debugger again I don't know

447
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,880
if there's there may be a Firebug plugin

448
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,830
for firefox to actually inspect this

449
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,610
kind of stuff but I haven't seen ya

450
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,960
there's it's also quite difficult to

451
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,390
debug and get rid you've got you've got

452
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,220
this field here but in Firefox that I

453
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,540
can't see any way of getting rid of that

454
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,000
kind of stuff you can delete the offline

455
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,530
cash through the properties we can't

456
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,300
clear out this kind of stuff but you can

457
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,890
you can do the recession a storage door

458
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,640
clear and it will get rid of it for you

459
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,750
sorry I should go back that timestamp

460
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,880
field that's not a property that comes

461
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,530
with it this is just the time so I feel

462
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,510
that I added from this test page so the

463
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,750
spec for html5 recently changed with

464
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,540
regard to sqlite and whereas before they

465
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,110
were trying to create yet spec out a

466
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,030
SQLite they've just changed it and

467
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,400
pulled out the whole thing and said the

468
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,760
user agent should implement whatever

469
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,500
13.1 three point six point one and nine

470
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:57,560
whatever they is an SQLite SQL also when

471
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,090
it fails it'll pretty quietly as well if

472
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,530
it screws up there's something really

473
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,110
wrong there's error handlers see you can

474
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,520
post in kind of success handlers and

475
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,950
error handlers but when it screws up

476
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,200
like it just doesn't doesn't really tell

477
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,940
you about it so it's pretty hard to

478
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,650
debug when when you're messing around

479
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,350
with it this is what the syntax looks

480
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,620
like so you open your database um you

481
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,180
tell it what database you want to create

482
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,710
you give it version number so you can

483
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,590
actually increment your version numbers

484
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,810
this is the default table and you give

485
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,400
it a size that you want to play around

486
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,120
with

487
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,150
and I I suspect there's not a limit to

488
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,410
how big you can make your database I

489
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,440
think it's to make or something and this

490
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,720
is how it works so you you call this the

491
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,970
transaction and you get a call back with

492
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,470
the transaction object you run your SQL

493
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,240
against it it's all kind of cool back

494
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,800
base so you run your SQL and once that's

495
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,360
finished you were you get a call back

496
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,580
with the the result the escrow is pretty

497
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,000
pretty easy to run and and you can also

498
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,980
you've got a command line in Safari as

499
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,360
well that you can just you know type

500
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,860
your SQL and run it and see the result

501
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,420
and you can you can dip into the

502
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,890
database and the tables and look at the

503
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,870
fields and so on and yeah it's it's it's

504
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,700
pretty straightforward but again because

505
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,790
it's just text I don't see a particular

506
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,440
particularly big advantage over just

507
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,690
using key value pair unless you're doing

508
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,370
something much more complicated in terms

509
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:22,490
of kind of rational requests so

510
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,770
geolocation is also one of those cool

511
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,270
api's which you know everyone's kind of

512
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,300
going geo mad and and it works in

513
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,670
firefox out of the box and it kind of

514
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,950
works in the iphone the iphone has it

515
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,320
baked into as well this one looks like

516
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,570
on the iphone it prompts you to ask you

517
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,030
where whether or not you want to share

518
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,240
your location when my gps javascript is

519
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,160
trying to grab the location the same of

520
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,600
firefox there's like a bar across the

521
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,740
top that says do you want to share your

522
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,970
location do you always want to share

523
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,550
your location and so on and it doesn't

524
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,410
always work I was sat on the south coast

525
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,630
of England and it said I was in the

526
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,360
middle of London so the the important

527
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,530
thing about this is make sure you've got

528
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,030
some kind of fullback don't rely

529
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,370
entirely on geolocation as bait into the

530
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,590
browser make sure that i would suggest

531
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,690
kind of using it to try and sniff where

532
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,390
they are and then let them specifically

533
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,250
point where they are or say no i'm not

534
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,580
there that's that's complete rubbish the

535
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,650
api looks like this which again i

536
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,540
believe it's from straight out of kind

537
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,820
of the gears spec which damn can nod or

538
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,380
shake yeah yeah yes sort of so you do is

539
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,850
hanging off the navigator object

540
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,800
geolocation get current position of

541
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,140
success handler error handler and the

542
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,179
object that comes back has this chords

543
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:36,980
prop c which has the latitude longitude

544
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,650
and there's also the

545
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,270
accuracy which i think is the thing i

546
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,590
was ignoring when it said i was in the

547
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,880
middle of London so it tells you how

548
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,980
high or close you are to that about that

549
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,050
particular point and obviously on the

550
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,480
iPhone we're hitting me down exactly to

551
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,210
where I was sat it works very well

552
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,190
finally web workers and yeah again as

553
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,040
Dean said it's a threading for a

554
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,380
JavaScript and it can be native or via

555
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,220
gears and there was a hint of trying to

556
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,750
write like a hack version using set

557
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,910
timeouts I had a play myself and I got

558
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,390
so as far as completely breaking ie

559
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,450
because just hung but I can envisage

560
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,340
kind of hacks coming up that simulate

561
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,370
workers to let you try and still use the

562
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,330
the syntax the web work is a completely

563
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,800
sandbox environment so don't have access

564
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,300
to the window object or the document

565
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,400
object or any of the Dom it's got access

566
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,570
to things like the the xhr and the web

567
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:43,080
databases as well and you communicate

568
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,930
between your document and the worker and

569
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,050
back and forth through the messages

570
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,890
debugging I found when I was playing

571
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,800
with it early on I wasn't a hundred sure

572
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,570
how to debug stuff but you just go send

573
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,460
messages out I mean you may kind of

574
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,430
simulate the console log inside your

575
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,320
worker and spit messages out but the

576
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,590
communication is just plain text as well

577
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,510
so this is what a non worker would look

578
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,830
like so what I'm doing is doing that and

579
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,570
i'm looking for a prime number and i'm

580
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,120
running a canvas at the same time and I

581
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,970
got my spinning ball of death and this

582
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,890
is what workers would like when I've

583
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,190
kind of allowed this thread to to run

584
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,100
the number crunching so a few important

585
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,810
things for me is that the reflow is

586
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,960
happening just fine and so the canvas is

587
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,890
able to draw in the screen capture

588
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,030
software may have not caught every

589
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,830
single frame but the canvas is able to

590
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,390
draw I'm still able to select text and

591
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,520
it's able to read you all the numbers as

592
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,740
I'm spitting them back to the the

593
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,300
document inside of the worker you have

594
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,090
import scripts post message on message

595
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,500
and connect i'll show you some of our

596
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,390
syntax

597
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,250
so my main application creates this new

598
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,740
worker object and I give it the the URL

599
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,290
to the script now that needs to be on

600
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,840
the same domain as well and then I

601
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,880
connect the on message and like a hat

602
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,500
set up a handler and an event comes into

603
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,540
this and I've got event data is the

604
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,540
actual message that was sent to me I can

605
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,880
then post messages to my worker and

606
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,670
those are strings as well inside my

607
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,210
worker script and I can import other

608
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,390
libraries and I can have my own message

609
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,460
handler which the syntax is literally on

610
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,930
message I think you can do this to our

611
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,670
message but it's the exact same thing

612
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,740
and it captures the event and if you

613
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,420
want to get the the messages passed into

614
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,520
the worker you need to event or data and

615
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,920
that's the the actual content and then

616
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,900
the the data that sent back out again is

617
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,840
you use it post data sorry post message

618
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,260
and you know whatever text you have is

619
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,760
going to go back out the door you can't

620
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,770
send object is just plain text at the

621
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,350
moment and I remember if the plan is to

622
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,660
have objects that go out but firefox and

623
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,580
safari only support plaintext going in

624
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,960
and out so if you want to trigger a

625
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,550
function the way that I've been doing is

626
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,530
putting a prefix and you know searching

627
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,630
for a carrot and that's the function I

628
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,780
want to call and then I run a piece of

629
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,250
code according to what the worker just

630
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,510
told me to do and as he has a lot more

631
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,910
in html5 so this has just been a summary

632
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,930
I mean there's the sandbox spray iframes

633
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,180
makes a chart to there's progress events

634
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,140
in in the xhr object so you can tell how

635
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,450
how far along your upload or download

636
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,300
has happened the query selector API is

637
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,990
you know basically native CSS selectors

638
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,050
there's this I overlap in in html5 in

639
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,670
the spec as well which i think is really

640
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,550
exciting and drag and drop if anyone

641
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,740
read PP keys I reviewed drag and drop

642
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,850
that so that's definitely worth looking

643
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,470
at because it's a good laugh he

644
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,470
basically destroys the spec and lots of

645
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,650
other things and the documentation was a

646
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,760
little bit hard to find but because

647
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,080
they've now gone into last call it's

648
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,550
going to start syncing over 2 and the

649
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:57,840
w3c documentation to what what WG to org

650
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,880
slash html5 is the complete spec there's

651
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,809
also a kind of pad

652
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,200
version and the what WG complete I've

653
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,659
just created a shortcut this is a

654
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:07,860
version of respect that includes all of

655
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,440
the specs of being ripped out there's a

656
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,179
if you if you're kind of looking for

657
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:13,499
something that suddenly disappeared from

658
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:17,240
the spec if you go to dev w3 org slash

659
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,070
html5 there's a directory of different

660
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,539
kind of things that being ripped out of

661
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,129
other specs there's a nice place to kind

662
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:24,570
of go and have a look for stuff that's

663
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,899
missing and equally the the IRC channel

664
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:30,450
is quite handy if you you're playing

665
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,190
around with brand new code that you have

666
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,749
no idea what isn't working things like

667
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:36,749
the offline and offline manifest I

668
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:38,759
couldn't work out why I couldn't get it

669
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:41,580
to refresh so if you jump on the IRC

670
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,559
channel there's only a few guys on there

671
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,240
but they do come back and ask you a

672
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,470
question I mean leave it a few minutes

673
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,169
and they've but they will go back to you

674
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:50,940
so that's my overview and that's my

675
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,059
geocities version of a closing page and

676
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:56,220
so if anyone has any questions I'll be

677
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,600
happy to take him if I have time

678
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:11,770
otherwise lunch

679
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:23,150
any questions yeah

680
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,870
so html5 is on me it'sit's just so the

681
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,030
question is html5 is currently being

682
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:34,440
proposed CSS 2.1 spec isn't isn't a

683
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,290
final recommendation it is but we will

684
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,910
use it yeah it's pretty well baked into

685
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,410
the browser's the browser's are adding

686
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,180
support pretty quickly and you know

687
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,950
mobile devices are adding support pretty

688
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,370
quickly and the spec has gone to last

689
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,790
call which means that they're not really

690
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,430
making more changes but it's down to the

691
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,800
browser's I mean html5 is is you know

692
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,080
it's a validation it's just validation

693
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,370
and I can use all the technology I don't

694
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,620
have to make it an html5 validated

695
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,480
document I can use content editable or i

696
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,180
can use drag-and-drop it's in the

697
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,380
browser ready and one of the key and key

698
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,630
managers of html5 is there count they're

699
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,850
paving the cow paths so the technology

700
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,400
already I mean a lot of these technology

701
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,170
already exists inside of the browser and

702
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,580
they've spect it out so all the other

703
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,020
browsers can standardize against that

704
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,450
and so a lot of it isn't it content

705
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,230
editable was an example of a you know on

706
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,910
flickr when you click and you can change

707
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,800
the title content editors will give you

708
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,330
that but it's been around for such a

709
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,070
long time that it's actually in all the

710
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,870
browsers and because they've documented

711
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,260
it now that it's it's there and i think

712
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,820
it's got pretty good support in IE which

713
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,880
is you know surprising oh but they came

714
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,570
up with out so you know they should be

715
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:58,279
anyone else cool lunch yeah
