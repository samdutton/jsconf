1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:10,260

ah

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,879
I'm Mike this is Evan and as our wives

3
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:15,470
like to say we are technology life

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,779
partners so if we do everything together

5
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:22,400
but we're here to talk about spackle

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,610
we're members of the spot for 14 and

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,009
it's we're here obviously representing

8
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:30,050
the community there's a lot of work

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,710
that's gone into what about to show you

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,980
most of it is not ours which is cool we

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,260
get to present and them a lot of stuff

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,120
that that we haven't done only just just

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,340
a 12 or one demo stuff that we build so

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,620
yeah so so this is pretty cool so we're

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,969
just going to jump right into sprout

16
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,070
core um so what a sprout course Brock or

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,019
is the way to make blazing fast native

18
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:53,149
style web apps so sort of a buzzword

19
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,850
right now and um how does parkour do

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,129
that we sort of take what the power of

21
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:00,469
the browser eat and also its constraints

22
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:01,850
to try to do the right thing which is

23
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,289
going to be the most fast thing for the

24
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:05,990
web and um like new technology to come

25
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,570
out like html5 and you know we don't

26
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,700
really take a position on the spec when

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,909
we use html5 we sort of mean sort of the

28
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,530
technologies around like the cool

29
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,899
features like the cool video tag video

30
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:21,710
tag audio tags so awesome humbly and

31
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,719
respectfully I'm gonna have to disagree

32
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:28,670
with Pope crockford the first that html5

33
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,060
isn't really from the devil it's not

34
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,469
going to make you go blind it's not

35
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,729
going to put hair on your palms I've

36
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,409
tried it many times so you know we think

37
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,899
that using html5 you know can be

38
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:43,729
difficult can be a kind of the Wild West

39
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,820
but for for sprach room make it a very

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,560
simple and very easy to use there's some

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,530
really cool some really cool stuff okay

42
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,930
so we just went 1 point 0 earlier this

43
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,619
year and we have all these really cool

44
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,020
features but the thing about sprout core

45
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,479
applications is that people don't it's

46
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,350
hard to to know what sprout quarry is

47
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,820
you kind of have to see it for yourself

48
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,030
right so so to show you what a sprout

49
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,310
crap looks like we're going to kind of

50
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,810
give you a quick look at our day job and

51
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,310
we're gonna bring up our boss this is

52
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,690
sewage it gupta he's the

53
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,070
is the vice president development where

54
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,620
we work he's our boss and he's going to

55
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,290
demo this proper up that we've built on

56
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,020
our day job morning's you all right once

57
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,720
your whole damn life all right so while

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,610
they're bringing this up just to give

59
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,590
you a little context so eloquent okle

60
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,080
company we're a market leader and demand

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,730
generation we have over 700 customers

62
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,580
something like over 30,000 users we've

63
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,170
been around for 10 years so when my

64
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,420
Kevin and I joined two years ago we were

65
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,310
given the awesome job of turning that

66
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,020
company and to bring them into the new

67
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,630
you know technology set and we had to

68
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,520
write a user interface that i'm going to

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,950
show you on top of three million lines

70
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,410
of vb code on the back end we do two

71
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,790
billion transactions a day so this is

72
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,740
truly a large-scale application and in

73
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,540
fact it there's a talk I'll you know see

74
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,030
how built that's all so what we want to

75
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,410
do is we wanted to set out and build

76
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,220
something that's gonna be an awesome

77
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,470
experience desktop like you know people

78
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,540
forget that they're running a web app so

79
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,220
let me show you that so when you come

80
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,260
into our app you first come and see this

81
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,630
beautiful dashboard for those of you OS

82
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,310
10 fans and I don't see Tony max here

83
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,310
today but you know you'll see that it's

84
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,660
all too familiar paradigms right you can

85
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,250
add widgets you can remove widgets you

86
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,890
come into what we call our campaign

87
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,340
canvas this is basically where you go in

88
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,060
and create our marketing campaigns and

89
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,520
what a marketing campaign is is that

90
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,380
give you a story that you some of you

91
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,060
will participate in a week and a half

92
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,320
from now we're actually having a

93
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,560
Northern Virginia javascript meetup at

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,090
our office so there'll be beer and pizza

95
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,430
and some more cool demos so we're going

96
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,500
to use our own software to send out the

97
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,940
invitation for that so first we did a

98
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,190
segment in marketing terms where we're

99
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,570
going to take people that attended GS

100
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,430
hunt and then those people that live in

101
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,680
you know Virginia Maryland and DC we're

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,750
going to send you guys an email and then

103
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,400
we're going to if you click on that

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,140
email you get to a landing page and you

105
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,820
submit the fact that you want to show up

106
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,920
and what kind of pizza you want so once

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,750
you've done that then we automatically

108
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,669
send you a reminder and one other thing

109
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:19,709
we're going to do is let's say that you

110
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,140
don't plan to come so we might add

111
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,330
another step that if you do not click on

112
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,070
the email you'll see how interactive

113
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,890
this is you can just come in and connect

114
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,710
this program step to it and now if you

115
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,220
do not

116
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,390
the email maybe we'll send you a

117
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,680
newsletter and I'll use some other way

118
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,000
right so let's take a look at some of

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,670
the real interactivity here so you can

120
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,100
see that as you move this around now if

121
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,110
this is all open source this framework

122
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,900
Evan wrote and one of our colleague

123
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,610
Jonathan has been using this this is

124
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,900
available so if you want to build

125
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,610
something like this you can go get the

126
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,620
open source framework now let me show

127
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,140
you another part here so let's take a

128
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,510
look at the email so this is like

129
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,370
spotlight type search so we're going to

130
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,350
do a GS let's type end up so you get

131
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,920
your familiar search results so I had to

132
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,320
steal some pirate themes nurse so I you

133
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,330
know branded our email with the GS comp

134
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,860
logo and I even got a skull and

135
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,350
crossbones in there but you look at this

136
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,600
app this is kind of like a typical

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,120
desktop iWeb style app so as you move

138
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,160
things around you know it will resize

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,130
you'll see and if the snappy blue lines

140
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,810
are visible here but as you move it

141
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,490
around it shows the centering lines and

142
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,620
so on again open source everything that

143
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,419
we've built that has nothing to do with

144
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,610
Tahlequah I've really pushed the team to

145
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,110
open source that so that it's available

146
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,520
to the community we've taken a lot from

147
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,110
the community and so we want to give

148
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,810
back so let me show you just a couple

149
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,880
more things so you know we have a lot of

150
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
aspects of the system you can go in and

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,510
do set up and you'll see all these

152
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,100
transitions you know they're all desktop

153
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,020
like so we really wanted to essentially

154
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,850
have you forget that you're in a web app

155
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,710
I mean our marketing users they're very

156
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,990
creative people we wanted them to you

157
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,190
know I say to people that there's three

158
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,440
categories of apps there the suck to use

159
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,630
apps there are the easy to use apps what

160
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,710
we're building is what I want to call a

161
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,660
joy to use that where you come back for

162
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,370
more you actually enjoy your experience

163
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,160
so anyway that's my spiel alright thanks

164
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,910
sewage it so that's that's what we do in

165
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,940
our day job we're pretty proud of what

166
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,310
we were of what we built and it's all

167
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,320
due to sprout core so it's pretty cool

168
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,850
stuff but anyway okay so back to spark

169
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,490
or back to sprout poor right so where

170
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,500
are we so you know open source

171
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,640
communities how do you measure success

172
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,260
in open source community so there's a

173
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,289
lot of ways you got logos right how much

174
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,400
money is being invested you also have

175
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,720
libraries how many libraries bed bill

176
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,030
apps are being built on your project how

177
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,830
many Forks do you have on github maybe

178
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,320
and how much money or your company is

179
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,240
offending on oh yeah so one thing that

180
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,640
we think is important in sproul core is

181
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,660
developer engagement you know it's no

182
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,510
secret that a lot of the core team for

183
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,530
Spock word is is that Apple but it's

184
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,120
actually the team the sprout park

185
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,710
community was actually lot bigger than

186
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,590
that so and just to give you a sense of

187
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,260
that so this is the set of features that

188
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,360
we start off with 2010 right right so

189
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,860
this is the core team kind of got

190
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,480
together in the beginning of the year

191
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,770
tried to figure out the 8 things that we

192
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,240
really wanted to complete this time so

193
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,010
now we're here we are in April about a

194
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,510
third of the way through so let's eat

195
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,960
let's see how far away so we go wow yeah

196
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,550
because like that's Paul Shaffer right

197
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,790
there oh wow yeah hi we've gotten those

198
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,710
five things done but you know that's

199
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,760
exciting but that's not the most

200
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,430
exciting thing we also have these 16

201
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,919
other features that were completely

202
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,240
introduced and put into the sprout core

203
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,430
framework by external members of the

204
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,570
community yeah people that weren't an

205
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,580
apple people like people like us just

206
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,470
much guys so there's so all over the

207
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,360
place so we find that very exciting and

208
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,460
you know honestly we could talk about

209
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,990
every one of these features but we

210
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,850
really want to focus only on three right

211
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,220
so we have to boil it down because you

212
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,200
know we have 45 minutes so here we go so

213
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
the first thing we want to talk about is

214
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,910
common j/s so last year I went about

215
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,500
comedy is at this conference and I

216
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,140
thought well this is really cool and

217
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,190
actually a lot of guys in the core team

218
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,770
thought the same thing and so what

219
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,960
school is with sprout core 15 which is

220
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,160
the next version that we're working on

221
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,140
so now we've gone in 10 we're actually

222
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,419
going to be fully common jazz compliant

223
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,190
all our stuff is going to be built with

224
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,300
common J's packages and I'm just modules

225
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,790
excuse me and and the bill tools which

226
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,590
are now Ruby are going to be completely

227
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,870
in JavaScript witches which is pretty

228
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,140
cool but you know as we were doing this

229
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,270
we kind of had a problem because we

230
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,909
wrote all our code before Common j/s

231
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,979
existed and probably a lot of you did as

232
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,620
well and we thought well can we build a

233
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,070
tool that will help us do this with with

234
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,550
the with with with the code that we have

235
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,870
that's not written for common J's and

236
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,400
that helps us solve the problem of

237
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,140
sharing because come and jess is great

238
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,000
for module

239
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,610
but we still can't share our code right

240
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,010
so so there you know the most

241
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,290
communities like Ruby and Python have to

242
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,540
solve this with the gems and eggs and

243
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,070
stuff like I could manage right so

244
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,230
package managers so we looked at all the

245
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,760
package managers and found that they

246
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,650
didn't really help us in the way that we

247
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,900
had with mikes big problem I mean with

248
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,160
the big problem that Mike pointed out

249
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,650
yeah being able to take large amounts of

250
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,090
existing code and make it easy

251
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,610
convertible into common GS so we'd like

252
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,020
to offer the community we've been

253
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,940
working on this thing called CJ s why i

254
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,560
personally has you know as the community

255
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,650
has I've been working on CBS and this is

256
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,570
we're trying to solve that that problem

257
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,400
of making it very easy to take existing

258
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,290
code and put it in there and share it

259
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,680
with everybody right so um this is how

260
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,980
you would install a package of and to be

261
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,170
used in your software so it's one line

262
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,180
command easy this is actually using the

263
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,070
package so it's just you know you just

264
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,200
do some requires and then use the motion

265
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,970
sensor code looks pretty simple pretty

266
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,330
simple um it's built into extend so it

267
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,400
uses get under the covers so when you

268
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,350
fork that you fork a package and it

269
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,180
makes a local version so you can edit it

270
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,560
okay whether you're telling me I don't

271
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,330
have to go dig into some library

272
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,820
directory and copy oh okay it does it

273
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,100
specifically open house built in okay I

274
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,490
like that so I mean you guys may not

275
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,950
like it but i like it i mean so in

276
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,360
packing is when you want to save it onto

277
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,920
a web server this is for like

278
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,750
client-side stuff and it sort of minify

279
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,430
zit and makes the easy to use it's like

280
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,490
build tools built in are so if you want

281
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,140
to push a package that you've done it's

282
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,550
just a single command it goes up there

283
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,110
so all this stuff is pretty simple

284
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,089
pretty easy so I'm going to hopefully do

285
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:39,920
a short little demo of this um yeah we

286
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,240
go to the command line all right you

287
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,970
know what let's blow the font up let's

288
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,320
pull the phone up in here hang on let me

289
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,020
go to you and get you okay so tech oh

290
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,670
can you blow the spawn top yeah I can't

291
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,750
man plus there you go bigger more bigger

292
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,880
I want more you want it yes all right

293
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,889
more okay

294
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:02,329
I technology life partners remember ok

295
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,029
so I get more what it's not even going

296
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:09,589
shift shift command shift hey yeah yes

297
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:11,869
not now you're in the sorry yeah I'm

298
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:15,079
good okay so um very simple this is

299
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:16,970
actually beautify ASI don't know if

300
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,980
everybody seen this it's just a library

301
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,720
jayus library that i found on the i

302
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,209
cloned it brought it down i just made

303
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:25,279
this one directory where i put index.js

304
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,600
which is actually the same code as

305
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,119
beautified ijs this is doing some smart

306
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,619
defaults and the only other file i need

307
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:33,559
to add in here said I mean um down at

308
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,970
the bottom I just I need to add this one

309
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,639
line exports beautify j/s beautifly okay

310
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,679
one line of code one line of code to use

311
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,499
this okay and then in the package Jason

312
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,089
this is like telling it I need just

313
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:45,709
these two things the name of the package

314
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,509
and then the version that we said is

315
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,160
that semantic versioning it's a semantic

316
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,540
right I can't do anything but semantic

317
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,549
versioning yes semantic versioning so I

318
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:54,079
already did have five so we can see that

319
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,399
you can update like this is a case where

320
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,139
you cloned it make a new version

321
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:01,149
excellent save it um and now let's go

322
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:03,079
you guys can you guys read this when you

323
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:09,379
make this bigger okay how's that that's

324
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:10,699
good that a little bit better that looks

325
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:14,169
good alright and now we just do seed

326
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:16,320
push

327
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,230
and it's pushing it up and now it's up

328
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,480
on the CJ s server so that's all I had

329
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,070
to do to actually import this thing and

330
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,510
that server is all written in JavaScript

331
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,800
right it's all written in JavaScript

332
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,650
it's using nodejs on v8 right now but it

333
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,090
can be easily ported to any JavaScript

334
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,180
meant background platform right okay so

335
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,690
let's actually use um this so I also

336
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,100
leave you that I'd you know you're just

337
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,900
tricking me so my music pushed it up

338
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,370
there now let's install it seed install

339
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:50,610
jeaious so one line command installs it

340
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,110
now that's not version that I just put

341
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,550
up there let's go so to use it i just

342
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,650
added a bunch of stuff here so make that

343
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,570
bigger all right sure so we can read

344
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,430
that code because I there we go don't

345
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,910
trust you okay so I just require JSP you

346
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,560
to Phi which the package and there's

347
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,060
another native package called assist to

348
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,410
do some print out things because we're

349
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,460
going to do run it from the command line

350
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,620
because this is going to be server code

351
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,030
just passing some regular JavaScript

352
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,790
that's enough formatted and then we're

353
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,830
going to beautify it and spit it out so

354
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,360
this is all we should be able to should

355
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:30,570
have to do four finger swipe down I know

356
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,980
oh no stinky no sticky fingers hairy

357
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,120
palm hairy palms too much html5 Pope

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,140
croc all right so all right here we go

359
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,880
okay so wow so please purchase it pretty

360
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,680
printed it out server side you can do it

361
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,910
with client side code and it makes it

362
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,990
easier we've already poured it over a

363
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,550
bunch of libraries yep that are up there

364
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,000
so you can even look at that so okay so

365
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,910
now is the part where I get to tell you

366
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,670
that okay we're all in the JavaScript

367
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,400
community here and it would be really

368
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,740
really good if we had a package manager

369
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,500
guys okay we are all still on islands of

370
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,420
code I mean c'mon Janice is part of the

371
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,300
solution but we really do need to sort

372
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,130
of unite around a package manager it

373
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,870
doesn't have to be this one doesn't have

374
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,980
to be this one we're just offering this

375
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,320
up as as a potential solution but we do

376
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,660
need to unite around something so please

377
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,390
go and download it play with it and tell

378
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,130
us if this works for you because you

379
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:29,980
know it

380
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,140
actually make a huge difference for us

381
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,940
as a community of JavaScript errs if we

382
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,520
can just have a JavaScript package

383
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,780
management if you just look at the stats

384
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,960
one like egg and Jim came out like you

385
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,570
see the explosion of the community and

386
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,220
different packages that people use and

387
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,840
different projects to come out so you

388
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,750
know and imp and impassioned play ok so

389
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,500
that was CJ s so it's quick simple and

390
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,080
it uses really it's very easy to use

391
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,700
existing code for it looks really easy

392
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,470
and look pretty good never use elected

393
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,470
I'm gonna try it ok next thing we want

394
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,610
to talk to you about is interface

395
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,490
builder um as for sprout core we sort of

396
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,870
been a little bit late in the game here

397
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,440
um you know you've seen like eh tjs

398
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,840
there's a couple of ones out there and

399
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,270
you know we felt like we didn't want to

400
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,830
start doing it before we were pre 10

401
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,900
because the API was changing and now

402
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,390
with the API static and you know we can

403
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,310
support this API we don't want people

404
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,260
building stuff with the UI to the UI

405
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,240
machine and with the interface builder

406
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,020
and not having a change underneath them

407
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,070
so we also wanted to decide that oh

408
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,680
we're calling it greenhouse yes now it

409
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,180
is greenhouse and this is particularly

410
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,350
the thing that might decide what we've

411
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,580
been working on for the last two months

412
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,710
or so about two months we really like

413
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,730
the logo so let's just look at that logo

414
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,770
enough with the logo okay next slide so

415
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,280
we want to innovate in some small way

416
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,630
you know interface builders haven't

417
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,150
changed a lot in the last 20 years old

418
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,650
in some small way we wanted to try and

419
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,510
push it forward a little bit so the

420
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,430
first thing we wanted to do was sort of

421
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,570
clean up the UI a lot of these you'll

422
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,750
see and like they have all these panels

423
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,340
and it's like well there's your UI in

424
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,150
that little box okay the too small so we

425
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,060
we've blown it out so it's all this is

426
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,500
your whole UI and we've just cleaned it

427
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,870
up and it's just the top bar and the

428
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,860
bottom and that's all you've got and

429
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,880
then the rest of it's just your UI so

430
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,490
and we also have these Pickers that come

431
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,660
up when you need them and you tear them

432
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,460
off and if you want to hover them and

433
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,200
you can dock them to the side if you

434
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,550
want to as well and you can close them

435
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,620
get rid of them when you're done okay so

436
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,330
this is a big one so the other thing we

437
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,440
wanted to do is we want to solve the

438
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,470
blue box problem so for four years this

439
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,360
is what real

440
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,890
face builders look like I don't know if

441
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,970
you guys have a reviews interface

442
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,930
builder but you have blue boxes because

443
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,730
these are all custom views and the guys

444
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,829
that wrote the interface builder didn't

445
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:56,290
know about these custom views so you

446
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,910
know they don't have pretty pictures for

447
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,440
them and you don't want to write extra

448
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,970
code for them because you've gotten out

449
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,420
of time so so you just got blue boxes

450
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,470
and we think that sucks and so well so

451
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,390
that's what it would look like and so

452
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,160
here's what looks like in greenhouse so

453
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,410
here's a similar you actually about the

454
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,449
same and so you can see we've got all

455
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,620
the custom views in and the way we're

456
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,990
able to do this is the magic of iframes

457
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,669
we actually load your entire application

458
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:24,669
in a suspended mode we like suppress

459
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,250
main and we keep it from running and the

460
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,960
whole thing lows and so we can access

461
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,580
your custom views and render them and

462
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,660
draw them and you don't have to write

463
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,630
any code it's really great all right so

464
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,200
it's going to transition next ok so

465
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,919
finally yeah well what we wanna site we

466
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,590
kind of feel like building you eyes with

467
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,150
an interface builder is an inalienable

468
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,070
right of doing a web application

469
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,590
framework so we are offering this to the

470
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,750
community for free right right now free

471
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,240
it's completely some people want to

472
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,160
charge you money for this but we think

473
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,400
that this should be free so this is free

474
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,760
it's on sprout PortMaster right now you

475
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,370
can play with it today so and now we're

476
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,980
going to i believe show you a demo so

477
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,299
i'm going to attempt to do this all

478
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:19,240
right so so on the third tab so let's

479
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,150
get rid of this and

480
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:31,270
oh we do want chrome but we also want

481
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,780
okay so this is what green house looks

482
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,750
like so I've got a simple little app

483
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,230
then fired up loads loads the app up

484
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,540
give it a second here to to load up and

485
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,970
so now here it is loading your app in

486
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:50,820
suspended mode okay so BAM now we're up

487
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,679
so now we can just open up our page

488
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,300
files and for all of you that have built

489
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,250
sprout perhaps this is backwards

490
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,830
compatible with all existing sprout

491
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,990
four-page files it's the exact same file

492
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,020
so it just works so we can bring up our

493
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,030
main page and so as you can see we've

494
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,929
blown out the design area it's really

495
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,600
clean and empty and this is what I've

496
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,490
just generated a really this is like if

497
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,860
you type SC git or svn it's Brock or app

498
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,630
this is what you get so this is like

499
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,179
what you would see maybe there still is

500
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,510
a blue box problem here I can't tell um

501
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,260
we'll see okay so um here's our so we

502
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,970
can move our label element around we've

503
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,840
got a little inspector that's like we

504
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,309
can pop up right there we can also get

505
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,140
to it from up here and sort of tear it

506
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,660
off and put it over there we can open up

507
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,610
our library pain let's add a button we

508
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,929
already have the propagator open so i'm

509
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,760
going to do that let's change the title

510
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,950
will say hello jayus comp I'm very

511
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,540
limited so I have to speak what I type

512
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,570
all right so let's talk about our layout

513
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,080
control so we can anchor obviously you

514
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,760
know this is a an application framework

515
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,710
so you use absolute positioning and you

516
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,720
can just anchor this to the top center

517
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,520
it so let's say we Center this one here

518
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,400
let's just make this 0

519
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,510
and 0 and this one let's anchor tap top

520
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,120
okay ideas okay perfect let's save that

521
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,990
and then we'll run it let's tear this up

522
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,540
whoops will tear this off so we can

523
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,060
resize it so you can see that whoops it

524
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,680
did in fact set the layout so the button

525
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,040
is centered and the label is anchored to

526
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,020
the top as you can see so yes in fact we

527
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,870
can affect the labels and so this is the

528
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,550
code that it outputs and there's this

529
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,200
big warning that says you can't really

530
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,210
edit this in you can if you think you

531
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,550
know what you're doing but do it at your

532
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,560
own risk so now we're going to do

533
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,570
something a little bit more interesting

534
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,340
have we solved the blue box problem

535
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:04,010
where is the terminal there okay so

536
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,600
we're going to i'm just going to write a

537
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,820
custom view real quick and then we're

538
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,310
going to load it into a greenhouse and

539
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,660
we're going to use it so let's just try

540
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,610
this we're going to generate this view

541
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,610
and now you get to see what it looks

542
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,020
like to write a custom Spronk overview

543
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,790
so the generator ran and now we're going

544
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,340
to find a property called color when it

545
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,190
started with READ&WRITE our render

546
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:33,080
method will read this function

547
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,070
and die install this I think it's got a

548
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,510
call he does not the coloring okay so

549
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,220
now we're gonna say context add style

550
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,070
something right ok background color and

551
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:56,490
we're going to say this get

552
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,690
color property right and lastly we want

553
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,100
this to redraw whenever that color

554
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,050
property changes so we're going to say

555
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:10,690
display a display properties array okay

556
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,670
so there we go simple custom views so

557
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,020
now because we load this thing in an

558
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,510
iframe we actually have to reload the

559
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:23,950
app so I'm going to tell reload so so

560
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,870
while we wait for this to reload wait

561
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,280
for it to reload okay so we have a small

562
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:34,810
bug here and I will fix there we go okay

563
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,820
so here's our page that we were on

564
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,790
before and let's add our custom view to

565
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:47,790
our library so it was called colors duck

566
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,920
color i'm going to set a layout we give

567
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,960
a dull fault lay out so that it's just

568
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,490
not really big and huge winged dragon on

569
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,730
nice okay so now some are just drag this

570
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,260
puppy and then so there's our custom

571
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,550
view rendering no extra code BAM okay so

572
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,560
let's do something a little a little bit

573
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,200
more interesting with this let's do some

574
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,860
findings shall we text field it's at a

575
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,670
controller down here we're going to call

576
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,060
it color controller

577
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,370
and as you would expect to just drag

578
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,769
these lines I'm option dragging so it

579
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:36,299
draws the line for the binding so we're

580
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:37,710
going to bind from that color property

581
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,570
and we're just going to add it to a

582
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,980
property called color on this controller

583
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,299
because this is JavaScript you don't

584
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,519
really have to predefine anything we

585
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,399
just say you know color and that's the

586
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,019
property that will bind that too and

587
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:51,000
then this text feel really the same

588
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,070
thing except for the text field is

589
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,990
called value to that same color property

590
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,259
okay BAM so let's save that and run it

591
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:05,940
with any luck you now have the blue box

592
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,029
problem again okay so there you go

593
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:15,539
that's greenhouse simple and free yes

594
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:23,009
it's free so that's greenhouse so this

595
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,149
like I said we've been working on this

596
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:26,129
so it's out today you can check it out

597
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:28,590
and play with it and it's sort of a

598
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,539
Developer Preview they're still bugs

599
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,000
like you saw and but I'm we're actually

600
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,649
working on yes so been working on for

601
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:37,740
about two months and we've done our day

602
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,049
job that mean that like so after hours

603
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,909
trying to figure it out ah but will we

604
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:43,769
will actually be building apps on this

605
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:44,940
oh and there's one more thing I wanted

606
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,860
to show you just so you can see that it

607
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,820
works with with bigger apps so here's

608
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,320
there's a big there's an open source

609
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,929
project that sujit wrote first proper

610
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,929
called tasks and this is a big hairy

611
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,700
existing sprout corps app and you load

612
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,169
it up and it loads and these are all

613
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:03,509
custom views and yes in fact you can

614
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:05,820
manipulate all the custom views and do

615
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,950
whatever you want with them so there you

616
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:18,039
go that's greenhouse

617
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,510
ok so that was greenhouse and last thing

618
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,890
we want to do is talk about touch this

619
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,250
may give your hairy palms um warning

620
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:31,350
warning so common knowledge is you know

621
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,240
that touch is actually very difficult to

622
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,529
do and very difficult to do in the web

623
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:37,470
um one of the you know we thought so too

624
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,390
and then we decided hey why don't we

625
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,039
just try this why don't we try to try to

626
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,960
do this gun bunch of guys an apple and

627
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,399
bunch of guys outside in the community

628
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:46,470
started working on it and we worked

629
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,789
really hard over the last I think these

630
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:50,279
last six months or so to get touch

631
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,409
support natively in time inside of

632
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:57,240
sprout core um you know and we it worked

633
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,190
and we actually got it so we actually

634
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,870
have it in it's an edge right now you

635
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,700
know download and start to use it and

636
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,830
it's a very simple API it's almost like

637
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,600
you doing the normal sprach or touch

638
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,370
event I mean a mouse events and

639
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,120
everything like that so um and with very

640
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,409
little extra code so we're going to show

641
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:16,350
you right now is a really boring demo so

642
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,269
these are the sample demo controls in

643
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:20,429
the desktop just so you have for a frame

644
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,230
of reference so so these are the mouse

645
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,470
events this is what it looks like not

646
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,059
really exciting just you know not

647
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,710
anything crazy going on and then

648
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,450
hopefully without too much awkwardness

649
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,570
we will switch ok so about a couple of

650
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,139
months ago a device came out that nobody

651
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:40,830
really paid attention to and we think

652
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,110
this represents one of the greatest

653
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,480
revolutions and web applications it may

654
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,919
not have half eaten fruit on the back

655
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,029
it's probably going to be some other

656
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:50,669
device but the idea of a touch large

657
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:52,860
device that everybody uses is going to

658
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,460
be something that's very very prevalent

659
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:01,350
so let's look at the samples out see

660
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,139
we're gonna have to do some rigging here

661
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:09,929
to get this to work hi guys all right

662
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,480
all right all right it looks pretty good

663
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,610
it's not tear won't some terrible is not

664
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,679
terrible ok so with touch events two

665
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,429
buttons exactly just like it before we

666
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:25,409
have click events on each one of these

667
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:26,230
things

668
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,080
let's go to check boxes click on the

669
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:35,470
checkbox got progress bars so all these

670
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,929
things are the stuff that we've sort of

671
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:42,669
ported over and we've got lists you know

672
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:45,370
they got cool bouncing cruel scrolling

673
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,890
oh sorry there we go see if we get it

674
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,590
okay yeah there you go okay okay so

675
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,410
enough now rotate it oh wait i know it's

676
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,000
fine i got to find we got on okay so you

677
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,010
can see we got the automatic list as a

678
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,590
picker so you get all this for free

679
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,040
because we handle all the extra code for

680
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,950
you here so this is pretty cool touch

681
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,080
it's not up for you know one of the

682
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,790
other difficult things we serve a scroll

683
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,309
lists and a scroll lists see they said

684
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,740
it couldn't be done so you see there

685
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,690
squirt less in there I'm sorry I had a

686
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,730
fireball on my throat okay so this is

687
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,429
really cool it's really exciting uh but

688
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:29,740
let's see what people who do so after we

689
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,660
got the touchdown were working and not

690
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,600
made or the community community got

691
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,330
touched demo we made a call out to see

692
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,400
what people could build with this touch

693
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,470
interface it's like two weeks ago this

694
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,320
is sassy Oh basically hey guys we have a

695
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,030
presentation of james Kalm can you build

696
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,860
us some Touch apps and so in two weeks

697
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,450
we're going to show you three apps that

698
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,870
the guys have thrown together what's up

699
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,030
orange shirt so you guys have seen the

700
00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:00,679
NPR app right sorry so

701
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:02,779
really smooth scrolling we got

702
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,970
multi-touch action going on with this

703
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,690
app let's see I think you can drill into

704
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:14,600
a story like this and it loads we can we

705
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,860
can play the you can listen to her own

706
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:27,919
direction so there's a yeah go back keep

707
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,299
going with all this stuff at the same

708
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:33,559
time so um and so but Mike I wanted to

709
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,119
show them the native app which ones that

710
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,429
oh right this is this is sprout core

711
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:40,100
guys being used on days so this is the

712
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,499
application that people didn't think was

713
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:44,899
going to be able to be made right so I'd

714
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:46,840
like to show you guys the actual NPR app

715
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,450
this is the one that's out on the iPad

716
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,519
normal one on the ipad right this is the

717
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,110
sprout core one no don't cry have more

718
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,779
demos oh yeah it crashes nice so the

719
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,519
sprout for one comes up native one

720
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:03,830
crashes okay all right see you've gotta

721
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:12,460
wait why guys what Oh what does the deal

722
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,320
okay so it doesn't even work okay hang

723
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,909
on so sprout course a big improvement

724
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:18,980
over Objective C because it actually

725
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,029
works all right guys no I'm they worked

726
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,159
really hard on this I know they did okay

727
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,529
there we go there we go okay so let's

728
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:29,090
see if we can do I know if you can see

729
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,710
we can square soon so so you can see

730
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,869
actually the sprout core is hardware

731
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:37,549
accelerated wear this actually has to

732
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:39,049
run through a bunch of stuff it's not as

733
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:40,159
hardware accelerated so it's actually

734
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,590
smoother on the sprout corps app than it

735
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,759
is on the native objective-c and also I

736
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:51,289
think you yeah so there you go so there

737
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:54,129
you go so the app that couldn't be built

738
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:56,509
we didn't think I'm to be honest we

739
00:30:56,509 --> 00:30:57,590
weren't sure it could be built either

740
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,350
and you know we're just blown away with

741
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,389
what some community member was able to

742
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:04,970
build right and to do it so that's not

743
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,369
the only app that we'd like to show

744
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:10,789
fired up dude alright we saw you this is

745
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:12,080
all about the twee

746
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,929
the Twitter okay so I'm not going to

747
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:16,490
bore you guys with writing in my

748
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:30,140
password there you go so we think this

749
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,010
is cool we are building web applications

750
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:36,940
that are as good as the native apps and

751
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,350
with a lot less code I mean these guys

752
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,760
through these things together in a week

753
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,519
and I guarantee you that if you compared

754
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,830
the objective-c code to the JavaScript

755
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,309
code the stock or code you would you

756
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,899
would take the JavaScript code every

757
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:53,299
single time I were trying to log into

758
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:55,580
this twitter app sorry sorry got the

759
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,460
wrong password I know it's calling it

760
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,980
struggle oh it's your mom's password

761
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,850
okay really okay so see bouncing just

762
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,799
like it is and the other cool thing

763
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,529
about this just bouncing scrolls

764
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:11,389
bouncing scroll so all these things are

765
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:14,389
like the normal picker panel we can

766
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:26,220
tweet

767
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,480
typing on the video this is exciting I

768
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,130
know sorry just anything will work yeah

769
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,320
cool all right so the other exciting

770
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
part is all this works offline so you

771
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,180
can actually save this to your home page

772
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,740
and that's actually what this is save to

773
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,180
your home page so it almost acts exactly

774
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,160
like a native app so this is sort of

775
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,290
like a huge revolution that we can see

776
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,610
so we got one more apt to show you guys

777
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,290
this will be a little excitement I got

778
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,990
are you going so this is a little

779
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,780
documentation app yeah I'll hold it for

780
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:05,030
you well oops yes that's the CEOs iPad

781
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:10,010

sprout court docs so really smooth

784
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,010
scrolling you show you how to do the

785
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,720
touch bends so this is explaining how to

786
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,420
do the touch events we can fire up the

787
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,860
example and then we get the little

788
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,900
sample code and we get the multi-touch

789
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,430
so how does this happen it's single

790
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,560
threaded Oh like I don't know where's

791
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,450
the work it's it's the magic of sprout

792
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,250
core and it's little red gnome green

793
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,960

right okay so if you really want to get

796
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,790
worked on their source code that tells

797
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,860
you how to how to write these this is

798
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,330
