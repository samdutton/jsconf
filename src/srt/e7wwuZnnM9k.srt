of different thing and I promise there

12
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,519

00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,729
JavaScript so my name is Michael you may

this is the first time I'm actually

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,750
saying this in public I do textile thing

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,260
in JavaScript and yeah thank you and

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,330
it's funny that at the conference people

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,920
actually like comes up to me saying it

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,870

you actually do for living I'm a Jason

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,450
jr. at a company called scripto which is

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,090
an awesome company who lets me decide my

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,030
title completely based on my side

26
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,850
project scripto is not a textile company

27
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,910

00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,920
awesome company very supportive I get to

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,050
spend two weeks here doing textile

30

research and commuting a commuting to

31
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,990
the company so very grateful for that so

32
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,720
I'm also co-organized with pjs who was

00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,479
I have a be low video we took like that

35
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,180

36
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,670
co-working and meet up and we had a

37
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,220
little drunk we took like maybe full

38
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,800
takes and there's a take of like me

York not only broken Jess but we have

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,790
mahat andreas queen dais Georgie's

46
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,440
clipped so if you visit New York

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,080
literally every week we have a

48
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,210
JavaScript hang out so just let me know

time so here's all the organizers of the

51
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,850
bolo j s family we call it and we i am

52
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,210
very very proud of what we built in new

53
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,820
york community this year we have eight

54
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,420
speakers coming into vjax ases s calm

55
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,270
and jazz conf so very proud of

56
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,880
supportive network that we built so what

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,130
am I talking about today I want to talk

58
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,650
about CS and you might think that like

59
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,380
oh ok CS computer science no I don't

60
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,400
want to talk about computer science

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,620
computer science makes me sad and gray I

62
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,040
want to talk about crafts I hands that

63
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,320
kind of cs and the cross science looks

64
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,570
like this and this is something I've

65
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,060
been doing for a few years more a bit ly

66
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,250
and extensively for past few months

67
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,160
which is I do this intersection of

68
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,430
coding and crafting which mainly for

69
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,170
myself my project is a knitting there is

70
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,570
a little bit of background to why or how

71
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,170
I came to this intersection so I was a

72
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,360
hung nado first I wasn't engineer first

73
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,830
I learned in it when I was seven maybe

74
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,930
once a year I make like a little scarf

75
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,880
and it was something that wasn't like

76
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,130
serious hobby but like a light hobby

77
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,500
that I do every year four years ago I

78
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,300
moved to New York City I didn't have a

79
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,090
work visa so I had nothing to do and I

80
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,300
was so bored that bored enough to put

81
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,360
myself into learning to code um I've

82
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,940
been in tech industry for my career and

83
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,860
I was a p.m. so like I was comfortable

84
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,750
with like talking about tiki stuff but

85
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,450
never got around actually learning to

86
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,550
code but I was bored enough to put

87
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,170
myself into JavaScript tutorial and

88
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,510
doing that i noticed that like Oh

89
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,970
javascript is actually helpful for my

90
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,010
knitting and I dug up the tweet that I

91
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,350
do member that I tweeted about this and

92
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,850
it's in Japanese so you can't leave you

93
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,280
lead it maybe some of you can but it's

94
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,230
hang that like oh I need a discount

95
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,300
erful project that I'm doing to keep

96
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,010
track of like how many lows that I knit

97
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,590
I learned java script so in 30 minutes i

98
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,660
use the plaza and dom and that was super

99
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,240
useful fun that's 2013 8 months before i

100
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,940
get a job as a javascript engineer so

101
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,400
when i'm doing knitting in the

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,560
JavaScript learning JavaScript I noticed

103
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,540
there is a correlation between needing

104
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,350
and coding and knitting is very binary

105
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,419
processed much like programming is ones

106
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,020
and zeros atomic unit for knitting is

107
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,700
two stitches the type of stitches knit

108
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,310
stitch and purl stitch and you can see

109
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,880
there that there is a two distinct face

110
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,430
of the fabric that they produce so if

111
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,990
you look if you have a sweater you can

112
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,970
just look at the pattern of it it is a

113
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,729
combination of knit or purl stitches in

114
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:17,479
here represented as a KO key so the two

115
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,419
by two living that's all sometimes using

116
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,190
the cuff of your sweater or neckline is

117
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,340
a to knit stitches to purl stitches and

118
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,530
the one on the left is a little more

119
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,510
into get pattern but if you just closely

120
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,860
look at it it is the alternate KPK p

121
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,160
slightly shifting to the left on top of

122
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,380
that the instruction of how to make

123
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,620
scarf or how do you make a sweater comes

124
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,880
in this form and to me it looks a lot

125
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,280
like code there is like a leap heating

126
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,039
letters and maybe some kind of valuables

127
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,919
there is a more explicit loop happening

128
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,630
like knit until two stitches remaining

129
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,350
goalie Pete from spar to the end so that

130
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,930
means you can knit in JavaScript because

131
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,330
knitting is code so let's take a look at

132
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,600
this pattern for the first line says co5

133
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,240
and let's just do it in JavaScript socio

134
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,150
means cast on and that means that just

135
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,180
create a space so that you can start

136
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,669
it's not a stitch yet so it's kind of

137
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:21,560
like you're cleaning empty LA but like

138
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,030
links of five and casting on so next

139
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,690
line is k 5 and k stands for knit stitch

140
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,880
and 5 means how many times you need to

141
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,950
do it so that means this line is saying

142
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,709
like knit five stitches

143
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,989
so I cleated the value of okay who is

144
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:42,259
litter capital k and they placed a low

145
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,619
zero with 5 case in it fallout you put

146
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,929
it into my scarf parent LA and now you

147
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:51,889
need it one low in JavaScript the second

148
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,479
line gets a little tricky so the thing

149
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,610
about knitting is that it's Oh episode

150
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,599
on the needle so the previous la the

151
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,939
links of the previous la always inherit

152
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,739
it to the next low like you can't start

153
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,329
the five stitches and then next low be

154
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:07,849
100 stitches well technically there is a

155
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:08,959
way to do it but like a little more

156
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,189
complicated so you inherit the links

157
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:15,529
from the previous low could a new la and

158
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:17,209
then from there you count how many

159
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:19,579
stitches and what to do so the first one

160
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,949
we already know k 2 means knit two

161
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,889
stitches so I put knit stitches count up

162
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,839
the index so now you have a two stitches

163
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,869
in your La next one is a new concept m1

164
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:32,779
which is make one stitches and it's a

165
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,819
lot like operating the splice method on

166
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,469
yo la and putting in like another

167
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:38,749
element into your la so like you know

168
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,239
past the index where you are put the new

169
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:44,509
stitches now the LA is length of 6 and

170
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,749
then here you have a loop and it's

171
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:50,689
saying that how many ever you have on

172
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,729
your needles just knit until last

173
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,999
remaining two stitches so in this case

174
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:59,899
you only put one stitches but you do the

175
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:01,489
while loop until the remaining stitches

176
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:05,689
or two and next one we already did that

177
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:08,059
like same thing like eating make one now

178
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,399
your legs it's seven and then you two

179
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,339
now your second law is complete push it

180
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:15,319
through the my parent my scarf away and

181
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,979
now you have to erase or to lowes of

182
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:21,559
knitted fabric there so continue in

183
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:24,079
doing that it looks like this to create

184
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,279
a triangle-shaped scarf and what I

185
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,679
always thought was that the meaning is

186
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,689
like you are compiling your code or

187
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:34,120
knitting pattern in your brain

188
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,089
interpreting it and then executing the

189
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:40,550
computation on your hand and needles so

190
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,610
that the flea yarn that the yambo is a

191
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,399
flea memory and then the fabric is

192
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,779
allocated memory

193
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,130
now do you ugly that the knitting is

194
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,240
like coding yeah yeah on top of that

195
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,100
when you're designing your own knitted

196
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,160
fabric it is a lot like math like

197
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,870
calculator is your friend you need a

198
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,960
graph paper Here I am deciding on the

199
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,940
design of the slope of the armhole and

200
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,160
then trying to decide how to decrease it

201
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,970
so that it comes naturally to my bus

202
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,779
line and you need to fit it in fit the

203
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:19,870
patterns into a certain public the

204
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,060
Allstate it's a lot turns into like a

205
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,730
puzzle because you don't want the nice

206
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,190
piece of pattern to be ended on the side

207
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,010
you want it to be center so I enjoy that

208
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,020
and I have a tendency that like if I

209
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,150
like something I just go to you like

210
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,150
that thing forever and I don't sleep and

211
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,490
then go like deep deep down down there

212
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,529
so like Eileen II wanted to investigate

213
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:43,660
a lot of Potter making a lot of knitting

214
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,690
I found although hun inning takes time

215
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,550
and then I found the machine code

216
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,580
knitting machine which lets me make

217
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,820
public way faster than I hum net and

218
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,190
this is me creating a scarf that I have

219
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,490
in here but it's basically a machine

220
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,779
that lets me do my job faster it is not

221
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,270
a new thing my machine is from 80s and

222
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,560
these machine has been around things

223
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,800
1500 my machine turned out to be a

224
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,589
electro knit which is a computer

225
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,529
operated machine that lets me send the

226
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:23,130
data into the machine so that I can

227
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,040
program the pattern and I did a little

228
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,770
bit of a project about taking a digital

229
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,560
photo image turning in to bitmap image

230
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,930
turning into ones and zeros away turn it

231
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,209
into that file by bit shifting and then

232
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:39,790
printing out in my knitting machine and

233
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,580
I gave a talk about that at rjs conf us

234
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,160
past May and if you have any question or

235
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,510
if you want to know more about how i did

236
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,450
it i'm happy to talk so later but today

237
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,940
i will talk about what came after that

238
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,870
project so my machine was the first one

239
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,240
to have a computer operated version but

240
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,920
the version before was using

241
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,220
being cold punch guard and I have it

242
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,670
here and in investigating how knitting

243
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,040
machine works I was super fascinated

244
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,630
first of all this is beautiful

245
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,440
and I was so fascinated that I can

246
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,290
control the machine by just perforated

247
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,889
paper punch guard and I again go down

248
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,120
the lab at whole of researching

249
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,459
something and I realize that punch cards

250
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:28,760
are actually cool it touches at some

251
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,949
point of history it touches automation

252
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:34,010
of the Machine and computation of doing

253
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,380
the bath on the data and then touches a

254
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,540
communication and all of three which I

255
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,060
consider a base of computer and internet

256
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,699
and like what we deal with every day

257
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:45,470
punch core touch that in history so a

258
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,360
little bit of information let's talk

259
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,800
about like what automation so in 1745

260
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,470
Jack Kevorkian was commissioned by

261
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,600
French government to create an automated

262
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,320
job textile loom for local silk industry

263
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,019
and he was the first one I mean before

264
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:05,180
that there was like a concept of using a

265
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,130
punch core to operate the machine but he

266
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,529
was the first one to make up for fully

267
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,839
automated loom operated by punch card

268
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,320
didn't get picked up quite well until

269
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,019
1800 when Joseph merely jacquard picked

270
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:23,060
up the project and then included and

271
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,850
created this famous loom called jacquard

272
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,300
loom side note it's interesting that the

273
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,060
the British text Islanders were an

274
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,540
industry was up-and-coming so Napoleon

275
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,220
spend money actually on the local

276
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,040
business the Leon and they got like

277
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,050
increasing number of order so they need

278
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,560
a machine to make those order and he was

279
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,779
commissioned by a merchant and beyond to

280
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,110
clear those machine this is a jacquard

281
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,690
loom that I just took part of my

282
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,790
research trip to textile museum in

283
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,589
Netherland this is how it works it's

284
00:12:57,589 --> 00:12:59,480
feeding the punch card and then

285
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,930
selecting the thread in the machine to

286
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,269
create a textile pattern and here's a

287
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:07,880
jiff animation from five years animation

288
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,459
from Victoria and Albert Museum

289
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,560
basically upon score gets pushed Lords

290
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,880
are pushed or not pushed

291
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,580
and then the Slayer attached to that is

292
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,020
picked up by and then wait for it goes

293
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,720
down there to show yes this is how

294
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,680
pixels or select it so this is another

295
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,810
fine from the textile museum it is

296
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,480
discussing mechanism of the jacquard

297
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,430
loom but to me it looks a lot like

298
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,830
explaining how computer graphics and

299
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,170
pixel works and I was like so like

300
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,080
fascinated by that when I found out so

301
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,540
that was just using punch cord to

302
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,340
operate a machine like how about

303
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,120
computation part so cold sackhoff was

304
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,940
the first one to know to use the punch

305
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,190
court as a data storage and he was a

306
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,920
statistician who wanted to do faster

307
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,880
work on his research he proposed this

308
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,760
thing called linear home scope and

309
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,520
basically it is a shelf with the hole

310
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,060
and data in it he pleads a pins kind of

311
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,490
like a query he learns that pin over the

312
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,440
shelf and then if that came matches with

313
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,720
the whole you find the data faster than

314
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,170
going through by hand another one

315
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,280
Charles Babbage from England could he

316
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,200
planned the famous machine analytical

317
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,200
engine which use punch cord as a data

318
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,720
input and Charles Babbage was the one

319
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,820
the Ada Lovelace was exchanging a letter

320
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,120
which we some of you may know that he

321
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,000
became first computer program Lovelace

322
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,060
made a beautiful beautiful quote about

323
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,010
this machine saying the analytical

324
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,170
engine weaves all algebraic patterns

325
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,060
just like a jacquard loom leaves flowers

326
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:00,810
and leaves like great back in united

327
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,330
states in the united states there was

328
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,160
another attempt to use punch cord for

329
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,560
computation which is by home and hollis

330
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,130
in 1889 he created this machine code

331
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,930
tabulating machine it's basically punch

332
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,690
court's order to sort out data faster

333
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,140
and it came out of need from US Census

334
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,840
so US Census happens every ten years and

335
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,860
the census in 1880 took nine years to

336
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,690
compile that data because they did not

337
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,730
have any

338
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,899
equipment there was a lot of immigrant

339
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,120
coming in they did the hunt compile of

340
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,920
the data and it took nine years so like

341
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,749
why by the time you get old analysis

342
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:38,399
done you know another sensors what's

343
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,139
happening and it was gonna be problem

344
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,269
the next census so he created the

345
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,629
machine called tabulating machine and

346
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:47,910
here is a picture of Lady inputting the

347
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,639
data into a punch card by the way the

348
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,319
tabulating machine company through

349
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,809
different acquisition became what is

350
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,149
known as IBM right now and then now it

351
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:58,980
all makes sense that the IBM machine

352
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,149
punch card it all came from there so the

353
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:05,220
communications part also attached on the

354
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,439
perforated paper roll punch card before

355
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,059
going to the punch core there's like a

356
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,620
little prehistory 1864 there was a first

357
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,269
telegraph service happening between

358
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:18,240
Washington DC and New York it used the

359
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,040
piano like keyboard and then two

360
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,559
operators were sitting at the end

361
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,149
appearing the thing and soon they

362
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,889
realized that they need to have a

363
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:29,759
standard communication way so the bow

364
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,309
dog amilo balda in france created this

365
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:35,430
five bit five you know ones in zero

366
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,920
system called bout it system and adopted

367
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,120
in france but then in 1901 Donald Murray

368
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,699
was the first one who introduced this

369
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,759
use of perforated paper or punch card as

370
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,139
a part of teletype so what he introduced

371
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,759
was that instead of like typing and

372
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,100
ending the data immediately just type it

373
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,319
into the paper and then create the paper

374
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:01,230
so so that the papers like those dolls

375
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,110
are queued up and it doesn't basically

376
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,350
the process becomes nonlinear and you

377
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,380
can queue up the data he actually walked

378
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,559
on the bow to code and became what is

379
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,120
known as international Telegraph

380
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,600
alphabet which still use the five bit so

381
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,689
they need it like space to represent all

382
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,909
the letters and they introduce the idea

383
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,549
of shifting and that's why you have a

384
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,730
shift key in your computer so basically

385
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,450
they have a figure and letters and

386
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,970
whenever that the shift two letters

387
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,860
signal happens then after that

388
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,530
everything gets lead as a letters and

389
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:40,870
then

390
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,809
you see the shift to figure signal

391
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,880
happens then after that everything after

392
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,540
that is lead as a figure of course if

393
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,400
you talk about the encoding system i

394
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,590
have to mention ascii which is American

395
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,430
Standard Code for information

396
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,460
interchange somebody did not really

397
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,530
think about diversity somebody saw 7-bit

398
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,720
is enough letters to the prince and all

399
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,640
the communication letter which is not

400
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,300
enough but they let use the 128

401
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,520
characters but then computer happened

402
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,400
the computers are a bit and like who are

403
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,890
not level of bits now available to you

404
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,350
and there was a lot of multiple

405
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,510
standards like Nordic country started

406
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,070
making their own standards because they

407
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,929
needed their own letters to be

408
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:25,750
represented country like Japan my home

409
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,790
country decided to this weird thing

410
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,280
called multi-byte encoding which is very

411
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,990
programmatic when you are dealing with

412
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,980
Japanese computer program till this day

413
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,660
um then there was a vodka unicode unique

414
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,059
unified universal encoding and if any of

415
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:45,120
you want to geek out about like how

416
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,820
awesome you t expect is like i'm more

417
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,010
than happy to do that but not going into

418
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,710
today so i was like after this like holy

419
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,390
search i was like wow that was a lot of

420
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,420
wikipedia lead but then like punch card

421
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,309
is like actually really cool I want to

422
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:04,210
make one so i quickly prototype dip out

423
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,420
of team foil and nope card and jumper

424
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,260
wires didn't nearly walk out so my part

425
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,059
was that the the jumper wire is a leader

426
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:15,490
so like kind of like moves through it

427
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,559
and then lead it but didn't really work

428
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,900
i went back to lie collisional drawing

429
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,940
of like how jock Harlan was made and

430
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,240
then like sketched up how it's gonna get

431
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,040
hit down to my friends with job cut some

432
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,370
good measure some things pork some hole

433
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,070
put the contact sheet on it and then

434
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,620
forget to algae we know and then now

435
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,010
that's there so I have that machine here

436
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,890
and I wrote an interpreter so basically

437
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,480
the machine itself is just leading a

438
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,850
data the data and then what to do with

439
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,679
it afterwards up to me as a computer

440
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,179
programmer so i created this demo site

441
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,020
electromechanical the computer by the

442
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,550
way i'm so so

443
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:00,160
no my domain purchased that was

444
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
available by the way doc computer space

445
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,720
wide open you should you should check

446
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,680
that um so I'm going into the demo site

447
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,540
and I have a punch card that made put it

448
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,000
onto the machine on the side and it's

449
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:28,140
seif since yay so that's ! and this one

450
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,270
that's a little I oh I'm doing demo

451
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,720
backwards it what's supposed to say hi

452
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:45,620
there

453
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,049
so so I created two demos one is leading

454
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,420
the same la the binary are a turning

455
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,190
into ascii character so you can see the

456
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,900
letters the other one is much like a

457
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,120
jacquard loom trying to create a textile

458
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,600
pattern so a little bit about how this

459
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,750
thing hole gets together each pins that

460
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,990
a pins are buttons so i use it Johnny 5

461
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,270
and then created the eight buttons and

462
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,820
each button has a events / hold all

463
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,130
these so every time the button gets hold

464
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,770
is okay socket i/o to omit the WebSocket

465
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,440
to my server and then same as a release

466
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,290
and every time that event immediate i

467
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,260
send the index of which pin was hold or

468
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,110
live east on the server side it's very

469
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,660
simple i always have a pattern eight

470
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,120
zeros and then whenever socket comes in

471
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,760
we placed our index with one and then

472
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,080
purse that data into ASCII characters on

473
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,740
the demo of the textile side I use the

474
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,100
same LA to see if it's zero create a

475
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,620
white canvas box and then if it's one

476
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,730
create a black canvas box so after this

477
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,370
exercise I was like I finally understand

478
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,880
how code works and computer Lee's my

479
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,460
code this is super cool I can create my

480
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,309
own punch card language in you know

481
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:08,890
whatever way but then like dealing with

482
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,010
binary is not as friendly as you think

483
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,990
it's just like you are always looking at

484
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,260
art of like binary to hex to octal to

485
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,460
it's just not fun likely as JavaScript

486
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,190
programmers have a way to do this in

487
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,860
JavaScript and skip hole punch card and

488
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,049
binary system which is make your own

489
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:31,870
parser so this summer I tended the

490
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,160
program called school for poetic

491
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,590
computation and their attended the class

492
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,559
by solid golf Miller called talking to

493
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,350
machines those assholes and it was

494
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,350
basically a class about how to create

495
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,630
your own domain specific language and

496
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,580
how to create a parser for it so I use a

497
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,740
library called Peggy is which is a

498
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,500
parser generator for JavaScript and they

499
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,850
have like nice interface folder online

500
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,730
editing they have a so basically you

501
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,700
create your own glamour in pegs way and

502
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,040
then peg compile it into generator and

503
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,850
then they have a little interactive

504
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,860
tester to see if it works so let's see

505
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,090
they have a simple glamour define and

506
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,280
then in here they have white space

507
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
defined so what if I don't want any

508
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,060
white space in my language that I'm

509
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,070
designing so like I just get a little of

510
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,640
that then now the parcel is yelling at

511
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,680
that like I am not expect expecting

512
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,600
white space there is white space so like

513
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,630
I get a little bit then it will say /

514
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,220
successfully so I did this exercise for

515
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,770
my thing and created my own domain

516
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,340
specific language called 64 stitches and

517
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,980
specifically in the purpose to teach

518
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,670
programmers how knitters lead knitting

519
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,270
patterns so the D language itself is

520
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,180
designed to look like exactly like a

521
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,720
knitting pattern instead of using K&P I

522
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,730
use underscore and asterisks to the

523
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,100
present a white space in black space so

524
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,430
that kind of like being able to see it

525
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,980
visually um so let's zoom in if I so

526
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,810
remember when we did the JavaScript

527
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,350
knitting cast on is how how wide the

528
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,540
start with it so if i change that cast

529
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:31,250
on eight to 16 it's wider width and then

530
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,410
if i go to like a weird one that's like

531
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,320
four then oh it's not the weird it's

532
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,380
like three completely changes the shape

533
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,380
of the pattern and then you can change

534
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,990
that to be completely white low or

535
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,520
completely black low notice that the

536
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,940
until 32 stitches remaining I

537
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,980
specifically Royals parser so that the

538
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,110
programming language that I that user

539
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,860
need to use is a language that the

540
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,990
knitting machine uses so I made that and

541
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,900
I tweeted thinking that maybe 10 of my

542
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,620
friends

543
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,980
nerd about things would like it and I

544
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,910
never expected to get this much positive

545
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:24,890
feedback um I was never like a popular

546
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,570
JavaScript library programmer so like I

547
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,350
was like wow people are weird people

548
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,200
like weird stuff but it was great a lot

549
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,970
of like London people started tweeting

550
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,710
at me there screen shot of their code

551
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,390
and the pattern because i made the

552
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,230
online app to be interactive so that the

553
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,870
patent that the code itself always gets

554
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,940
compiled every time the key up event

555
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,070
happens and change the pattern so i

556
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,460
added the feature to for those to say

557
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
the pattern and here is some example

558
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,260
this user i'm like particularly plow

559
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,140
that at my code or sample was clear

560
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,750
enough that she used loop in her coat

561
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,960
and a lot of people ended up using that

562
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,270
as like a mini pixel orange in the later

563
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,870
so here's a cat here's a skull and

564
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:19,460
invaders and of course jeaious lighting

565
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,920
my own parser turned out to be great

566
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,700
exercise in learning ideas and computer

567
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,320
science that i never learned because i

568
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,300
did not take computer science which is

569
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,059
abstraction the writing glamour for the

570
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,520
passer is basically like saying like in

571
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,980
English you have like noun and verb and

572
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,110
you know it has to go in a certain order

573
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,720
same thing like I have to define what

574
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,760
castellón is and I have to define what

575
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,130
loop is and then going into smaller

576
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,010
chunks smaller chunks small chunk and

577
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,830
kind of like learn oh this is what

578
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,150
abstraction people are talking about

579
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:57,980
this is I get it now and also I stopped

580
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,610
being mad at the JavaScript console

581
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,860
yelling at me on the eller because I

582
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,080
learned that the lighting meaningful

583
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,170
eller for the parser is super hard so

584
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,300
now like undefined is not a function I'm

585
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,880
okay with that

586
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,200
so what's next I have no idea I really

587
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,440
don't I'm just like way into this punch

588
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,700
car thing and I want to clean my own

589
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,279
language and now I don't know what comes

590
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,889
next although I have few ideas of what i

591
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:31,289
wouldn't do next one just put

592
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:34,260
the code on github I'm like the person

593
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,330
food cleats like empty github repo

594
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,580
saying like this will be this project

595
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,289
and never puts the code in and like I

596
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:41,730
have no laser vision of putting in

597
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,200
closed source or anything I'm just being

598
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,080
lazy so I'll do that and then next one

599
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,279
is like I want to make an appt for

600
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,250
knitter so this year I've had a great

601
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,010
opportunity a lot of opportunity to talk

602
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,710
to people like you techies about like

603
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,870
how knitting is like a code and how

604
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,269
knitting can teach your computer science

605
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:04,710
but knitters themselves who does not use

606
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,740
my hack on my code contribute a lot to

607
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,960
what I do which is creating a patterns

608
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,730
cleaning instruction for knitting

609
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,159
machines so I want to make a tool for

610
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,490
them so that they can put more into this

611
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,269
research and nearly what i wanna do is

612
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,850
like explore the idea of like cleft as a

613
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,269
computer science and I'm ed I've never

614
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:29,880
like computer science until I did this

615
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,039
project and then now I really want to

616
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,570
learn about what computer science is

617
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,120
about so hopefully in past 30 minutes I

618
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,820
convinced you that this picture not only

619
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,919
looks like a class project but looks

620
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,429
like computer science projects you

621
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:49,529
here's a list of resources that i have

622
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:52,620
my projects on and the last one is the

623
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,230
one that's empty repo i will put the

624
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,620
code in I have a few samples that I made

625
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,980
all of the scarfs or JavaScript powered

626
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,269
I made it d three tard put that SPG file

627
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:08,399
into knitting pattern and then knit it

628
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,470
in you know the file that was created by

629
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,320
javascript and remember that my first

630
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,630
slide that has a lead xjs and kind of

631
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,029
like a glove paper i created a lace

632
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:22,110
pattern for the lead exeis scarf which i

633
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,600
don't know if you can see can you see

634
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,870
the j logo

635
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:29,710
here yeah yeah so if you want to see

636
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:42,220
that happy to show it

637
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,770
and just because i am obligated i have a

638
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,650
broken jess speaker stickers if you want

639
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:57,590
to come find me thank you very much
