1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:19,940
- So, welcome everyone.

2
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:31,460
I'm going to talk about using the web for
music productions and live performance.

3
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,460
I'm Jan.

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,460
Of Thedeftone.

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,940
Frontend Developer from Berlin.

6
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,290
I don't have a musical background, but I'm
very passionate about music.

7
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,170
Ic is wrong.

8
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,890
Hin 2004 I had this band.

9
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,420
We had this website.

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,420
We didn't have songs.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,730
We were geeks.

12
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,200
We wanted to have an awesome website.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,570
We had the best name.

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,780
We didn't know what Png alpha was.

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,729
That's my musical background.

16
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:11,740
Not fancy zozer But audio on the web has a
dark history.

17
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,299
If you look at Bgsound.

18
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,560
Who here knows it?

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,229
We have all been there.

20
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:26,470
You could use it for background of your page.

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,759
The possibility to use flash or Java.

22
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:33,750
To replay songs on your website.

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,670
It doesn't feel nice.

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,479
It is not the web technology.

25
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,930
It is just Java and Flash.

26
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,070
Finally we had the audio tag.

27
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:49,230
We could stream and analyse audio.

28
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,590
Everything was good.

29
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,590
Until the point where we wanted to do more.

30
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,580
Than just listening to music.

31
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:02,270
Because, we also want to create filters.

32
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,270
Create music.

33
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:10,849
And so, Mozilla came up with the Audio Data
Api.

34
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:12,799
Which allowed you to create music.

35
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,010
But, in a nice way.

36
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,370
It had some flaws.

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,269
Chris Rogers came up with Web Audio Api.

38
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:23,870
It is an awesome Api.

39
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,510
When I looked at this, it looked like the
history of layouting.

40
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,220
We had frames.

41
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,590
Nobody uses it anymore, I hope.

42
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,120
And then we advances to table layout.

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,650
We know table layouts work.

44
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,650
So does object.

45
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,480
It nas ot the nicest thing to use.

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,870
Then we advanced to float layout.

47
00:02:50,870 --> 00:03:00,159
Everything was nice zozer You still had to
use some hacks like clear fixes zozer You

48
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,219
had Flexbox version 1.

49
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,069
Which we then dropped.

50
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,819
And we had Flexbox.

51
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,120
That's the history of audio on the web.

52
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,280
The Web Audio api gives you a low level access
to all things audio.

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,739
You can create sounds.

54
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,739
From scratch.

55
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,890
You can manipulate sounds with filters.

56
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,469
Time sounds precisely.

57
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:29,419
It is very precise.

58
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:31,689
Tons of other cool stuff that I will not mention.

59
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,579
Spatial audio.

60
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,239
For 3D games.

61
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,439
An audio source from that direction.

62
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,099
You can use it.

63
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,799
So, there are many demo's with the web audio
api.

64
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,589
I want to make a real software with the web
audio Api.

65
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:54,560
I had a professor at the uni.

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,599
I had a nice title for the thetis.

67
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,309
Building a collaborative music production
environment using emerging web standards.

68
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:10,529
I wanted to create music production software
that runs in your browser.

69
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:13,840
We are on the web.

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,249
So we could use web technology.

71
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:17,889
To make bands interact.

72
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,889
If they work remotely.

73
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:21,889
The first thing I did.

74
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,310
I was an academia.

75
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,680
As you analyse things.

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,870
I had to look at the audio editors.

77
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,730
Years of development and best practices.

78
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,680
They have common interface patterns.

79
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,490
I wanted to get a minimum feature set.

80
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,060
I had 6 months of time.

81
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,789
I needed to define what to do to make people
use it.

82
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,710
I looked at garageband.

83
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,070
You have the controls over here, tracks.

84
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,220
Previews of the songs.

85
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,419
It looks easy to use.

86
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,490
If you look at Ableton.

87
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,360
More professional.

88
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,610
You have some controls over here.

89
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,680
The tracks, also.

90
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
And some previews.

91
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,310
And the same image is in all the others.

92
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,790
Reason.

93
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,169
So, analysing audio editors.

94
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,719
Timeline.

95
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,100
Previews and depending on content, they are
different.

96
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,340
If you have drums it is not a waveform.

97
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,860
You have tracks as rows.

98
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,620
And what you need is a way to record stuff.

99
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,100
You need to be able to import stuff.

100
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,419
Also you need a drum.

101
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,719
People can come up with awesomesongs.

102
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:43,340
And synthesizer for nice melodies.

103
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,150
That's what I needed to do.

104
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,450
This is what it looks like in the end.

105
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,660
You can see the pattern, the controls, tracks,
previews.

106
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,320
This is synthesizer, drum track.

107
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,009
As I said before, there is one more thing.

108
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,129
Because all the other editors were missing
collaboration.

109
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,539
This has collaboration built in.

110
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,460
This is what I want to demo now.

111
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,240
No.

112
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,060
Before I want to talk about why we need it?

113
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
Collaboration.

114
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,759
It is awesome for remote band brainstorming.

115
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:27,300
A band, a guy from London and Berlin and you
can jam.

116
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,470
You want to have auto save and auto backup.

117
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,310
There is one problem.

118
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,250
It is sadly not offline.

119
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,090
Sorry, team Hoodie.

120
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,569
Well, offline first.

121
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,389
Demo time.

122
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:43,919
Let's show this.

123
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,749
I will just...

124
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:48,139
Go into the editor.

125
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,210
Quickly.

126
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,580
Open this one.

127
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,909
Open the communication panel.

128
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:58,080
Oh, hey guys!

129
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,719
So, I want to introduce you to...

130
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:05,169
My brother.

131
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:06,169
Say hi.

132
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:17,560
I hope you can hear me.

133
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,139
Do something?

134
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:25,139
It is good!

135
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,139
Perfect.

136
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,139
(applause)

137
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,139
in my hometown in the west of Germany.

138
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,740
And Will from Berlin.

139
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,060
How are you doing?

140
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,560
Say something?

141
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,169
Do something?

142
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,840
So beautiful!

143
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,500
So...

144
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,169
(applause)

145
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,020
normally you can see my face here.

146
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,840
I don't know why it is not working zozer Ready
to jam?

147
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,600
You can't hear the voices.

148
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,880
You will only hear the instruments.

149
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,469
Go for it, guys!

150
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:04,469
Awesome.

151
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,849
We see you later.

152
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,770
I will not show you how they jam.

153
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,870
I want to show you the editor.

154
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,180
I want to show it is really working.

155
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,210
I have the editor here.

156
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,349
Synthesizer track, drum track and audio track.

157
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:29,419
Synthesizer, if I doubleclick here, I can
add the nodes.

158
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:32,789
Make them longer.

159
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,789
You have a lot of settings.

160
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,779
It is made up of oscillators that create the
sound.

161
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,469
You can define the type.

162
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:44,339
A lot of settings.

163
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,070
I will try to play something.

164
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,370
Not really awesome.

165
00:08:48,370 --> 00:09:03,280
So you have an idea what it sounds like.

166
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,310
You have some filters that change the sound.

167
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:20,199
You have an oscillator which is not playing
at the moment.

168
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,060
This is the built in synthesizer.

169
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,050
Then we have the drum machine.

170
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,160
You can edit.

171
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,410
You can see the updates in here.

172
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:38,250
Let's just play the drums.

173
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,370
, this is, the interface is set timeout and
interval.

174
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,930
Is it too loud?

175
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,070
Sorry.

176
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,210
Perfect.

177
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,860
But the sound is timed in the web audio.

178
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,790
If you have a drummer timed with a set timeout,
your band is going nowhere.

179
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,440
It will add up to the end.

180
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,750
It will be horrible.

181
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,329
You can do that in the editor.

182
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:09,690
You can have different patterns.

183
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,160
Like this one.

184
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
That's cool.

185
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,779
And, you can also just play audio.

186
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:20,210
Or you can record stuff.

187
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,110
This is what I am doing now.

188
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,130
This is done with Getusermedia.

189
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,850
The microphone input.

190
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,850
Perfect.

191
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,779
There is a signal coming.

192
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:37,019
I will just say, hello JSconf.

193
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,190
I can upload the recording.

194
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:44,630
In the file browser I will drag it in.

195
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:49,470
And I can arrange it a bit.

196
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,899
And then I can just...

197
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,019
The play button.

198
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,420
I solo's this one.

199
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,990
The play button will trigger the global playback.

200
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,990
Yeah...

201
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,230
It works.

202
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,550
(applause)

203
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,889
okay.

204
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:17,360
But this is not showing the collaboration
feature.

205
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,820
The collaboration works like this.

206
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,270
So I have another instance here.

207
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,100
And I can just add an new track.

208
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,610
The layout is broken.

209
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,149
It is immediately over here.

210
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:37,580
I can edit here and it will show here.

211
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,570
Hello, J Sconf.

212
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:48,620
Everything I do is synced in realtime.

213
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,240
It is kind of complicated.

214
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,709
Everything is synced all the time.

215
00:11:54,709 --> 00:12:01,100
This is what the friends are doing.

216
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,730
We can go back and check how far they are.

217
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,940
Hope it works.

218
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940
Well...

219
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,940
No...

220
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,880
Let me just talk to them.

221
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,880
My brother is gone!

222
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,800
It is not working?

223
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,399
We can't hear him.

224
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,290
He is gone as well.

225
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,300
Well...

226
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,830
Let's see if they have recorded something.

227
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,759
That's cool.

228
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,500
We obviously agreed on a song.

229
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,950
No, something is happening.

230
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,950
Okay.

231
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,480
This is Will editing the stuff.

232
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,029
Faster, Will!

233
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:54,800
Perfect.

234
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,350
That's easy.

235
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,750
So, this will be the guitar.

236
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,170
I guess.

237
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,300
Because I know.

238
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,290
I will turn it up a bit.

239
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,810
Drums down a bit.

240
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,280
Move it a bit here.

241
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,540
Let's see if it works.

242
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,720
Maybe you remember the song.

243
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,180
Awesome.

244
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:36,959
They just made that.

245
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,600
(applause)

246
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,519
let's say bye.

247
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,800
It worked.

248
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,440
Awesome.

249
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,090


250
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,259
See you later.

251
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,770
You have a beer for free at the party.

252
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,300
My brother is coming back.

253
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,610
Too late!

254
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,269
Perfect.

255
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:01,930
Okay.

256
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,759
That worked very well.

257
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,570
That was the end result of my thesis.

258
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,990
I think you can already kinda use it.

259
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,519
I want to talk about live music performance.

260
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,970
How you can do it in the werb audio Api.

261
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,449
You can use the instrument.

262
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:21,170
Use it for amplification.

263
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:26,370
We have seen it yesterday.

264
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:32,220
On top of that, Jan did the the live code
of the track.

265
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,879
With his livecoder.

266
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:39,980
I want to focus on using Midi devices to control
your application.

267
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,779
To control my editor.

268
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,829
And I want to introduce you to the Glitch
Mob.

269
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:49,649
One of the bands I like.

270
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,850
Everything you see.

271
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,829
They are an electronic music band.

272
00:14:54,829 --> 00:15:03,610
They do songs only with Midi devices.

273
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:15,570
It sounds like this.

274
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,770
You can hear, you have drum parts, vocals.

275
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,500
That are invoced.

276
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,450
I thought, I want to do that as well.

277
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,139
So, the setup looks like this.

278
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:30,260
The 3 guys.

279
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,629
They talk midi to your software.

280
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:41,550
The problem is, neither do I have people of
dinger that including that.

281
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,129
Nor do I have the midi instruments and software.

282
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:49,329
Turns out, you can do that on your own.

283
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:52,740
This is one of the dj's from Japan.

284
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,620
Broken Haze.

285
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,930
It is only him performing.

286
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,209
And that inspired me a lot.

287
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:17,889
It sounds something like this.

288
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,980
And he is doing that alone on stage with drums
and his iPad.

289
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,670
It is amazing.

290
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,370
If he can do that alone, maybe I can do that.

291
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,089
And what I needed for that is the web midi
Api.

292
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:37,649
Again, if we talk about Midi it is not midi
background stuff.

293
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:42,660
It is the protocol for digital instruments
that sends data to your application.

294
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,720
The midi api is in an early stage.

295
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,860
It works in Chrome only.

296
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,380
Firefox people...

297
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:58,680
No, you have seen nothing!

298
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,199
The webmidi api is developed in Japan.

299
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:06,630
They are freaky and I love that.

300
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,020
They love the webmedia api and do tons of
shit with it.

301
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,510
They have a mascotte.

302
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,510
Midiappy.

303
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,890
It has 2 midi outputs here.

304
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,180
It is all over the world.

305
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,270
In the web.

306
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,270
That's not enough.

307
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,690
They made an animation.

308
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,920
Well, enough about that.

309
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,670
I need to use that.

310
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,730
So, let's talk about Js live performances.

311
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:47,750
Last year I did a live performance.

312
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,870
I was using the game controller Api.

313
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,540
That was cool.

314
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,950
If you have been there to the Reject Js.

315
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:02,620
The worldpremiere of the semicolons.

316
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,700
They were using.

317
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,150
I'm part of the band.

318
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,080
We are using the Web audio Api as well.

319
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,480
You have seen the introduction yesterday.

320
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,310
It was all done in Web audio.

321
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,670
Amazing.

322
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:21,690
I hope that you are ready for another demo.

323
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,120
That I will do right now.

324
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,380
And I need to plug in my iPad.

325
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:33,810
S just bear with me a bit.

326
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,260
And...

327
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:45,030
Need to put this on.

328
00:18:45,030 --> 00:19:08,930
Here we go.

329
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:18,010
I hope this works.

330
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:31,650
Enjoy this.

331
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:46,530
I hope I am not being sued afterwards.

332
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,380
(applause)

333
00:19:49,380 --> 00:20:57,330
You can 
dance along if you want.

334
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:11,340
(applause)

335
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,750
that was basically it.

336
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,140
But wait.

337
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:25,520
O no...

338
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,220
Well...

339
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,910
Yeah.

340
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,610
Yeah...

341
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,300
So...

342
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,690
Sorry, sorry.

343
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:47,070
So, thanks.

344
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,050
If you want to check the Semicolons, go to
the slide.

345
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,560
My brothers band, and the Glitch Mob and Broken
Haze.

346
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,680
Thank you!
