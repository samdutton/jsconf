00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,280

my name is Jacob just as Martha said and

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,000
today I'm going to present topic of

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,080
voxels rendering with JavaScript just a

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,910
short about me and just started George

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,710
Street like who in the December so

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,830
before I was a formerly Python developer

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,859
so that's my first attempt to ever to do

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,270
anything in 3d so just take take it into

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,610
account my twitter is Sasquatch or

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,110
Sasquatch and give counties rather empty

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,530
currently but I will place the cold

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,809
after my presentation and the street

13
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,410
does the blog also mainly about Python

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,510
currently but i'll try to fix that in

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,670
the coming weeks so why voxel octrees

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,500
well basically because of this guy

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,940
everybody knows the guy I believe John

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,360
Carmack the guy behind doom Wolfenstein

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,880
quake and the games like that so they've

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,479
got father of gaming okay and they're

21
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,030
just about two years ago John Carmack

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,670
said that we are currently reaching the

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,750
limits of the possibilities to render

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,880
simply render graphics using the

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,990
traditional methods so what are the

26
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,290
traditional methods well obviously

27
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,299
traditional methods are rendering using

28
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:36,299
polygons which are just a tiny triangles

29
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,940
and polygons are cool

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,260
because this hardware is optimized to

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,990
render using polygons also the polygons

32
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,410
are really nice big to show uniform

33
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,840
uniform surfaces but they suck at

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,660
complicated scene so a karmic decided to

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,970
go that bit different way and he

36
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,530
introduced voxels well nothing

37
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,780
introduced but he said he in the next

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,940
engine she's gonna render the scenes

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,000
using voxels and factories so forces are

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,760
just small cube so we just move the

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,060
pixel in 3d dimension trading a tiny

42
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,470
cube so you can get a better

43
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,870
representation of the of the scene there

44
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,070
are a lot of trouble with this technique

45
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,990
implementation is pretty straightforward

46
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,180
traversing the trees very easy

47
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,490
collisions are easy resolution change is

48
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,880
easy we have possibility generate sparse

49
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,540
voxel tree so the nodes of our tree that

50
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,310
don't contain data that need to be

51
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,630
rendered are just not shown it's really

52
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,930
easy to hide surfaces that we're not

53
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,110
showing there are many possibilities to

54
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,120
improve because the topic is not as much

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,850
research as the polygon generation but

56
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,239
there are a lot of cons so first thing

57
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,860
she can be expensive because if you move

58
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,620
if you start from the not from the

59
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,260
correct point you just can move back and

60
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,230
forth across the tree and this can be

61
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,860
really expensive and time-consuming

62
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,680
animations suck we'll just think about

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,640
moving 5 million or 50 millions of atoms

64
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,269
at a time across the tree structure it

65
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,910
really suck at the moment but will check

66
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,100
about that later and size doesn't matter

67
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,030
unfortunately storing data in an octree

68
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,220
44 voxel it's really sighs consuming so

69
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,870
let's proceed so first we dig into all

70
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,590
trees basically oak trees are just

71
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,750
trimmed with data presentation which

72
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,860
device divides the

73
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,540
the special into small box when each

74
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,940
book consists of eight children and so

75
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,870
on and so on and so on and this house

76
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,890
knows basically some pretty

77
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,380
straightforward I live third where you

78
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,340
can get it and how implemented it well

79
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,710
to be honest I just went through like

80
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,320
thousands of different codes to a lot of

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,240
different implementations in C in

82
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,640
JavaScript there is I believe only one

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,950
implementation JavaScript but I wasn't

84
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,049
able to contact the outer so I'm not

85
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,050
sure how it works he just states that it

86
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,030
does so old after that I went to check

87
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,010
the implementations of quad risk or

88
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,370
basically just the same idea but still I

89
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,110
wasn't able to find anything interesting

90
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,340
in there so after skimming through some

91
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,280
sickos C++ code I was able to come up

92
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,470
with a solution of my own solution which

93
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,010
is not over complicated and it worked so

94
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,580
basically that's the up three object as

95
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,729
you can see we have the node which is

96
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:58,260
the root of over over three structure

97
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,940
the road can't the root can contain

98
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,330
shape if you just have one level we have

99
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,840
also position over root we have also

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,800
type which is a bit not useful here okay

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,430
maybe it is the length of the wall which

102
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,190
gives us the size of the whole space and

103
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,169
the depth and the max depth which are

104
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,870
useful when traversing when adding and

105
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,260
etcetera etcetera so following now

106
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,630
denote the law basically is just the

107
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,340
same it differs with having nodes

108
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,290
reference which is a reference to an

109
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,680
array that contains the child node of

110
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,050
the root of the node which can be either

111
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,480
another note or can be

112
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,970
the stuff that will be rendering during

113
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,270
our scene and the data that will be

114
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,090
rendered I just stored in a flat array

115
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,860
because it faster to traverse roof run

116
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,950
away then going through the whole tree

117
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,530
it also has a parent reference because

118
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,630
it's faster to it give us really a boost

119
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,980
when the traversing girl Rory a location

120
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,330
which is the real magic here the real

121
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,420
deal okay now location I needed a way to

122
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,700
find my find the note i'm currently

123
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,310
dealing with and across the whole

124
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,220
structure and it had to be fixed because

125
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,410
basically we don't wanna guess in which

126
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,750
note we are so i went the bitwise like

127
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,000
idea where the note the the position of

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,580
the note inside the parent node it's

129
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,890
just defined by a difference on XY and z

130
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,010
axis so in all this further than half of

131
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,580
the length of XY or z axis we just said

132
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,490
to know set the beach one and if it's

133
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,800
closer to point zero zero just set the

134
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,890
bit to 0 0 to 0 and this gives us a

135
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,420
uniform distribution it's the same

136
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,590
across the hall the node so just the

137
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,270
ticket program now change the rest of

138
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,570
location magic I'm not really going into

139
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,040
the bit bitwise bitwise where it was bit

140
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,880
kinda start and so I decided to just set

141
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,890
the position and save the position as a

142
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,570
string as a triple of Charles so just

143
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,090
traversing deeper into the tree I just

144
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,480
add the current position

145
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,210
of my note inside the parental so just

146
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,920
as you can see in the no list for

147
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,520
example the first node in the in the

148
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,560
array then the second node we just start

149
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,380
with 0 0 0 and so on and so on we just

150
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,900
go deeper and deeper and deeper and

151
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,510
finally adding the the triples of

152
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,300
strings we just end with the correct

153
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,360
position of over note inside the whole

154
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,510
oak tree now some code for way it's not

155
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,790
maybe too obvious but I really try to

156
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,760
keep it simple mmm the recursive adding

157
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,130
of course we there are different

158
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,900
approaches but the recursion is the

159
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,560
easiest to just show you so we just

160
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
Traverse across we just Traverse across

161
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:31,479
the the oak tree we have to as you can

162
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,150
see here current location in our equal

163
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,070
string location and current depth is not

164
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,909
equal string depth so these are the two

165
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,330
the two operations that limit our as

166
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,040
approach the travas traversing so for

167
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,240
example 48 level 3 unless the current

168
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,500
location is equal to 8 times 3 / 111 we

169
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,600
just reverse deeper and deeper if the

170
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,670
current depth is not equal desired depth

171
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,910
you just go and add our node in the

172
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,780
correct way so how the function for

173
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,180
inserting looks like well it's pretty

174
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,500
straightforward we just divide the

175
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,940
string of location in two triples once

176
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,620
again and just following the idea I told

177
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,960
you about before we just select the

178
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,050
correct we just first okay with vesicles

179
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,380
we need to recalculate the position from

180
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,170
string to integer from bitwise to

181
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,579
integer then we can go through

182
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,279
the nodes selecting each node and we

183
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,799
when we down we just add node set the

184
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,009
values and that's all so the last

185
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:44,929
interesting function here is for

186
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:49,579
retrieving the node is we also reduce

187
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:52,670
recursion here and we can use make the

188
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,350
usage of the bit presentation so we just

189
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,579
calculate the boundaries of the note

190
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:00,829
we're currently in as well as the node

191
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:03,679
point or object we will be matching

192
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,850
against and if the x-axis if the

193
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,429
exposition keeps in the boundaries of

194
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:11,869
the note you're currently in we just

195
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:14,929
select the node and now we can use the

196
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:17,799
magic I told you about because if the

197
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,529
position of if the position of the

198
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,209
object will matching against the node is

199
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,189
smaller than half of all the length of

200
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:31,519
for example 4 x-axis or y-axis or z axis

201
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,220
we just set the bit to 0 either way we

202
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,379
set it one and this way we can limit the

203
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,779
amount of the child nodes that we need

204
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,819
to traverse so I can really boost up the

205
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:46,149
search now for some real life usage I

206
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:49,279
will just show you two examples the

207
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,220
first one ray casting also I believe

208
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,949
that this graphic shows though we can we

209
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,589
just need to calculate the position on

210
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,509
the entrance and deposition on the exit

211
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:04,600
we just then we traverse across the ray

212
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,819
through our up three and we select only

213
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:09,379
the notes that were affected we just

214
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:11,959
skip the rest and we saw it the note

215
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,339
that were inside the first room and

216
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:18,499
that's basically all the second one is

217
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:20,869
collisions the simple bounding boxes

218
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:22,309
approach is the one I've told you about

219
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:25,069
the one that uses the function presented

220
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,459
earlier but the other one is a bit more

221
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:31,669
complicated so basing on the path that

222
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:35,149
our object already traversed if we if it

223
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:38,869
did we can predict the road it will

224
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:39,590
follow

225
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,910
calculate the bounding boxes of their of

226
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,450
this element fire raised from the edges

227
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,400
of the bounding box and this also

228
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,840
selects us just the space that will be

229
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,250
affected and the space that we need to

230
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,430
really take care of that's just a simple

231
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,580
demo I hope that it will work who's this

232
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,170
I frame is a bit more not cooperating to

233
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:12,270
be honest ok yeah ok so just that simple

234
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,880
collision on bounding boxes just move

235
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,310
here and wallow ok we have a collision

236
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:25,890
so pretty cool thanks ok nearly half of

237
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,620
the time ok so now fast vocals the voxel

238
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,200
are just I said previously just remove

239
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,420
pixel in three dimension we create a

240
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,150
little cube from it and basically this

241
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,040
that's what we create a word from the

242
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,200
usages of divorces well you might have

243
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,940
thought that they are not used at all

244
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,270
because the concepts that previously but

245
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,400
while they are we used them for example

246
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,380
for medicine for rendering to the images

247
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,420
as well as we use them the way they were

248
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,520
previously used in games I can play the

249
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,560
rounder the whole vaccine the whole beam

250
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,620
engine was created using voxels

251
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,940
unfortunately they had some problems

252
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,700
with efficiency of this engine I believe

253
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,220
in chromatin conquer and red alert games

254
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,780
the units in the game will create

255
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,990
diffusing voxels the outcast game the

256
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,790
whole map was rendered using voxel but

257
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,700
they were cheating a bit there is a game

258
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,650
called foxes time so a clone of

259
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,070
Wolfenstein pretty cool also the whole

260
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,720
world is created of voxels you can just

261
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,660
see it clearly here and just recently

262
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,960
there was a lot of noise about

263
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,000
technology called unlike the detailed

264
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,220
technology well they really didn't

265
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,820
really

266
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,800
released any official info about the

267
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,710
technology behind this the this demo but

268
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,930
not the creator of Minecraft and some

269
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,860
other smart guys stated and agreed that

270
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,870
they for sure might be using optrician

271
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,750
boxes because they're mentioning atoms

272
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,300
for the rendering of the role so Adam

273
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,720
and q PM does the same as well as the

274
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,640
the model shown in during the demo are

275
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,060
just all the same so that's easy to just

276
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,430
cut part of our oak tree and duplicate

277
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,760
it and so buddy that's it also yeah for

278
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,740
sure will you say it in quake 5 and do

279
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,170
for and whatever other implementation I

280
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,330
just found one implementation of voxels

281
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,340
using javascript which is the one

282
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,270
display here from the ipod on the roof

283
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,770
why we don't like it and why that's not

284
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,300
what i wanted to do well basically

285
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,700
that's not a 3d engine but two and a

286
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,440
half d we now have the freedom of

287
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,630
movement here you just can move oh sorry

288
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,710
as you can see you can just move in this

289
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,070
way also it uses height maps only it

290
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,800
doesn't really have a structure so you

291
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,290
cannot have overlapping pixels when

292
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,010
there is a free space between them so

293
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,870
well that's not all that's not what I

294
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,960
wanted to build mmm now show about my

295
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,880
engine is a 3 beta alpha alpha alpha

296
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,340
really I just can't even say how not

297
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,290
finished it is there's still a lot of

298
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,650
work to do but basically i'll be able to

299
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,990
show you just a working demo unit

300
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,250
pinhole camera type thanks Marcus

301
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,990
Pedersen fillet to the trader of origami

302
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,410
3d I use geometrics for calculating the

303
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,830
mastery separation i'm using quads

304
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,430
instead of triangles for rendering and

305
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,610
texturing because apparently drawing a

306
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,230
quad it just uses four moves and joined

307
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,700
quad during using triangles these five

308
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,350
moves so we just have one additional

309
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,790
three i used parts walks of trees so the

310
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,410
space that doesn't contain any data

311
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,910
needed for rendering you just removed

312
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,590
from the tree there is a back face

313
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,510
culling there is no ray casting so it

314
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,020
really affects the performance and still

315
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,000
a lot of things to be done so I believe

316
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,650
that somebody will help me after the

317
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,840
conference with finishing this whoa whoa

318
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,530
whoa sorry once again of course we need

319
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,050
some data to generate a word so I went

320
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,410
the noise generation way and i'm using

321
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,300
Perlin noise for this party noise for

322
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,930
the year hey Moreno is what is that it's

323
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,900
just a set of formulas mathematical

324
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,130
formulas that can power in I believed

325
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,980
invented in like 1980s and that's the

326
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,620
really smart guy because basically

327
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,950
everybody uses that even unwittingly and

328
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,680
guy got an oscar for tron special

329
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,560
effects yeah so that speak for itself

330
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,840
also the effect is used in Photoshop

331
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,880
route filter so probably some of you

332
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,320
have used it already he has a side that

333
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,150
describes step-by-step how the noise was

334
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,460
Heather knows how the noise is made and

335
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,100
how to implement it I believe in C so

336
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,930
probably maybe somebody will find it

337
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,300
useful basically does the noise i'm

338
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,450
generating so does the sample 256 for

339
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,520
256 so i can just generate him

340
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,120
differently shapow yeah i'm just using

341
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,600
some and the idea single rate and some

342
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,800
different calculations which is just to

343
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,210
fit it to my world generating engine I'm

344
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,200
well I was thinking about going the

345
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,000
going to Minecraft way when they just

346
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,720
generate few noises after one after each

347
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,390
other just plating the splitting the

348
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,370
whole generated noise into small pieces

349
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,200
taking this piece generating goes over

350
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,730
this piece and so on and so on and so on

351
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,230
and it gives them proper results but I

352
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,800
didn't either that's all how we do it we

353
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,590
just cremate create an image data array

354
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,720
the size of the canvas

355
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,200
it was x 4 of course because RGB na and

356
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,470
for each pixel we just now the RGB data

357
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,770
to adjust the RGB data to zero and use

358
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,500
paulinho's only to generate alpha and

359
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,210
because it just gives us a uniform

360
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,200
distribution and really it works

361
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,900
properly so then we just have this

362
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,360
moving a little bit read the data from

363
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,539
the creative image can cut the noise in

364
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,010
half because obviously we don't want the

365
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,080
we're not in Himalayas we don't want a

366
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,090
nice to be the size over the whole

367
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,360
generated world and then just render it

368
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,970
so how it looks rendered will basically

369
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,919
something like that it pretty simple

370
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,880
currently as you can see there it's well

371
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,940
it resembles some kind of world not sure

372
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,549
which and just okay with him who short

373
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:43,610
one so I have a demo of generate

374
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,350
probably noise a small sample because

375
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,090
the performance is really cool I think I

376
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,340
mean you really really really cool yes

377
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,140
as you can see have added some lighting

378
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,799
it's just a word from last day so it

379
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,340
basically you can see that it's working

380
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,990
hopefully I'll manage to just improve it

381
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,850
a bit and have it work better and now

382
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,580
the fun part we need to generate the

383
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,179
world but I just hope that my firefox

384
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:14,960
won't die 23 is time consuming and

385
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,580
really resource consuming and I will

386
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,130
just tell you in a second one as you can

387
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,929
see it almost dies yeah still

388
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:24,909
calculating yep yeah free me from here

389
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:27,350
why it takes so much time well basically

390
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:32,539
i'm generating a sample of 64 x 64 x 64

391
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,880
so you can calculate from how much boxer

392
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,539
we have in it I haven't yet implemented

393
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:41,960
any removal of the hidden of boxes that

394
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,409
are not seen so the amount of data that

395
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:47,030
needs to be rendered off as you can see

396
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,880
he just really really really big and you

397
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,549
can see the noise generated in

398
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,399
in the corner basically it resembles a

399
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:58,539
bit they think that is generated I will

400
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,580
just try to move it but I just said it's

401
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,139
really poor performance there is also a

402
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:07,389
zooming but i'm not sure if it's capable

403
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:11,379
of showing it maybe we'll open have 10

404
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:15,879
more minutes yeah well it resembles

405
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,799
minecraft a bit even the textures are

406
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,700
used from minecraft so just I just I

407
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,499
needed to really turn off the lighting

408
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:25,869
because the computer would die even that

409
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:29,559
it has four cores and well basically why

410
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,929
it's working this way why the

411
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,269
performance is so poor isn't closing all

412
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:40,749
the tabs Yuri time consuming oh come on

413
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:52,850
come on come on how do plane yeah thanks

414
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:59,100
I just really need to show my slides

415
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,679
again yeah everybody's in it now sorry

416
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,559
for that it's going to take so much time

417
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:17,400
oh come on Firefox

418
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,840
oh nothing strange happened i believe i

419
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,170
just turned the world upside down okay

420
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:30,160
let's put this really shouldn't happen

421
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,130
oh no no it should it should ease that's

422
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,080
how it went to work yeah I just need to

423
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,370
consume the time of it yeah cool work

424
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,330
okay I'm just believe that I have to

425
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:53,790
come on slides

426
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:00,320
okay sorry it just is yeah I just need

427
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,309
to buy a macbook I believe ok kill this

428
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:08,000
process yeah close the process yeah

429
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,650
Firefox is checking first version yeah

430
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,730
for sure

431
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,610
okay so if you can fix it okay so we're

432
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:26,960
the slides

433
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,460
why it's not working sorry for that

434
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,470
really you just couldn't get a bit bored

435
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,909
maybe I'll tell a joke on outdoor

436
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:40,700
cooking okay kkkk uh yeah so it was like

437
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,200
26 leaf

438
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,320
oh yeah basically we will hear yeah I

439
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,750
can trust trampoline yeah you have the

440
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,260
noise the noise possible improvements

441
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,200
why it's working so slow well mmm there

442
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,180
are a lot of a lot of things to be done

443
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,400
as I said earlier we can join smaller

444
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,910
boxes in big round so we just have

445
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,850
blessed data to draw we can for sure we

446
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,040
need to hide unseen boxes like surround

447
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,960
sound rounded by other voxels we can

448
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,840
draw the the whole images with image

449
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,030
data so just the way I used for

450
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,890
generating the noise we can use it the

451
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,400
opposite way we can create magnetically

452
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,090
quick we can create our image data array

453
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,230
but without knowing the RGB and this

454
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,720
gives us a boost off like four times so

455
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,450
it's really cool properly casting needs

456
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,820
to be implemented yeah and some other

457
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,920
maybe some other traversing algorithm as

458
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,490
well as well GL cause currently event

459
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,530
used with WebGL cause WebGL is cheating

460
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,810
and where is that basically with GL

461
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,750
opengl and other lip lips for graphics

462
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,540
just don't allow you to create websites

463
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,540
we just you're just forced to use

464
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,260
polygon so basically building a world of

465
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,670
voxels with wedgie is just building

466
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,890
world from polygon so you can implement

467
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,570
it easily I've tried to implementing it

468
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,460
using the fridge is so just

469
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,440
straightforward because even mr. dupe

470
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,380
created demo of building world of voxels

471
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,730
so it works and summarize were drawing

472
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,860
voxels is slow really it's slow

473
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,450
everybody says that it's too slow

474
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,950
animating a slow sizes an issue and it

475
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,660
really seems impossible right now well

476
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,180
John Carmack states that he was able to

477
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,590
animate like three million boxes but

478
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,480
nobody believes him so probably we

479
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,980
should wait for for him to finish his

480
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,560
engine but still how does the full quota

481
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,360
girl photo from i believe last last week

482
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,730
we have to just everybody said that

483
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,230
there is nothing faster than speed of

484
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,480
light well neutrino just proved that the

485
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,030
wrong

486
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,680
so maybe the same will work on fox cells

487
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,840
and we're just a bit more info you can

488
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,240
ask me about the boxes you can check the

489
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,310
gift wrap after the presentation you can

490
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,710
come to voxels blogspot com which is a

491
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,830
block of guys from Nvidia which use cuda

492
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,920
for rendering the proper voxel images

493
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,490
which work and you can also ask just

494
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,470
karmic how to do it but i'm not sure if

495
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,880
you'll tell you just a short demo how it

496
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:32,690
should be done i believe that okay so as

497
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,550
you can see as you will be able to see

498
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,140
yeah it's pretty cool so they have

499
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,250
potential for sure the world looks cool

500
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,760
so probably would if with some help from

501
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,580
you guys or with some help from other

502
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,250
guys that will just go dig deeper into

503
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,200
this topic there will be a possibility

504
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,830
to create such things in in with

505
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:04,400
javascript and if I close that once

506
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,770
again you don't want to cooperate with

507
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:11,750
me okay just let's demo because you

508
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,630
obviously can go deeper into this topic

509
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,020
or just saying was all so

510
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,750
instead of going deeper into boxers you

511
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:37,330
can just not working

512
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,809
instead of going deeper into voltage you

513
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:42,450
can just play it for your March using

514
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:53,609
floppy music so thanks that's all

515
00:26:53,619 --> 00:27:01,509
questions if you have any issues no

516
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:06,589
chrome dies Oprah dies and Internet

517
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:08,929
Explorer doesn't really show the window

518
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:11,599
so I believe that Firefox is currently

519
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,789
the only the only browser capable of

520
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:15,429
displaying this data cause it's about

521
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,439
250 megabytes to show in one rendering

522
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:20,589
so the three a lot of data to be shown

523
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:25,969
does it does it does the problem great
