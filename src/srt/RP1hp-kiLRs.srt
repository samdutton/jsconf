something called impostor syndrome and

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,320
offer some hacks that you may be able to

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,640
use if you have the same struggle I am a

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,129
software developer and I work remote

8
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:42,469
from my home office for the company

9
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:44,960

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,629
developers of all levels find me if you

11
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:53,210
are interested in learning more so

12
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,550
working remotely I get to spend a lot of

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,399
time with my family and as you can see

14
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm a dad I love being a dad there are a

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,039
lot of you know struggles I had at first

16
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:07,940
with being a dad gosh I've never been it

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,509
I've never you know dogs cats right but

18
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:13,789
another human am I going to be able to

19
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:18,320
do that take care of that like I said

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,860
this is Jackson um he's the one without

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,509
the beard and he loves Christmas and all

22
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:30,439
the decorations and you know as a dad I

23
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,390
want to want to do the right thing I

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,400
want to you know set him up for success

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,950
I wanted him to see me very successful

26
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,140
earlier this week my wife asked me to

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,180
set up some yard decorations for

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,189
Christmas they happen to be of the

29
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,869
inflatable kind and if you've ever

30
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,640
worked with those I have a lot of you

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,200
know tethers usually to keep the wind

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,509
from blowing them from side to side and

33
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,860
away and not only did she ask me to do

34
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,270
that she asked me to do it during lunch

35
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:09,170
and I normally have like stuff right I'm

36
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,780
it's like I really want to do what I

37
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,850
want to do and and she said well you

38
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,410
know he would really love it if you did

39
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,510
it before he came home from school like

40
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,730
he goes to a mother's day out and there

41
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,470
was like 45 minutes left and so I'm like

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,060
oh gosh ok so there's you know it's a

43
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,540
deadline

44
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,129
and it's it's pressure because there's

45
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,590
expectations and you know I'm like oh

46
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,489
gosh so okay so I get the box and unpack

47
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,709
it and you know the inflatable part it's

48
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,260
pretty much one piece there's this ball

49
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,459
of light tethers and it's a ball and it

50
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,799
looks so like just nestled together

51
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,720
right and it's like oh yeah okay I can

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,970
just gently pull that apart and then

53
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,530
I've got four tethers and I can go on

54
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:55,389
with my day this is 10 minutes into it I

55
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:57,620
had a lot of thoughts going through this

56
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,120
and I'm like gosh you know I've got

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,549
stuff to do I I can't what if this is

58
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,889
take takes hours like I'm not a not

59
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:06,349
expert I mean good grief and why do we

60
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,230
even have inflatables and who cares if

61
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,579
it gets blown away right I i was able to

62
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,530
that's a poor picture but I was able to

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,590
get all four of them out and and then I

64
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,620
got to this moment success right you

65
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,700
know what success when you have an

66
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,310
inflatable 6-foot dachshund Santa in

67
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,310
your front yard right and got me to

68
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,370
thinking you know that golly man that's

69
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,290
the struggle i have with software i love

70
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,030
when i get the dachshund in the yard

71
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,940
right like I'd love that and you know

72
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,859
that's why I got into softwares I get

73
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,409
that feedback and you know solve

74
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:45,079
whatever it is and you know it's real

75
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,109
success and you know even more important

76
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:50,359
are like you know the project managers

77
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:54,199
and the bosses and the customers that

78
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,919
love that success my customer loved this

79
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,530
success you know as a dad I was like

80
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,979
yeah God you know this is awesome but

81
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:07,939
the journey to that was not as as rosy

82
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:11,599
as it should have been you see I'm an

83
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,030
expert I will stand here and tell you

84
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,760
I'm 100-percent expert I'm an expert at

85
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,459
eating I'm an expert at talking with my

86
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,940
hands and I'm an expert at believing

87
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,430
that I can without a full understanding

88
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,849
of a problem or possible solutions I

89
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:33,770
will go through a thought process where

90
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,950
I talked myself out of whatever sick

91
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,020
Tess I could have what's crazy is that

92
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,220
some cases I've solved in a million

93
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,730
times in other forms but i'll still try

94
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,010
to convince myself that I can't do it

95
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,110
there's too many challenges so why even

96
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:58,040
begin right so really yeah this is this

97
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,000
is a real thing and it's called imposter

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,230
syndrome with impostor syndrome you can

99
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,380
just simply feel inadequate when in

100
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,780
actuality you're perfectly qualified for

101
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,140
the task at hand it'll make you think

102
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,490
you're unable to go a single step

103
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,840
further it's literally doubt that will

104
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,550
just manifest itself in a lot of

105
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,030
different situations like to talk about

106
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,680
a few of those that relate to our

107
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,730
industry so we are knowledge workers a

108
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,930
hundred years ago it wasn't knowledge

109
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,520
work it was you know assembly lines and

110
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,310
now everything has changed in our

111
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,860
industry with software the pace has

112
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,760
absolutely changed in some cases we're

113
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,200
not able to keep up with everything

114
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,970
that's coming out with frameworks with

115
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,550
databases with networks with protocols

116
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,750
and on top of that newcomers are

117
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,650
constantly in fear what they don't know

118
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,110
right and even how to learn what's next

119
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,550
like you know they're not even thinking

120
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,820
about the the task at hand it's what's

121
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,440
happening what am I going to miss or

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,700
what do I don't know about what does

123
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,490
someone you know think of me there's

124
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,140
often thoughts of you know what if they

125
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,020
find out I don't know how to fix this

126
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,610
I've had that a thousand times over my

127
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,610
career and what if I can't fix this Wow

128
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:44,100
does that mean I'll lose my job

129
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,370
software is made up of a lot of basic

130
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,569
things computing numbers formatting text

131
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:52,270
communicating over networks these days

132
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:58,009
it's really complex we have a formal

133
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,990
separation these days of front end

134
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,870
versus back end and what's interesting

135
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,080
is that if you ask a back-end developer

136
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,310
to help out with something on the front

137
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,219
end you often get a lot of reluctance to

138
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:15,379
say hey you know I at CSS I don't know

139
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,419
about that but the whole time this guy

140
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:19,250
is maintaining or you know this person

141
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,090
is maintaining a ton of protocols and

142
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,659
databases and etc right and on the flip

143
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,779
side the front-end developers you know

144
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,919
there's this huge fear that they'll take

145
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,419
the site down you know and you're just

146
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,250
like hey can you just write this

147
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,710
function we're sales people if you don't

148
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,139
know that we have to sell ourselves on a

149
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,400
technology right and then we end up

150
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,370
having to sell each other on why this is

151
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,750
the right way to do it management it's

152
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,180
hard right you have to have to figure

153
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,149
out what what's the way to sell it right

154
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:00,710
and then there are all these thoughts of

155
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,560
what if what if something I suggest

156
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,849
doesn't work right is it is it me will

157
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:09,830
they blame me like is there actual blame

158
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,669
if this doesn't go the way they said it

159
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:21,110
was again will I get fired right I've

160
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,909
spent a career building software for a

161
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:25,339
lot of companies and every now and then

162
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,830
I'll have an idea something for me that

163
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,460
solves my own problem and I'm absolutely

164
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,079
the worst at implementing those I when

165
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:40,010
we were we moved about six years ago and

166
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,349
we're looking for houses and I couldn't

167
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,040
find a tool that helped me keep up with

168
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,410
the houses we'd seen online the houses

169
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,140
we had visited and we either liked or

170
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,600
disliked and then of course we had

171
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,620
family that was

172
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,270
always asking what about where what have

173
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,670
you seen what do you know all these just

174
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,339
inputs that are coming right and it's

175
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:05,140
like I can't keep up with that so let me

176
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,000
build a tool and I built this real

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,070
hackish tool that did some web scraping

178
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,339
and you know pulled images from an MLS

179
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,860
database but it gave like one page for

180
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,190
everyone to like see and the feedback

181
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,230
from family was awesome and I started

182
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,250
sharing it with friends and they're like

183
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,510
oh man you should totally build that

184
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,670
it's awesome I need that i can use an

185
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,770
apartment hunting it's awesome yeah it's

186
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,640
awesome it's all my need you know I

187
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,800
talked myself out of ever building that

188
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,260
before I would say before I've written

189
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,670
the first line of code but i have

190
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,760
several versions of this one version in

191
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,890
Perl another version in JavaScript you

192
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,930
know I could see things like the

193
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,240
TechCrunch article that would do you

194
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,420
know like say why this failed right you

195
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,770
know because i didn't use this library

196
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,570
like that that was it that was the

197
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,220
reason and techCrunch's the authority

198
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,510
and they knew that and that's the reason

199
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,430
that you know i can see that so I just

200
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,540
shouldn't even do it done right so

201
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,980
that's the setup for impostor syndrome

202
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,870
there's all these thoughts and all these

203
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,220
different areas i picked a few of them

204
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,240
and you know i want to share like how

205
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,110
I've been able to hack this by no means

206
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,420
and expert it at this ideas I have to

207
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,100
present but because this this week an

208
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,240
imposter syndrome reared its head I'm

209
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,100
overly qualified for this talk and

210
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,970
preparing it I man I felt like an

211
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,850
imposter but overall it's about proving

212
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,779
to yourself what you already know being

213
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:47,980
confident not cocky about your abilities

214
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,470
is a hundred percent healthy it just

215
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,810
simply sets you up so that you know what

216
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,339
you bring to the table an impostor

217
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,620
syndrome you know we all know hacking

218
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,120
software and how to kind of go around

219
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,520
things with different protocols or

220
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,790
you route around a function or something

221
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,230
right so I try to recognize that

222
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,160
imposter syndrome is a lie I am lying to

223
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,410
myself and I tried to realize that I'm

224
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,150
in that thought process and where its

225
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:28,180
leading and then I stopped it's pretty

226
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,710
easy to train yourself to recognize

227
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,550
something I have a another thing that

228
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,970
happens to me periodically throughout a

229
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,240
year on a friday i'll be working on a

230
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,100
problem and i'm not able to i'm not able

231
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,450
to solve it but i don't want to put it

232
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,730
down that's the pattern and once I

233
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,920
started to realize it that I'm in that I

234
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,350
say you know what I need to put this

235
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,470
down because that's the solution it's

236
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,870
like I don't want to put this down and

237
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,820
so I have this battle and what's crazy

238
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,760
is every time I put that down I saw it

239
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,100
in like 30 minutes on Monday so awesome

240
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,070
but the whole time I'm telling myself

241
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,790
I'm not going to be able to solve it so

242
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,340
just simply recognize that you're in

243
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,710
this thought process of you know I can't

244
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,270
do this they're not going to believe it

245
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,730
no one's going to buy it and then start

246
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,530
to seek first to understand so I'm a

247
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,890
huge fan of a tool called ansible that's

248
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,470
in the DevOps community and it will

249
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,310
allow you to deploy servers and it does

250
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,680
it literally over an ssh connection one

251
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,470
of the opening screens has a little

252
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,690
message that spoke to me when i first

253
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,430
saw it it's just called gathering facts

254
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,570
so you point it at a linux box and it

255
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,300
starts gathering facts I thought man

256
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,790
that's awesome you know in these

257
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,230
situations where I'm feeling like an

258
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,640
imposter I just need to start gathering

259
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,520
facts right knowledge is power

260
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,380
it's totally okay to not know what

261
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,690
you're doing right ansible had no idea

262
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,890
what's on the other end of that so it

263
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,380
starts to to get input the system name

264
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,700
the time etc starts to take an inventory

265
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,640
of what you know it's okay you don't

266
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,530
like I say you don't have to be cocky

267
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,020
it's just confidence build up your

268
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,210
confidence in what you know I know how

269
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,940
to write with a pencil I know how to you

270
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:41,940
know put on my shoes proof right

271
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,030
functional programming is pretty awesome

272
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,820
if you've not played with or looked into

273
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,470
functional programming I encourage you

274
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,280
to do that not only for a way you can

275
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,330
kind of use that concept to hack

276
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,670
impostor syndrome but it's really

277
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,320
awesome with a function you receive

278
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,320
inputs so these in the impostor syndrome

279
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,480
world they can be facts or concepts and

280
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,910
then you can you transfer you make a

281
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,910
transformation and you you output

282
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,170
something that output should likely be

283
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,010
learning right something you've learned

284
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,960
it's just an idea to take something that

285
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,270
we know in our code world and bring it

286
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:29,170
into our thought process and

287
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,360
immutability is is another concept that

288
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,930
may help in this area it's helped me

289
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,220
earlier this year I started using

290
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,460
immutable Jas and I found a lot of

291
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,700
comfort in the fact that I could have a

292
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,310
mutation to an object or something and I

293
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,590
can compare it and it's all good right I

294
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,760
don't have to worry about that thing

295
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,520
anymore so you know in relation to you

296
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,930
too imposter syndrome I I carry along

297
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,570
like debugging sessions that take weeks

298
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,450
and days and hours and you know don't

299
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,490
carry that along just because this bug

300
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,950
two years ago took you days and weeks

301
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,090
you know to trace through a system it

302
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,320
doesn't mean that all and will take that

303
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,510
right just that is one thing it's

304
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,080
completely unrelated to what you're

305
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,660
doing right now

306
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,670
and I'm a huge fan I work on the front

307
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,619
end these days I'm a huge fan of Redux

308
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:31,249
and hot loader react hot load or time

309
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:36,290
travel that Dan abramov brought to Redux

310
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,549
from a language called Elm if you've not

311
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:43,040
seen that I encourage you to to find out

312
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,809
on youtube and look at the front end

313
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,720
debugging process but what's cool is if

314
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,839
you think about things in a mutable like

315
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:53,119
as a single state right you carry a

316
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,399
state along with these immutable objects

317
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,839
and you can replay history so if you

318
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,489
start batching things up and say you

319
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:04,489
know what yes two years ago this this

320
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:06,589
situation took us some lint you know

321
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:09,939
trace it through all the ops stuff and

322
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:13,459
it's okay right that was then we've got

323
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:15,799
a different stack now we have different

324
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,350
people I have learned a lot more since

325
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,889
then right just um just an encouragement

326
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:27,470
to kind of replay in history I have to

327
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,220
take this to heart like I constantly

328
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,839
will get my twitter feed and oh my gosh

329
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,610
they shipped one point oh that and I've

330
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,709
not shipped a single thing right they

331
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:47,460
got funding wow you know that's awesome

332
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,209
but the success of others is not a

333
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,290
failure of yours I mean wow that's like

334
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,369
it hit me one day that it's so it

335
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:00,519
doesn't mean I didn't do something right

336
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,439
one of the times i happened to be

337
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,449
holding my son and i was scrolling

338
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,250
through twitter right feeding him a

339
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,600
bottle and someone had shipped something

340
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,760
i had that feeling but guess what i'm

341
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,919
taking care of a human it's okay you

342
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:20,380
know i mean literally focus i lose sight

343
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,549
obviously when i'm in a thought process

344
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:26,240
of i'm an imposter and focus on the

345
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,010
value you bring to the situation right

346
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,840
that goes back to the inventory and just

347
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,040
build great software

348
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,200
if you're in a business it's okay to

349
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,690
know your market and the advantage that

350
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,420
your business has but just forget

351
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:49,180
everything else it's all noise I use

352
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,000
them as my editor and I'm proud to say

353
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,470
that I've used it for almost 15 years

354
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,730
there may be Emacs guys in the back

355
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:03,310
uh-uh but that's what I know I am able

356
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,810
to do everything with that editor I love

357
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,080
what all the editors that continue to

358
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,400
push the the web and space forward I

359
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,860
love what they bring and I love what I'm

360
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,750
able to bring back into my editor but

361
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,400
that solves my problem and I'm

362
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,040
completely confident in the head it's

363
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,710
okay and I really only switched to a new

364
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,570
language or a database or a protocol

365
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,420
when it makes absolute sense that the

366
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,220
course I'm going is is wrong I'd also

367
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,350
encourage if you're not using any sort

368
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,780
of testing tool to set something up it

369
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,790
doesn't matter what it is it'll just

370
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,200
simply give you a little bit of

371
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,080
confidence in a certain area that this

372
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,930
piece works it may be a function but

373
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:58,030
that's huge I think we lose focus about

374
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,660
scaling right gosh if we could just

375
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,450
scale to one before we're worrying about

376
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,200
a million it would change a lot of this

377
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,160
the way we develop things and also how

378
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,040
we beat ourselves up I think or at least

379
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,680
myself when you learn to program you

380
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,660
start with you know printing hello world

381
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,700
and you take that and you put it into a

382
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,400
file and it's procedural and you take

383
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,350
that and you break it up into functions

384
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,680
and you take that and you put it into

385
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,560
objects and then there's the war between

386
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,120
object oriented and functional

387
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,600
programming and yeah yeah but it's you

388
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,640
had to scale to one before you got to

389
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,240
something bigger and then as soon as

390
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,210
you're able to scale to one ship it one

391
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,320
line of code is enough to ship

392
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,630
and your customer that saw the

393
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,299
inflatable dachshund will do their their

394
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,480
jump in the air as soon as you ship get

395
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,090
feedback I took my advice yesterday as i

396
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,799
was putting this together impostor

397
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,690
syndrome was rearing its ugly head I

398
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,830
reached out to some friends that I

399
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,279
trusted and they they gave me a

400
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,600
extremely valuable feedback and how I

401
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,220
put this together and they offered

402
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,429
constructive criticism and feedback will

403
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:28,460
get get you out of your head that's

404
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,279
exactly where you need to be and it will

405
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,830
shift your perspective on the problem as

406
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:40,340
well as the solutions you have to talk

407
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,820
to people I heard a quote recently and

408
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,480
I'm I can't credit to someone but

409
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:54,860
software's about people I am an

410
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,289
introvert and I like to go and get with

411
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,340
my code and work on that problem and

412
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,419
come up for meetings when I have a

413
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,700
chance but there are other days that I

414
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,440
have to force myself into realizing hey

415
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,649
this this team dynamic and these people

416
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:12,200
are here to help me and reason about the

417
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,389
problem in the solutions just realize

418
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:18,590
that they have this from the same

419
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,509
struggle that you do with whatever it is

420
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:25,039
you're working on with code and how it's

421
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,870
deployed in the projects everything's

422
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,809
different but we all struggle with

423
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:32,240
different things make sure to ask how

424
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,950
they've navigated certain situations

425
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,019
that you might be facing right now or

426
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:37,789
you faced in the past it's always good

427
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:40,279
to get a different perspective on the on

428
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,980
the idea if you don't attend a local

429
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,049
user group do so because that can help

430
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:49,340
with these conversations and then

431
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,460
realize that you're not talking apples

432
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,850
to apples right what's a scaling issue

433
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,830
to you is not a scaling issue to them

434
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,510
and how this utility performs for them

435
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,860
isn't always how it's going to perform

436
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,390
for you this hit home for me with

437
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,680
testing and an episode of note up that

438
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,300
was I believe put out in the fall last

439
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,680
year and it was really eye opening

440
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,440
because I just had this perception that

441
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,710
everyone had testing right and it all

442
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,780
just worked for them and you know I'm

443
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,330
and because of this old busted stack I

444
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,870
can't I can't test or I'm never going to

445
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,380
be there our tests take hours to run but

446
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,510
if you talk to a lot of developers yeah

447
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,820
some you can even take days to run right

448
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,920
that we've got legacy systems and we're

449
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,610
bringing them along and what was

450
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,990
interesting about this episode is that

451
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,200
as I listened to it I realized that my

452
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,310
stack was integration you know the

453
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,230
people that were in that were on this

454
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,080
panel were all talking about unit tests

455
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,590
and it was apples to oranges and I was

456
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,060
like wow so we're not talking the same

457
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,050
thing right they can unit test I need to

458
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,210
integration test so that's it that's

459
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,520
that was it but up until then I felt

460
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,610
like an imposter about testing and my

461
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,950
test set up that I have carried along in

462
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,240
that particular project and as you're

463
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,600
talking so um share what you know it may

464
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,120
not be you may not think it's a ton but

465
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,830
to the other person it may be huge I

466
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,240
think pair programming is absolutely

467
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,080
amazing for this in the pairs that i

468
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,980
have been a part of I can't think of a

469
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,710
single time where we didn't come away

470
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,790
with something that the other person

471
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,250
learned and it i like to call it

472
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,160
shoulder surfing but i will pick up on

473
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,690
something that someone's doing and I'm

474
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,220
like how did you do that or what are you

475
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,930
using and it may be something completely

476
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,150
unrelated to what we're doing but if we

477
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,600
never had that that interaction I I

478
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,030
would have never said hey can you show

479
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,870
me how you toggle this key right

480
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,919
ironically it see it comes

481
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,100
two times when most of those are when I

482
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,960
pair with a friend of mine that uses

483
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,220
them and he will show me something and

484
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,899
it turns out what plug-in are you using

485
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:27,609
that's awesome when was it released and

486
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:30,489
its core to them and it has been since

487
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:36,279
like 1995 so that's fair but it sharing

488
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,929
what you know will build confidence in

489
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:39,669
your abilities and it will also help

490
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:43,570
someone so it's win-win make sure to get

491
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,809
comfortable saying this and then follow

492
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:50,230
it up with outout I'll find out just

493
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,730
approach each situation with something

494
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,989
you know and then something you'll learn

495
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:58,570
and you'll be okay there are known

496
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,320
unknowns and there are unknown unknowns

497
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,070
these can be extremely crippling it's

498
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,619
okay that you don't know everything

499
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:11,529
about the stack just know your piece and

500
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:18,309
trust others to know there's finally

501
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:21,909
just a note to be kind be kind to

502
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:24,909
yourself and be kind to others when

503
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:26,619
we're at a conference like this a lot of

504
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:31,149
people are learning and it's not okay to

505
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:34,450
not include them in a conversation

506
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,639
because they don't know as an impostor

507
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:41,889
I'll walk into a conversation and

508
00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:43,029
they're talking about something that I

509
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:46,119
don't use so I'll instantly count myself

510
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,840
is not qualified to participate i

511
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,889
encourage you to bring people into the

512
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:53,320
fold if you see them not participating

513
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,980
and give them that comfort we have

514
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,659
complicated stacks and there's just a

515
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:01,299
lot of disruption going on with the

516
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,159
technologies and with how we're gluing

517
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:05,139
them together so just don't beat

518
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:09,480
yourself up so that's my story and and

519
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,029
the hacks feel free to find me this

520
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,609
weekend or reach out to me on twitter

521
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:18,249
keep the conversation going and let me

522
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:21,669
know if i can help you let me know what

523
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:26,150
works for you thank you
