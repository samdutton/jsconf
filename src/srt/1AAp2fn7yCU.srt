00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,670
hello everyone do you know that feeling

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,980
where you spent months handcrafting a

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,220
webpage and then you test it and then

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,140
you deploy it and as soon as somebody

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,140
visited some link is broken something is

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,019
missing I know that feeling and if you

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,519
do as well then I have a tool for you

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,390
which I built

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,560
it's called hyperlink so I can show you

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,600
how I would test my own blog here and do

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,210
it recursively I need to type in the URL

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,719
correctly this will go on and crawl my

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,610
entire website and tell me all about

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,950
whatever what errors I might have which

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,870
links might be broken which links might

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,750
be leading to permanent redirect and I

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,579
should probably update it it will check

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,770
fragment identifiers if they're correct

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,250
and everything it's outputting tap which

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,079
is supposed to be machine readable not

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,090
human readable so you can take the

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,439
output and pipe it into a reporter for

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,490
example tap spot and it'll tell you that

25
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,350
you have these errors you're linking to

26
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,009
LinkedIn which is responding HTTP 9 9 9

27
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,930
this is basically because LinkedIn does

28
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,380
not like to be scraped I'm linking to a

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,590
meetup page which has a broken 404 and

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm linking to something on Jenkins

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,420
which has a 403 because they don't like

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,420
to be scraped either you can run this on

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,180
local files you can run it on remote

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,720
HTTP URLs and get this output and it

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,090
fails correctly on the command line so

36
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,770
if you want to tie this into your CI

37
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,950
integration system you can do that and

38
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,649
it's available on NPM NPM install hyper

39
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,560
link and the command line help is

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,020
hopefully useful otherwise there is a

41
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,610
readme thank you

42
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,280
