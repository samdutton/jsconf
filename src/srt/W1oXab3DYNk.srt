00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,519

so my name is Sebastian mark page I live

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,900
in San Francisco

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,180
for facebook on the reactor core team

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,610
here in Buenos Aires I really like the

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,079
city weather is beautiful beautiful city

6
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,040
looks like a combination of every other

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,300
city like Tokyo Paris London modern New

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,230
York yeah I went to the cemetery just

9
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,350
because I had to see that it's pretty

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,869
cool place spooky right around the

11
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:54,510
corner from here so my talk was about

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,839
how we a dog polyfills as a way to adopt

13
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:02,409
new language features before these

14
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,960
standards even finalized before it's

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,170
implemented in browsers so that we as a

16
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,130
community can unify on a single set of

17
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,869
tools instead of with diverging

18
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:19,260
libraries I work on the

19
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,969
CC 39 standards committee that specifies

20
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,070
what the next version of the JavaScript

21
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,299
will look like and as part of that work

22
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,130
I'm really interested in getting

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,689
adoption as soon as possible because

24
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:37,960
that helps us at Facebook but also in

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,069
our open source community in 10 years I

26
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,310
think that JavaScript will be going in

27
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,929
is stronger I think that we will

28
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:49,299
actually have shifted patterns lot we

29
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:52,770
will no longer be using as much

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,289
object-oriented styles will probably use

31
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:59,140
the less mutation we will move towards

32
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,829
more of a functional style paradigm and

33
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,750
we will start dropping

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,300
features from the language that people

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,630
will no longer use as they're adopting

36
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,870
new patterns this conference is really

37
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,210
it's really nice it's really big it's

38
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,280
one of the biggest J's comp events out

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,950
there and really happy to be here the

40
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,170
camera has really gone all out and

41
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,480
trying to create the best experience
