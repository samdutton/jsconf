00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:13,059

my name is Nick Elizabeth wanta and i

2
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:15,699
work at twitter for the visual insights

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:20,560
team so we do data visualization focused

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,539
mainly on public tasting events i leave

5
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,439
the interactivity telecom project and

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,169
yeah so i was born in argentina i study

7
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:31,750
in argentina until I was like about 23

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,030
24 years old and then I moved to France

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,539
I worked there for about three years for

10
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,579
a French search engine company and then

11
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,100
I moved over to the u.s. to work for

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,750
Twitter

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,880
currently I'm working I've been working

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,550
with Twitter like for more than two and

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,640
a half years

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,140
yeah April 2415 will be three years so

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,140
my talk was about from data journalism

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,940
to data illustration so it's like how to

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,120
visualize data using javascript and how

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,129
we do that at Twitter so it's like the

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,300
process of like building data

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,920
visualisations for different verticals

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,830
so we build data resulting to produce

24
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,930
government TV and sports and other

25
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,300
verticals it's like how we build those

26
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,180
visualizations yeah so i've been using

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,970
web standard sims i graduated basically

28
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,700
so for more than seven or eight years

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,270
now mostly using standards for graphics

30
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,220
so i am very interested in graphics

31
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,160
technologies in general so it's like 2d

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,220
canvas SVG and WebGL are the main three

33
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,289
main graphic standards and i'm using

34
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,840
those to create data to those agents to

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,759
give you some kind of data points like

36
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,830
there are a billion tweets every two

37
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,970
days so it is a huge challenge to try to

38
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,399
visualize that and also you know all the

39
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,500
important features of our platform that

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,840
we're global for real time we're

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,100
conversational so there are a lot of

42
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,650
different aspects that presenter of

43
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,990
challenges to visualize data

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,240
yeah around public facing events for me

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,030
so for our team right so it's like the

46
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,370
Oscars it's like a huge event there are

47
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,220
a lots of tweets you know state of the

48
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,960
union address there's a lot of

49
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
conversation around what the president

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,890
says and a lot of things like that so

51
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,840
yeah I think that it's already something

52
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
that could be in the future like if you

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,050
had a platform that's already real-time

54
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,790
and you know how people are using

55
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,380
Twitter they're using it in very

56
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,750
different ways and so it's it's

57
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,100
interesting to try to know more about

58
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,260
the user base and how they're using it

59
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,570
like we're providing them a platform and

60
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,130
they're building something on top of

61
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,770
that right so it's I can really tell how

62
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,250
it will be 10 years from now this

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,880
conference is amazing the caliber of the

64
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,360
speakers like here are great we have

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,860
Brendan Eich who's like the creator of

66
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,170
JavaScript we will be talking today so

67
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,390
that's like that doesn't get better than

68
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,880
that right and the community is huge

69
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,730
it's like I've been here in 2012 it was

70
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,160
about 200 people and now it's like three

71
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,160
times more that three times 3x that so

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,440
it's it's really big it's getting bigger

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,000
and yeah I've been talking to a lot of

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,340
different people from Buenos Aires from

75
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,730
La Plata and there

76
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,010
like there's a huge kind of movement

77
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,870
around like technology in general in
