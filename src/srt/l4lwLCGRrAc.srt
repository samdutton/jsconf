00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,789

[Applause]

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:07,440
well hips all right

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,349
so yes I work on web standards at Adobe

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,480
I am co-chair of the CSS working group

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,500
but last week it was my other co-chair

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,789
who managed to get riding modes resolved

7
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,160
to go to propose recommendations so I

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,939
don't get to claim much for that one I'm

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,000
going to talk to you today about how all

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,020
of you can help getting browser bugs

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,850
fast I'm going to start with a little

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,510
bit of audience participation everybody

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,610
here does some kind of web development

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,219
how many people here raise your hand if

15
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,870
you have run into a browser bug so many

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,590
bugs all right of all you people which

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,090
is almost everybody who has run into a

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,010
browser bug how many people have

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,690
actually reported the bug that you found

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,239
that's about what I usually see maybe

21
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,330
10% yeah I'm hoping by the time I end

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,560
this presentation more people will feel

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,600
empowered to log browser bugs help them

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,259
nudge them along the way to being fixed

25
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,080
and I'm gonna tell you about the things

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,240
that I've found have been effective at

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,280
getting browser developers to actually

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,720
do something for you so why should you

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,840
care you run into a browser bug you find

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,930
a solution and you go along your merry

31
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,439
way if you're anything like me you find

32
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,710
the bug you figure out a solution you go

33
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,250
along and sometime later months years

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,259
maybe even weeks you run into the same

35
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,149
bug again and you've forgotten what the

36
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,310
solution was and you have to go through

37
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,659
the effort of solving some of the else's

38
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,330
problem

39
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,780
again so yes you managed to get a

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,910
browser bug fixed that means there's one

41
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,410
less thing that you have to do you're

42
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,730
helping future you but it's not just

43
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,680
yourself you're also helping hundreds or

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,390
thousands and developers around the

45
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,310
world who will also run into this bug

46
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,170
maybe some other people in this room

47
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,300
will run into the same bug that you do

48
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,860
and if you all can manage to get the bug

49
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,140
fixed that's one less thing for other

50
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,640
developers to worry about but also a

51
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,660
more bug free web helps users of the web

52
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,210
a better environment for browsing is

53
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,270
better for everybody and the less bugs

54
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,640
there are the more that web developers

55
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,130
like yourselves can do things for your

56
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,010
users and getting a browser bug fixed

57
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,050
means that billions of people around the

58
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,540
world have a better time in their

59
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,989
browsers and I apologize I don't maybe I

60
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,690
need to shave my beard for presentations

61
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,239
the microphone always seems to rustle a

62
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,709
little bit and I'm sorry about that so

63
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,270
what can you do to fix about well

64
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,050
browsers are open source so your

65
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,000
developers you could go fix the bug

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,780
yourself it is possible I worked at a

67
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,239
team on Adobe that did this very thing

68
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,489
we fix bugs in lots of browsers we added

69
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,860
features to lots of browsers but it's

70
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,290
not really what I expect anybody to do

71
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,450
we no longer do it ourselves it wasn't

72
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,100
really a cost-effective thing we

73
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,080
couldn't really justify the expense of

74
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,360
having a team fixing bugs in browsers

75
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,060
because there are people where it's

76
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,770
their job to fix bugs

77
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,410
there are browser engineers funded in

78
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,860
some cases by companies that have lots

79
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,350
of money so they really should do their

80
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,630
job and

81
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,420
there are ways in which we as users of

82
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,000
the platform we as developers can help

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,940
them to nudge them along to fixing the

84
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,600
bugs that are the worst things in our

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,020
development life so what I'm going to

86
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,840
talk to you today about is how to

87
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,200
influence browser developers how to

88
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,080
nudge them along things that I found

89
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,500
effective both in my own life and in

90
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,450
what I hear from other people and

91
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,120
getting browser browser developers to

92
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,840
fix the bugs that are important the one

93
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,330
basic if nothing else just do this one

94
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,310
thing it's just make sure the bug is

95
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,850
reported there are a number of search

96
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,490
engines this is one of them that will

97
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,340
search through all of the bug bases for

98
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,080
all of the browser's all placed all the

99
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,270
major browsers and let you know whether

100
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,060
a bug has already been reported so at

101
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,740
the very least you can go and see

102
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,110
whether something needs to be done about

103
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,360
this rug if you find the bug that is

104
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,390
causing you trouble the easiest most

105
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,979
cost-effective thing you can do is just

106
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,280
a vote for it you might not think that

107
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,860
this would make much of a difference but

108
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,590
it actually does I've been in meetings

109
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,870
with browser developers talking about a

110
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,139
particular bug sometimes about that they

111
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:46,419
know has been around for a long time but

112
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:51,250
they've told me point-blank I can't get

113
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,990
anybody to fix this bug because it only

114
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,479
has ten votes and these other bugs over

115
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,820
here have 200 votes and so these are the

116
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,430
ones that I'm gonna actually spend some

117
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,810
time fixing so if you can find a bug

118
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,490
please and it's kind of causing you pain

119
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,280
please vote for it there's like a plus

120
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,820
one a favorite a follow in these bug

121
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,330
systems

122
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,059
that gives the browser developers some

123
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:20,729
sense of priority on what actually needs

124
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:23,519
to be fixed element platforms and it's

125
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,449
not just bugs new features are all

126
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,080
listed in these bug in these but

127
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,489
repositories has bugs so if say you were

128
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:40,889
interested in having paintwork let's be

129
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,110
implemented in more browsers you can go

130
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,519
to the browsers that don't implement

131
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,129
them and find a bug that says implement

132
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,409
paint worklet and vote for that bug and

133
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,889
that will help the browser engineers get

134
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,199
around to implementing pig worklets and

135
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,699
making them something that you can use

136
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,369
all over the web you can also put new

137
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:06,659
information in bug comments if you came

138
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,459
at the bug from a slightly different

139
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,479
direction putting new steps in is a

140
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,759
really good thing to do the only thing

141
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,529
that you should not do in a bug comment

142
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:18,569
is actually just do a plus one because

143
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:20,789
the voting mechanisms are there for that

144
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,439
and if you can't find the bug just write

145
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,189
it up it can be a very quick thing or it

146
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:31,139
can be a very involved thing depending

147
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,610
on how much effort you want to put into

148
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,929
it

149
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:37,919
and don't worry about adding a duplicate

150
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,439
bug to these systems if you've made a

151
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,740
good-faith effort to find the bug and

152
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,699
you haven't found it

153
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,839
riding a bug and letting some browser

154
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,999
engineer do some triaging and say oh no

155
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,849
it's actually this mug over here is

156
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,249
perfectly fine and that just means that

157
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:58,019
the next person that goes and tries to

158
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,169
find the that bug with the search terms

159
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:02,819
that you used they'll find your

160
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,860
duplicate it'll link to the actual bug

161
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,829
and so in some cases like this

162
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:11,570
duplicates are a fine and good thing

163
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,490
so you've gone and logged a bug or you

164
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,740
found the bug and you voted on it so

165
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,740
you're done right all bugs get fixed or

166
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,240
sometimes they just hang out forever and

167
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,540
get closed as one fixed after 20 years

168
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:38,090
of being around so there are some things

169
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,770
that you can do to improve your chances

170
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,030
of getting a bug fixed and they're

171
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,750
mainly just writing a good bug making

172
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,500
sure that the steps to the bug are the

173
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,210
smallest number of steps that can

174
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,820
possibly be quite a few bugs that

175
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,950
browser developers get from outside

176
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,780
their projects or load this URL and

177
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,110
things don't look good that's not much

178
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,860
to go on

179
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,790
so if you can reduce the thing that is

180
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,590
going wrong to just a few lines of code

181
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,740
and say here's what needs to be fixed to

182
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,890
make things better for me it's much more

183
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,590
likely that a browser engineer is going

184
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,200
to actually do something about it

185
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,870
you can add examples to a bug you can

186
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,190
show what the repercussions of the bug

187
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,040
are that will give the browser developer

188
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,300
more to go on when they go and have to

189
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,340
fight for spending time to fix a

190
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,250
particular bug and finally the most

191
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,800
effective thing that you can do is to is

192
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,070
to add a test case the browser developer

193
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,870
when they fix the bug they're going to

194
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,970
have to go add a test case or a set of

195
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,670
test cases themselves so you can do a

196
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,490
little bit of work to help the browser

197
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,620
developer and that'll make it more

198
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,500
likely that they'll actually get around

199
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,670
to fixing the bug for you

200
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,910
so I'm going to talk to you a little bit

201
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:15,499
about test cases ten years ago before I

202
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,240
got started in this web platform stuff

203
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,300
all of the browser's had their own test

204
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,290
sets that only ran on their own browser

205
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,360
and there was no sharing of tests and

206
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,309
over the last 10 years there's been this

207
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,860
thing that is now called the web

208
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,839
platform tests project that is a

209
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,620
repository of cross cross browser tests

210
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,689
that the browser's are now all sharing

211
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:50,389
and so if browser developer on Firefox

212
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,759
writes a cross browser test they can

213
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,309
upload it to web platform tests and that

214
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:57,800
test gets synced to all of the other

215
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,189
browsers that are sharing and so it's a

216
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:04,970
multiplier effect and somebody who

217
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,189
doesn't work on a browser can add a bug

218
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:10,879
to this repository and it will get moved

219
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,730
out to all of the browsers testing

220
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,319
environments and be tested in perpetuity

221
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:20,930
using some shared infrastructure that

222
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,660
they have been working on together and

223
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,879
the set of tests are run independently

224
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,819
and reported on every test there are

225
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,800
millions of these tests every test gets

226
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,649
run four times a day on all the major

227
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,079
browsers and the results get recorded

228
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,430
and so it's a second indicator for the

229
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,980
browser developer that something is

230
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,709
going wrong in their browser and it's a

231
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,829
second nudge towards fixing the thing

232
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:58,759
it's not only a failure in their own

233
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,220
test system it's a failure in this

234
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,980
external test system that they have to

235
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,620
look at and triage and decide whether or

236
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,420
not

237
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,350
bugs that have tests in this

238
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,070
cross-browser

239
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,550
test repository are much more likely to

240
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,470
be fixed especially over the last couple

241
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,800
years they've shown how the trajectory

242
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,550
of tests that run and pass in more than

243
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,690
one browser or in all browsers has been

244
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,400
increasing and the the velocity of these

245
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,140
tests working in more than one browser

246
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:42,130
has increased as this web platform tests

247
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,720
project has been going on so there is a

248
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,970
bunch of documentation at web platform

249
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,090
tests about how to contribute how to

250
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:57,080
write tests and there are a few formats

251
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,400
that they talk about and the two I want

252
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,390
to mention are test harness digest tests

253
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:09,080
they're basically unit tests and so if

254
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,090
you know any sort of unit testing

255
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,190
framework this is just a test in

256
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,490
JavaScript with assertions much like any

257
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,650
other unit testing framework if you

258
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,170
don't know what unit tests are go find

259
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,390
out they are one of the best things that

260
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,140
you can add to your own development but

261
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,370
I think most people know about them so

262
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,870
I'm not going to mention much about of

263
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,700
this except that this is one way that

264
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,020
you can add a test to web platform tests

265
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,850
the second one that I'm going to talk

266
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,540
about is ref tests which are a kind of

267
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,810
visual comparison test but they're

268
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,810
different from regular snapshot tests

269
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,020
that are actually just testing against

270
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,790
say an image that you've taken a

271
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,670
snapshot of a test result they're set up

272
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,880
a little differently and they're set up

273
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,990
such that

274
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,750
they can run across all browsers across

275
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,460
all environments across all say font

276
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:14,450
setups graphics setups and there's no

277
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,760
picture of the test result that you have

278
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,950
to maintain they're actually the only

279
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,870
snap choice tests that are actually

280
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,290
worth anything if you look at this

281
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,149
documentation there's a bunch of other

282
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:29,760
tests test formats that they mentioned

283
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,850
but you should ignore all of them

284
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:37,610
they're mainly just test formats that

285
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,170
the browser's used in their legacy

286
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,610
systems and nobody should ever write

287
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,279
them again test harness dot J's tests

288
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,459
and rec tests are the only way to go so

289
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,270
a little bit more about ref tests here's

290
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,240
how they're set out you have two files

291
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,010
that get rendered in a browser one file

292
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,850
has what they expect the tests to render

293
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,420
as and it doesn't use the feature under

294
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,660
test at all in a lot of cases it's just

295
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,940
a green box of our certain dimension and

296
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,709
then you have another file that actually

297
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,279
uses the thing that you're testing that

298
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,750
produces exactly the same rendering as

299
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,390
the reference and that can be a little

300
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,220
tricky to set up but sometimes it's

301
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,950
actually pretty easy and you have the

302
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,020
browser in a particular environment with

303
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,730
a particular font setup and all of this

304
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,730
rendered both files and then compare the

305
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,320
two against each other so there's

306
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,089
nothing to maintain

307
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,820
you're just rendering stuff doing the

308
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,250
pixel comparison and if the pixels match

309
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,570
the test is good so I want to show you a

310
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,110
simple ref test that I recently added to

311
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,440
web platform tests

312
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,310
the situation was there's a typography

313
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,300
slack I'm on

314
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,230
and one of the people there mentioned a

315
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,110
bug they were seeing in Firefox they had

316
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:17,040
a they had a JavaScript file that was

317
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,830
comparing the widths of various bits of

318
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,860
text and then doing fitted so he would

319
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,870
make the text bigger to fit a wider

320
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,640
thing or make the text smaller to fit a

321
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,240
smaller thing so you could measure in

322
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,870
JavaScript and get the text to fit the

323
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,940
environments you wanted it in and

324
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,900
Firefox was just giving bad nets for a

325
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,080
particular set of features first letter

326
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,730
and text transfer so I went and found

327
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,550
the bug for this it's about 10 years old

328
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,560
Firefox knows about the bug it's not

329
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,710
that important to fix so it's never

330
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,300
gotten fixed but I voted for it and got

331
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,730
my friend on slack to vote for it as

332
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,730
well and then since I had a talk to

333
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,520
prepare about testing I decided right a

334
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,420
ret test for it and let's see let me

335
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,200
show you

336
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:30,350
the test so here is the reference it's

337
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,020
got a green box it's got some text that

338
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,460
describes what you should see on the

339
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,680
screen that there should be no red

340
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,820
that's not actually necessary but it's a

341
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,280
style that people use for rep tests that

342
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,250
I kind of like and it's not using any of

343
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,320
the features that I want to test it's

344
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,250
not using first letter it's not using

345
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:58,460
text transfer and then I have the start

346
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,450
of the test that in season first letter

347
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,900
and is using text transform and

348
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,250
measuring the width in a visual way by

349
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:17,000
adding a background color and here is

350
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,140
the text reference in Firefox and the

351
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,820
test start in Firefox which on first

352
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,450
rendering does it that you can see

353
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,240
there's the extra bit in the red part

354
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,890
who knows why that width is actually

355
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,810
there so I'm going to be a coward and

356
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,650
not do any live coding I'm just going to

357
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,680
show you the complete test which is

358
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,590
adding a couple things I had those two

359
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,050
spans that were in line walks and I've

360
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,730
just said that their position happen

361
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,390
absolute so they will overlap and

362
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,730
actually I need to redo this because it

363
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,650
is only on first rendering that the bug

364
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,330
shows up

365
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,899
so the two things are overlapping and

366
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:11,809
I've made the text transparent because

367
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,029
the actual text rendering isn't part of

368
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,519
this bug it's just the width that we're

369
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:21,739
concerned about and on Chrome everything

370
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:22,159
looks great

371
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,779
there's no red because those two things

372
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,909
the test and control spans are exactly

373
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:32,239
the same width and in Firefox the red

374
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:35,749
pokes out so this is going to be a

375
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:42,139
failure for Firefox and so that's

376
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:42,739
basically it

377
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:45,080
- a rough test you have two files and

378
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,919
they have the same rendering and if you

379
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,480
were looking very very closely it's

380
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,940
probably hard to see the rendering is

381
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,279
actually different between browsers the

382
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,799
green box and Firefox is a little white

383
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,980
is a little taller and that just happens

384
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,279
to be because I have a default font that

385
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,950
is a little bit taller than the default

386
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,289
font that's used in Chrome but this

387
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:14,239
doesn't matter because we're comparing

388
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:15,980
chrome rendering to chrome rendering and

389
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,999
Firefox rendering to Firefox rendering

390
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:24,769
so I put this into web platform tests

391
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:31,549
and it's now being run four times a day

392
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:35,509
and you can see that the latest Firefox

393
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:39,440
that was tested is showing a failure so

394
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,230
there's now a test result that is

395
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,070
showing up four times a day for two

396
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,119
basically shame the Firefox engineers

397
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,480
into eventually fixing this bug

398
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:03,690
and hopefully they will get around to it

399
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,240
all right

400
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,100
so adding a test case is really the best

401
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,310
way to get some attention to the bug and

402
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,260
adding a test case to web platform tests

403
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,590
is a way of getting more people to look

404
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,950
at the problem and hopefully get

405
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,290
somebody to actually commit to the VIX

406
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,570
but another thing that you can do is

407
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,010
just to tell people about the problem

408
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,530
that you're running into my friend on

409
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,410
slack told everybody in the slack

410
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,530
Channel about this problem and I happen

411
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,110
to read it and do some extra work to

412
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,880
make it slightly more likely that this

413
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,980
bug is going to be fixed mentioned

414
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,830
people that you're updating or voting on

415
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,450
a bug maybe you'll get more people to

416
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,650
vote on it in solidarity and you can

417
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,510
show people the test case I showed the

418
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,940
test case to some people that I work

419
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,990
with in the CSS working group and they

420
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,880
showed me a few things to fix in it to

421
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,990
make it a little bit more bulletproof

422
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,210
the test that's actually in web platform

423
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,080
tests is a little bit more complicated

424
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,820
but I only got those improvements

425
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,460
because I told people about it and Here

426
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,330
I am today telling you about this bug

427
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,370
perhaps some of you will go take a look

428
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:35,540
at it and vote for yourselves

429
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,320
letting people know the problems that

430
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,040
you're running into letting people know

431
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,540
what it is that you've done to try to

432
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,110
fix the problem you can get better

433
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,580
solutions two things you can get people

434
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,010
talking about the problem and you can

435
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,470
get browser developers to notice

436
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,890
something's going wrong this is an

437
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,070
example from about a year ago there was

438
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,570
a developer who had a site that was

439
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,590
written great in all of the browsers and

440
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,150
he tested on Chrome Canary which is an

441
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,740
excellent thing to do you should take a

442
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,330
look at all the developer versions of

443
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,890
browsers and see how your site is

444
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,410
working in them to get some idea of what

445
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,530
is going to happen for your users in the

446
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,750
upcoming weeks and months and he found

447
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,990
that his site in Chrome Canary regular

448
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,670
chrome is fine but in Chrome Canary just

449
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,360
broke and so he wrote a bug saying you

450
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,640
know here's my code here's what's going

451
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,850
wrong why did you change this you're

452
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,250
making the web worse and he didn't have

453
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,730
to wait 20 years to have his bug closed

454
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,280
this won't fix almost immediately the

455
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,200
browser developer went and closed it as

456
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,050
won't fix because the spec said it was

457
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,390
supposed to be this the spec had changed

458
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,580
and so the chrome engineer was being

459
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,100
diligent and changed chrome to match the

460
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,059
spec so this guy of the developer said

461
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,730
no this is not good enough he looked at

462
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,290
the spec and found the email addresses

463
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,660
of the spec authors and said why did you

464
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,640
change the spec and it turns out the

465
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,740
spec change was bad they hadn't

466
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,050
considered this case and because of this

467
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,220
guy's diligence he fix the spec and

468
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,940
fixed Chrome Canary before the bug or

469
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,400
the spec conformance actually shipped in

470
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,570
the browser

471
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,740
here's another example from just a few

472
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,160
months ago this guy said you know hey

473
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,360
I'm running into this problem anybody

474
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,490
knows why this is going on and he got a

475
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,890
browser developer to reply saying well

476
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,210
it works for me what are you talking

477
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,280
about and they went back and forth for a

478
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,620
while came up with a jsfiddle that

479
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,720
actually demonstrated the problem and it

480
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,150
was an actual problem and just recently

481
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,059
this got fixed and it's going to be

482
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:05,690
fixed in mainline Firefox next month so

483
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,150
telling people about things letting

484
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,470
people know the problems that you're

485
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,150
running into on Twitter in a blog post

486
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:18,070
in a conference talk in a lightning talk

487
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,740
grousing to your fellow employees all of

488
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,100
these things can be a good way of moving

489
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,620
the platform along making it better for

490
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,730
everybody so

491
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,210
I hope I've convinced a few of you that

492
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,410
there are little things that you can do

493
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,260
low effort and medium effort things that

494
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,810
you can do to try to get browser bugs

495
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,590
fixed when you run into them so

496
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,360
hopefully the next time you run into a

497
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,600
browser bug you can go find the bug and

498
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,090
vote on it or log the bug if you can't

499
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,270
find it if it's a bug that is really

500
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,310
holding you back consider spending some

501
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,040
time looking in to writing a cross

502
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,070
browser test so that you're saving time

503
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,690
for the browser developer they can more

504
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,450
easily justify spending time fixing it

505
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,600
and tell other people about the problem

506
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,110
maybe you can crowdsource a bit of help

507
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,360
and getting some of these things done so

508
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,820
that your bug can get fixed so please go

509
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,300
out and improve the web platform for

510
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,430
future you your fellow web developers

511
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:37,990
and everyone else in the world thank you
