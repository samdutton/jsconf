00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,980

today it's not something that comes up

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,900
that often at conferences but I have

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,450
heard a few mentioned so far at least

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,369
yesterday at CSS cops which got me

5
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,529
pretty excited to hear people talking

6
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:21,500
about accessibility so just a show of

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,939
hands how many people are familiar with

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:27,470
shadow Dom quite a few cool that's

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,779
awesome so we're going to start with a

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,860
story so imagine that you are working at

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,360
a company that's a little behind the

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,850
times they're losing engineers because

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,860
the people are pretty cool but the work

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,989
is really boring it's really stale you

15
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:44,270
don't get to do anything modern it's

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,370
like you're supporting ie7 and it kind

17
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,480
of sucks but you are in a really good

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,370
position at this company and they have

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,769
trusted you to pick the technology for a

20
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:58,160
new project they've said it can be super

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,350
modern you don't have to support IE 7 or

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:07,310
I ate or ie9 so that's awesome they've

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,500
given you this trust and you get to pick

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,200
something you start thinking man like

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,670
everyone's been talking there's so many

26
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,220
cool things out there right now and you

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,500
think web components I've heard of that

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,360
that might be pretty cool to work into a

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,250
project because you know we're only

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,560
supporting the most evergreen of

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,210
browsers which means that they update

32
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,030
themselves and we can use a polyfill and

33
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,770
that sounds awesome I think I'm going to

34
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,130
do that so you get to work on this

35
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,710
project it's like the best project ever

36
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,500
you get to your cool workstation finally

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,560
the quality of the work aligns with the

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,320
kind of work that you want to do and the

39
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,329
kind of work at a company that you want

40
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:50,149
to work at so do you go to your job

41
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:51,740
every day and you work on this amazing

42
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,040
project super cool a couple months goes

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,539
by and you need to present this project

44
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:01,189
so a couple things about this company

45
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:04,360
they hire people with disabilities and

46
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,770
you have a really awesome project

47
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,410
manager who is blind and she uses

48
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,500
microsoft project along with jaws which

49
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,270
is a screen reader it actually stands

50
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,750
for job access

51
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,120
speech actually didn't know what that

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,760
stood for but she can do her job

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,070
effectively if she is supported by the

54
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,800
technology that she needs so she'll be

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,430
in the audience also your CEO can't use

56
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,370
a mouse so you have some requirements in

57
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,230
your audience for this internal project

58
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,290
you've chosen technology that you're not

59
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,760
really sure if it's going to work for

60
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,400
them so when you go to present it are

61
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,950
you going to be a hero or are you going

62
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,360
to be sent back to the drawing board

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,010
because you didn't consider your

64
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,860
audience so we'll have to find out so

65
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,300
before we answer that question we're

66
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,470
going to do some accessibility

67
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,480
background just refresh our memories of

68
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,390
what accessibility is about how you can

69
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,209
make your projects more accessible we're

70
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:04,770
going to talk about what is the big deal

71
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,780
with web components everybody's been

72
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,340
talking about them sounds like most of

73
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,170
us have heard of it but we'll talk about

74
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,930
what that is specifically we're going to

75
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,150
talk about shadow Dom which is one part

76
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,430
of web components and then we're going

77
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,480
to talk about the accessibility

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,660
situation of web components and then

79
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,220
we'll answer that question about if

80
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,140
you're a hero or zero so when you're

81
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,510
creating things that are accessible or

82
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,940
any projects actually who are you

83
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,459
building it for I think sometimes we

84
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,470
forget that everybody has different

85
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,290
ability and it seems like some people

86
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,180
aren't actually building projects for

87
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,570
people which I find pretty peculiar so I

88
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,450
just want to remind us all that we're

89
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,190
building things for people and we all

90
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,930
have different abilities so it's

91
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,220
important to keep that in mind in

92
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,019
accessibility there are some traditional

93
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,959
groups of people that we talk about and

94
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,720
that includes blind and low-vision

95
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,299
there's people who they can see but

96
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,430
maybe they can't see very far and they

97
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,780
look at their phone really close to

98
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,870
their face all different kinds of visual

99
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,780
impairments deaf or hard of hearing so

100
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,220
if you have video you need to provide

101
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,660
captions physical disabilities there's a

102
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,789
huge range of those as well color

103
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:26,010
blindness which affects a lot of people

104
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,180
and then cognitive impairments

105
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,710
which are a little more challenging but

106
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,680
if you can make the copy in your project

107
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,599
read a little more understandably you

108
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,370
kind of cut down on the marketing speak

109
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,319
you can make something more

110
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,879
understandable to someone with a

111
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,960
cognitive impairment but really that

112
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,530
includes everybody so maybe you broke

113
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,449
your arm and you can't use a mouse for a

114
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,259
temporary period or maybe you had LASIK

115
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,180
eye surgery and you can't see for a

116
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,009
little while like we have these

117
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,539
different abilities that come and go

118
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,069
some people have to live with them

119
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,930
forever so it's important to remember

120
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,319
that not everybody can use a mouse or

121
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:13,259
see the screen so I wanted to find a

122
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,169
persona that we could focus on a little

123
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,470
bit and I remember that Stevie Wonder's

124
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,599
blind maybe I could find a picture of

125
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,310
Stevie Wonder so I went and looked for

126
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,009
one and i found this which is a picture

127
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,830
of a goat his name is actually Stevie

128
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,590
Wonder because he's a blind goat so I

129
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,389
went alright I like goats I'm gonna go

130
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,130
with that what a pic Stevie Wonder and

131
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,020
we're going to look at this graph I have

132
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,539
up on the screen that describes the

133
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,120
assistive technology process and there

134
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,979
are multiple assistive technologies but

135
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,990
the one we most commonly talked about is

136
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,139
a screen reader so in this diagram we're

137
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,690
seeing Stevie Wonder he interacts with a

138
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,940
web browser or in the case of our

139
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,069
project manager Microsoft Project so

140
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,190
some software application that software

141
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,949
application then interacts with another

142
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,900
application which is a screen reader in

143
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,029
this case and they talk back and forth

144
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:12,360
via and accessibility API and there are

145
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,180
multiple api's but there are some tricks

146
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,270
we can do to make that expanse fur of

147
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,080
data more understandable so this graph

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,719
is just indicating to you that there's

149
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,490
some interaction between the web browser

150
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,750
and the assistive technology so that was

151
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,610
the goal of this but Phoebe wonder

152
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,460
relies on his screen reader to tell him

153
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,839
what's on the screen because he can't

154
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,680
see it so in an ideal world

155
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,509
we should have everything work from the

156
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,600
keyboard have you ever navigated a

157
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,180
website without a mouse and you gave up

158
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,220
and started using the mouse because you

159
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,320
could you tried using the keyboard

160
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,820
you're having through you don't know

161
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,560
where you are maybe you got trapped

162
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,710
somewhere you gave up because you could

163
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,810
but what if you couldn't use a mouse at

164
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,740
all part of what makes this better that

165
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,030
we should do this is some low-hanging

166
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,400
fruit stuff that just applies to any

167
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,070
website that you build is that we should

168
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,470
provide good visual feedback it's really

169
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,780
helpful for everybody if you along with

170
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,880
the hover state you define a focus state

171
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,210
pretty easy right another thing you

172
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,960
consider is a logical tab order if you

173
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,849
tab through a web page what is the order

174
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,740
of elements that you see as you focus

175
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,960
throughout the screen it should go in a

176
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,509
linear fashion just no matter what your

177
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,940
layout looks like it should be logical

178
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,080
it shouldn't jump all over the place so

179
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,820
keyboard navigation is pretty important

180
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,860
if you have stuff hidden away in a mega

181
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,479
menu you should be able to get there

182
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,159
from the keyboard you shouldn't prevent

183
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,840
people who can't use a mouse from

184
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,580
navigating your website so with screen

185
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,460
reader access meaningful page structure

186
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,460
is really important so you want to

187
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,229
consider the outline of your document

188
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,130
not just the way it looks you should pay

189
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,500
attention to semantics you should use

190
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,770
headings you should think about what is

191
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,720
this document what am I trying to convey

192
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,690
and what is the best HTML that I could

193
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,820
use to communicate what is on the screen

194
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,430
right now you should have relevant non

195
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,710
visual content so if you have images you

196
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,840
need to explain what they are especially

197
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,360
in the case where we used to embed text

198
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,849
into images we have to provide that text

199
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:36,110
off-screen somehow you have to make it

200
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,909
usable without seeing basically it's

201
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,409
pretty important if you can't see the

202
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,750
screen you should know what's on it but

203
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,680
we forget that sometimes some general

204
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,180
accessibility things that we should

205
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,209
remember color contrast that's a huge

206
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,209
population of people who can't see some

207
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,610
of your texts because it doesn't stand

208
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,490
out enough over

209
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,800
the background on this slide actually I

210
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,779
had some great X where it says in an

211
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,260
ideal world and i figured that probably

212
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,060
wouldn't be readable because of this

213
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,910
monitor so i changed it and that's

214
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,230
something that we should consider is

215
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,300
your text going to be readable based on

216
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,589
you the colors that you've chosen we

217
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,450
should make experiences interactive and

218
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,120
accessible so just because you're making

219
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,100
it accessible doesn't mean it has to be

220
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,649
text only and boring you can script it

221
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,959
so that it's interactive using the

222
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,170
keyboard it's really important that we

223
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,209
consider the user experience SEO and

224
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,240
accessibility are bffs I like to think

225
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,640
of that it's a good way to sell

226
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,800
accessibility actually if you can say

227
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
that there's more than the small niche

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,270
audience that you're considering

229
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,730
actually google bot is the world's

230
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,370
largest blind user because google bot

231
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,500
can't see the screen it also needs

232
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,930
relevant text content so that's a win if

233
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,480
you can make your content work for as

234
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,300
many people as possible and Googlebot

235
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,160
mobile accessibility is a thing that we

236
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,200
have to think about we should make our

237
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,270
websites work from a screen reader on a

238
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,700
phone it's kind of a no-brainer now that

239
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,320
I realized that but at one point I

240
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,140
actually thought oh that won't matter we

241
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,790
don't need to make our mobile web pages

242
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,910
accessible you should because you have a

243
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,380
screen reader in your pocket all the

244
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,790
time it's pretty useful and then lastly

245
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,770
for general accessibility software

246
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,600
testing is really useful for this so

247
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,420
what if when you're creating a project

248
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,520
you could check whether you're about to

249
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,140
deploy code that would fail an

250
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,690
accessibility test that might be kind of

251
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,850
useful if you can lit for accessibility

252
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,970
and then on the flip side of that there

253
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,930
are methods of software testing that

254
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,880
ride on the coattails of accessibility

255
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,459
so I know an iOS development and windows

256
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,350
development sometimes you can get

257
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,380
testing to work by way of accessibility

258
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,100
api's so it's pretty awesome if you can

259
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,579
make accessibility a win for multiple

260
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,040
groups and multiple purposes

261
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,090
so checking in on our project how's it

262
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,990
going we've been working for a while

263
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,430
we've got this cool prototype we're

264
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,820
presenting just want to keep in mind

265
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,640
that we have an audience that might have

266
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,310
different needs than our own so projects

267
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,900
still going really well but we don't

268
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,700
quite know yet whether they're going to

269
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,550
be able to access it so we'll come back

270
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,560
to that so web components there are set

271
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,030
of new standards we're super excited

272
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,520
about them there's multiple parts to

273
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,510
this new standard moving through the w3c

274
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,360
HTML imports templates which we're going

275
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,090
to look at a little bit today decorators

276
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,270
I don't really use those yet but custom

277
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,090
elements and shadow Dom are super

278
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,330
important for creating web components

279
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,860
and we're going to look at those today

280
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,390
as well so why are we excited about web

281
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,460
components it's a new approach to

282
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,210
building HTML and web pages that I think

283
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,670
we we are just super excited to try

284
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,730
something different we aren't waiting on

285
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,540
browser implementers so the html5 stuff

286
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,830
came around and it was really cool

287
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,600
because we have these new range inputs

288
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,060
and we have new elements that we can use

289
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,950
that we don't have to go and script

290
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,500
everything with JavaScript so we aren't

291
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,360
waiting for browser implementers anymore

292
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,430
because we can create our own widgets

293
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,420
that have that same native effect as

294
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,640
these new elements they get rolled out

295
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,070
every so often not having to wait on a

296
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,440
browser for that to be to be able to

297
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,210
create your own it's pretty exciting web

298
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,920
components provide a way to minimize

299
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,590
conflicts and the way that I explain web

300
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,970
components to people who aren't familiar

301
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,890
at all is that it's kind of like an

302
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,890
iframe and that you are creating a

303
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,680
sandbox for your your javascript in your

304
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,970
CSS so that it is encapsulated and it's

305
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,130
separated from the rest of the document

306
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,230
so encapsulation to me is the biggest

307
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,950
win in web components and that's kind of

308
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,660
getting into where my questions about

309
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,050
accessibility came in

310
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,720
which was all right we can create the

311
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,310
sandbox so that you know CSS can't go in

312
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,440
or out depending on what styles you're

313
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,660
defining but what happens to a screen

314
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,970
reader and that's really where I started

315
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,100
wondering what is the going on here with

316
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,990
web components so I started digging in a

317
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,459
lot more and it became really

318
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:46,750
interesting so diving into the shadow

319
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,640
Dom specifically which is one part of

320
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,940
that spec the shadow Dom encapsulate say

321
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,100
dom subtree and we're going to talk a

322
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,100
little bit about what a subtree is it

323
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,260
has this idea of implementation versus

324
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,190
interface meaning that you can implement

325
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,529
a single tag but there's this whole

326
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,120
interface behind that that you didn't

327
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,640
have to implement which is pretty

328
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,950
awesome like in the case of the the

329
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,230
range input it has multiple parts to it

330
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,360
but all you're putting in your HTML is

331
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,560
one input tag shadow DOM is not a

332
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,680
shadowy underworld organization which it

333
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,779
has pretty creepy name so this interface

334
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,490
versus implementation a good example

335
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,680
that we actually see and use on the web

336
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,070
it's a video tag and we can see here we

337
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,070
have a screenshot of a there's a video i

338
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,589
just found last night actually of a goat

339
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,750
named gary and he was accused of eating

340
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,959
flowers outside a museum in sydney and

341
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,350
so we're looking at a screen capture of

342
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,290
the video with the controls and then i

343
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,959
have the devtools open and in the latest

344
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,779
chrome you can turn on this flag to show

345
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,720
shadow Dom you're probably aware of it

346
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,790
once you've enabled that you see how

347
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,220
widespread shadow Dom usage is on the

348
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,130
web it's on text areas it's on form

349
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,620
inputs any time that we have this

350
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,140
element that we can drop in just an

351
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,720
implementation it has all of these other

352
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,310
things that it comes with that we didn't

353
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,130
have to build we didn't have to create

354
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,110
the inputs for these play and pause

355
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,209
buttons over the range for the volume

356
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:29,170
slider but it comes prepackaged and it's

357
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,730
all wired up and we can use it and

358
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,130
that's awesome so the whole idea with

359
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,150
web components

360
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,610
that we could create our own versions of

361
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,290
this which is super cool so some

362
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,310
important terms the document object

363
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,980
model I mean we've all used the document

364
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,560
object model but what is it really it's

365
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,840
a it's an object-oriented tree

366
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,250
representation of an HTML document so

367
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,000
each component of that tree is a node

368
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,710
nodes can be groups nested groups and

369
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,630
when they are they become no trees or

370
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,550
sub trees so getting into the shadow Dom

371
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,090
specific stuff a shadow host is the

372
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,310
element that hosts one or more shadow

373
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:23,320
Dom trees so you have basically your

374
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,750
your video tag that's a host for a

375
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,340
shadow DOM and you can have multiple

376
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,230
trees that you shove in there this idea

377
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,810
of encapsulation in web components in

378
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,270
shadow Dom this specific term for it is

379
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,970
the shadow boundary and that is the the

380
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,820
line where scripts and styles don't

381
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,950
cross there are some exceptions and

382
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,290
there are some back doors but for the

383
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,940
most part that's the whole idea is that

384
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,880
if you define an h1 in your web

385
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,310
component it won't affect the style of

386
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,620
an h1 outside of the web component which

387
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,420
is pretty awesome because if you're

388
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,490
working alongside somebody and they've

389
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,620
written some really general CSS and it

390
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,050
screws you up well wouldn't it be nice

391
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,600
if you could both be as general as you

392
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,430
want your CSS but you don't run into

393
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:15,670
conflicts so a shadow tree is the actual

394
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,310
sub tree that gets inserted into the

395
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,540
shadow host and then finally the shadow

396
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,089
root is the root node of a shadow dom

397
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,560
subtree and this was all stuff that i

398
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,120
kind of knew and i read a little bit

399
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,950
about these terms but the more I really

400
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,220
dug into what's happening here these

401
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,390
things kept coming up so it was

402
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,610
important at least for me to understand

403
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,790
what is the Dom you know what are these

404
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,830
node trees and actually they come up a

405
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,350
lot not just in HTM

406
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,309
all so a little more about trees they

407
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:52,770
resembled nature this graphic is from a

408
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,380
book on scheme which i think is really

409
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,020
interesting so we have a root node we

410
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,110
have branches that come off of the tree

411
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,720
they have nested node groups there's

412
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,280
nothing here indicating a shadow

413
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,910
boundary or a shadow tree but it's a

414
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,650
data structure that we're pretty

415
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,690
familiar with already so we're going to

416
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:22,289
look at some shadow Dom so I have this

417
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:25,860
really simple document and it has a

418
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,559
couple of headings it has a paragraph

419
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,830
and image and a link in it so I'm just

420
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,809
going to look at the source and see what

421
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,850
like what does this look like it looks

422
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,980
like a normal document there's no

423
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,940
outline there's no indicator that

424
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,289
anything other than a regular document

425
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,890
is happening here so if we look at our

426
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:51,809
HTML source we can see that it's just

427
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,419
some pretty normal code we have a

428
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,240
template tag that's one of those new

429
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,490
items in this in the shadow or web

430
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,460
components spec and inside of it we are

431
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,250
defining some style we have a heading a

432
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,400
paragraph inside of the paragraph we

433
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,860
have another template type tag that the

434
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,710
content and it has content inside of it

435
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,559
that says meat popsicle that's a little

436
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,320
weird we don't see meat popsicle on the

437
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,720
rendered webpage so what's happening

438
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,100
there so keep going we have the image

439
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,480
and then down here at the bottom we have

440
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,350
a custom tag called goat stuff pretty

441
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,870
sure there is not a goat stuff tagged

442
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,750
already the only requirement with web

443
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,059
components and custom elements is that

444
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,429
you add a hyphen in the middle so the

445
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:43,289
word before the hyphen is effectively a

446
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:46,140
namespace so I'm calling the goat

447
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,909
namespace just to hand so what's going

448
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:53,789
on here is that we have one word in our

449
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:56,580
shadow host the goat stuff tagged as our

450
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,330
shadow host

451
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,190
we have a template that has a bunch of

452
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,800
stuff in it that we're going to grab and

453
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,890
then insert into our custom tag but one

454
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,330
thing we haven't really figured out is

455
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,450
what is this meat popsicle business so

456
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,830
if I go back to our demo we can see it

457
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,370
says I'm a goat it's got the image so if

458
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:23,980
I go and look at it in the dev tools

459
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,230
like this a little bigger okay so this

460
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,150
is a little different representation

461
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,790
because this is after javascript has run

462
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,520
so this is after your HTML has been

463
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,250
affected by JavaScript and CSS it's a

464
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,210
different representation of your webpage

465
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,010
so we drill into this goat stuff tagged

466
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,190
we can see we've got a shadow root we've

467
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,840
got some style we've got a paragraph tag

468
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,910
it's the same stuff we've got this

469
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,250
content it still says meat popsicle but

470
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,170
I'm not seeing that I'm seeing in the

471
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,720
ghost stuff tagged we have goat so

472
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,370
what's happening here is that goat is

473
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,350
being projected into the content tagged

474
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,330
and that is what gets rendered to you

475
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,170
even though after rendering we're still

476
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,910
seeing meat popsicle in the dev tools

477
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,590
but that doesn't ever get rendered to

478
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,300
the screen so that's one of the really

479
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,760
to me one of the strangest parts about

480
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,630
shadow Dom but I am still curious what's

481
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,860
going to happen at a screen reader

482
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:33,360
they're not quite sure yet so to get

483
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,510
that shadow Dom stuff to work polymer is

484
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,000
a really awesome polyfill and they have

485
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,640
a set of components that you can use but

486
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,590
before I got into that I wanted to build

487
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,350
it myself I wanted to know exactly what

488
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,510
goes into this I want to learn it really

489
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,610
well before I go and add a bunch of

490
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,830
tools that somebody else has made so in

491
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,510
the latest chrome I could create a

492
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,170
little bit of JavaScript I'm going and

493
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,940
grabbing the contents out of a template

494
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,960
tag I'm creating a new element so you

495
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,230
extend a basic HTML element which we're

496
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,720
seeing here with object.create and then

497
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,170
we're copying the prototype

498
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,860
just from a very generic HTML element

499
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,350
when that element gets created which

500
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,850
we've registered down here on the bottom

501
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,370
we register the goat stuff element and

502
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,670
then we set its prototype to be this

503
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,760
goat component when that gets created it

504
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,560
has a callback function and that's when

505
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,690
you can start doing stuff to it that's

506
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,880
when you can change the content that's

507
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,400
when you can enable some of these back

508
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,290
doors for your scripts you can find

509
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,470
events and polymer does a really great

510
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,740
job of abstract amiss away but and I'm

511
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,320
finally ready to move to that now but it

512
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,180
was really useful to go through and see

513
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:55,150
what is happening so about that boundary

514
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,530
I mentioned there are some back doors

515
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,480
and this stuff still trips me up a

516
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,520
little bit I think it's really odd so

517
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,030
when you create your CSS for your main

518
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,700
document tree if you define a font on

519
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,980
your body tag you would think that the

520
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,110
shadow Dom would be encapsulated so that

521
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,780
it would not get the same font face but

522
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,750
it does that's one of the few styles

523
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,940
that actually goes past the boundary so

524
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,250
it's a little unexpected but there is

525
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,470
this JavaScript property that you can

526
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,720
set called reset style inheritance and

527
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,360
that will wipe out any of those cascades

528
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,540
that go through the boundary there's

529
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,570
also apply author styles which allows

530
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,360
your parent stylesheet to go into the

531
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,240
shadow Dom so you as the document

532
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,300
creator have that control you can say do

533
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,790
I want the styles to go in or not if I'm

534
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,610
implementing some widget that some

535
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,340
third-party developer created I want to

536
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,840
be able to override their styles but I

537
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,310
don't want them to be able to override

538
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,250
mine so you have this control as the

539
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,800
parent document owner and these are the

540
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,900
the tools that you can use for that so

541
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,360
going back to the trees and looking at

542
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,240
if we have a shadow host and this image

543
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,950
comes right out of the shadow Dom spec

544
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,080
which I've had open in my browser for

545
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,250
six months so we have a shadow host and

546
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,520
this image is describing that it has

547
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,980
children in it

548
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,340
which actually get replaced by a shadow

549
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,470
Dom which we're showing here on the

550
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,970
right side of the graphic there's a

551
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,250
shadow boundary so that's indicating the

552
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,620
encapsulation and then we have the

553
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,169
shadow root which is the parent node of

554
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,890
a bunch of children and the shadow Dom

555
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,890
spec is actually really awesome as far

556
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:50,710
as specs go so we looked at our demo but

557
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,789
we didn't answer whether it was

558
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:53,919
accessible or not it looks okay it

559
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,900
looked like a normal document so we're

560
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,299
going to go back to that demo and I'm

561
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,250
just going to start tabbing through I

562
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,150
could tab on to the link that's cool 37

563
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,669
voiceover basic demo shadow Dom

564
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:09,940
accessibility window basic demo heading

565
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,940
level 1 shadow dumb down low we gotta we

566
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,010
gotta heading heading level two main

567
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,659
document that's still the main document

568
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:18,190
so now I'm going to go into the shadow

569
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,130
Dom heading level two goats stuff all

570
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,080
right we went over the boundary it read

571
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,740
it iono coat I'm a goat fancy goat image

572
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,010
goat simulator gameplay hands-on no joke

573
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,909
all goat visited link voiceover off so

574
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:36,059
that's awesome we went into the boundary

575
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:40,000
cool so that kind of like all right it's

576
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,110
accessible and it worked but why did

577
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,560
that work

578
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:53,399
what what why did that work and that's

579
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:55,830
what I wanted to know so a little bit

580
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,630
about web browsers and screen readers

581
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,870
and how they work the difference between

582
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,450
our view source and our rendered markup

583
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,510
was that the web browser takes your HTML

584
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,730
it creates objects from the markup

585
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,299
that's what the DOM is the Dom has been

586
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,640
altered by your CSS your JavaScript and

587
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,760
Aria or accessible rich Internet

588
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,200
applications if you use any roles or

589
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,049
states or properties those affect the

590
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,500
tree that gets created web components

591
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,950
also create a sub tree so that is added

592
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,460
to the larger tree the screen reader

593
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,980
uses the objects in the render Dom so it

594
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,659
gets one big tree and that is called an

595
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,520
accessibility tree and that is what is

596
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,559
presented to the screen reader user or a

597
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,559
screen magnifier I thought that was

598
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,419
really interesting it was pretty key to

599
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:52,110
what made shadow Dom work so how do you

600
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,320
make accessible web components you write

601
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,330
accessible code it's pretty simple but

602
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,179
we forget that stuff sometimes and if

603
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:01,890
you don't you might get knocked by this

604
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:09,960
goat like this newscaster lady boom okay

605
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,429
so how do you write accessible code

606
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,610
little recap you use native and semantic

607
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,029
HTML so use headings inside of your web

608
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:19,799
components use native and semantic HTML

609
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,500
if you have a button make it a button

610
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,899
don't make it a div like just try to use

611
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:27,059
the HTML the way it was intended and

612
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:30,390
you'll have a lot better time you want

613
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,960
to make readable text content you want

614
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,380
to provide visual feedback you need to

615
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,289
use focus management and use JavaScript

616
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:42,090
events to send the user around your

617
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,390
experience and then finally you can use

618
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,600
Aria to fill in gaps where HTML doesn't

619
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,950
quite meet your needs but you should

620
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,320
have exhausted all upward all avenues

621
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,870
with native HTML first so one last look

622
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,649
and I'm actually going to use a

623
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:00,300
different screen reader this time

624
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,960
news MV da which is on Windows and i'm

625
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,420
going to use virtualbox for that and one

626
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,310
quick note I was going to use jaws but I

627
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,440
had trouble getting it installed on this

628
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,420
machine but if you're going to test for

629
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,030
accessibility you can actually use the

630
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,030
demo version of Jaws 445 or 40 minutes

631
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,840
at a time just a side note explode but

632
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,540
MV da is a free one so I'm going to

633
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,070
hover over things and it'll read it

634
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,760
explosions explosions and a little

635
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,230
background of this component actually

636
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,390
was I was thinking if I'm going to make

637
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,970
an encapsulated component what would be

638
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,640
useful and I thought that a single

639
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,350
button that was kind of like a nuclear

640
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,980
detonator that you could engage and then

641
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,810
have it expose another kind of a button

642
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,030
that would be kind of cool but I didn't

643
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,770
know how I would create that so I made a

644
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,220
little it has a certain part of it you

645
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,440
have to slide to engage it it exposes

646
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,330
another button and then explosions will

647
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,050
happen one hut are you sure are you sure

648
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,390
you want to engage it choose a

649
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,380
percentage between 0 and 100 0 % all

650
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,980
right I'm gonna do it yes really yes are

651
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,880
you sure are we sure yes really all

652
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,770
right really we're really sure main

653
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:22,620
landmark yes goats on metal jib so what

654
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,720
happened there with it it was reading

655
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,630
out the parts of the component so the

656
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,730
encapsulated parts get read aloud just

657
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,350
fine and that's because you get

658
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,840
presented with one big tree and I

659
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,580
thought that was really cool I learned a

660
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,340
lot about how screen readers work I

661
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,040
learned how browsers work and it really

662
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,020
transcended just something about

663
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,820
accessibility I thought that was pretty

664
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:53,230
awesome get me out of here Rob Firefox

665
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,220
alright so one little note about support

666
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,470
polymer has this great matrix up on

667
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,810
their website to show you and i just

668
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,660
added their polyfill to extend support

669
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,720
beyond just chrome and firefox but I eat

670
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,180
n is as far back as you can go so just a

671
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,220
quick recap we want to develop

672
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,409
the ideal we want to develop for people

673
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:17,880
because why else are you doing it

674
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,179
otherwise web components provide

675
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:25,140
encapsulation shadow DOM is accessible

676
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,270
and it's accessible because screen

677
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,350
readers utilize the Dom as rendered and

678
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,100
finally you want to pick the right

679
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,030
technology for your audience so how'd

680
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,700
you do on your project well your

681
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,440
executives came in and your project

682
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,750
manager and who couldn't see the screen

683
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,640
and they demoed your project just fine

684
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,039
because web components are accessible so
