00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,390

so hello everyone my name is Gonzalo

2
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,190
Cordero and i'm here to talk to you

3
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,850
today about why why mobile development

4
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,939
so before I before I go I want to get a

5
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:29,680
sense how many of you are familiar with

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,550
Yui cool how many of you are familiar

7
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,809
with any of the Yui mobile features cool

8
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:39,280
even better so hopefully you'll learn

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,120
something today so when I'm gonna be

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,970
covering is I'm going to talk about some

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,739
of this stuff you can start using today

12
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,970
to in order to create a killer mobile

13
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,940
apps using Yui I'm gonna show a little

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,530
peek into the what's coming to the

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,580
future and as well as you know i'll show

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,879
you a couple of cool demos as well too

17
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,130
so a couple of statements first Yui

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,770
philosophy in this mobile environment is

19
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,720
that we think that you should not be

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,240
having to write your code depending on

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,700
which device you'd apply the deploying

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,830
to we believe that you should rather

23
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,439
want and that cause you just work across

24
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,770
all your different devices and the

25
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,240
second thing I would like to say is that

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,609
everything that you need to create a

27
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:33,689
killer molap it's already out there

28
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,009
using why why so there's nothing

29
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,399
stopping you for creating really good

30
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,539
experiences on your mobile applications

31
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,880
and I'll show a couple of examples as

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,749
well so some of the features that you

33
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:48,450
might want to be using when you're

34
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,990
designing your model applications are

35
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,659
some of these guys right here so the

36
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:58,119
loader 414 that this is you who are now

37
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,170
familiar with what the loader is and why

38
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,270
basically what it does it's just that it

39
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,789
brings it lowes to your page whatever

40
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,399
modules you need and on the man as you

41
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,819
need them not only that but the loader

42
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,610
it's so cool and so sophisticated I will

43
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,040
know which device you're deploying to

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,440
and depending on what you are it will

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,810
just give you the set of files and

46
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,850
modules that you need just for that so

47
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,090
what what this means to you is a let's

48
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,370
say that you on your coat

49
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,720
the note component of why why so if you

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,540
deploy this up on the desktop then it

51
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,519
will give you all the desktop necessary

52
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,980
stuff that you need in order to work but

53
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,170
if you were gonna deploy your app on a

54
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,150
mobile device it will know that it's a

55
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,530
mobile device and they'll all these

56
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,079
serve you they know the specific stuff

57
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,000
that applies to that device so again

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,530
it's a pretty cool stuff and you can do

59
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,079
it's actually it's gonna it's about to

60
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,720
get way better because we're going to be

61
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,950
introducing soon why LS so while it is

62
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,209
something that we're very excited about

63
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,150
which is we're taking back the loader

64
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,670
back from the client to the server and

65
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,000
so basically what without it's going to

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,359
do is a all the dependencies calculation

67
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,530
is going to happen now in the server

68
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,989
which means we're gonna it's going to be

69
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,799
way faster is using kno jes and if we

70
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,470
also have this cache layer on top of

71
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,040
that we're basically if you request a

72
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,200
module that someone else has requested

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,829
before it will serve from the couch gosh

74
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,160
so it's going to be extremely fast and

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,650
we think you're gonna love it and so

76
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,030
keep an eye for that on 3 4 wireless

77
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,849
alright so let me just talk about the

78
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,489
modules some of the widgets that I think

79
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,049
I apply for more a while a little bit

80
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:57,790
the first one I'm going to talk about

81
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,120
transition so the transition module

82
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,090
basically what it does is a you will let

83
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,319
you define some sort of visual

84
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,540
representation or behavior when you move

85
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,359
from point A to point B or from when you

86
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,430
move an element from one state to the

87
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,239
other say you you know let's say you you

88
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:21,940
know you swipe or you flick and you want

89
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,410
to navigate to the next page and you

90
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,020
want to show some sort of feedback to

91
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,300
the user that you're navigating so

92
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,990
transition model will do that for you

93
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,729
you know again although the cross

94
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:35,849
browser staff and you know if it

95
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:38,560
hardware acceleration is they will use

96
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,010
it so you know what this means to you is

97
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,330
in certain

98
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,009
do something like this where you're

99
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:46,990
going to have you know to manually set

100
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,539
all these different properties for your

101
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,180
transition then you can just easily

102
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,789
apply in all of these into the node

103
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:59,250
itself that you wish to transition from

104
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,729
so again much simpler much cleaner you

105
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:07,090
specified the duration the value that

106
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,879
you're going to and this is using css3

107
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,810
when available on the back as well so

108
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,150
it's similar to that for you and the

109
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,330
developer you don't have to worry about

110
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:25,020
browsers vendors specific prefixes and

111
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,319
yeah just making your life simpler same

112
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,500
fashion the history API or the history

113
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,039
module what this does is a will let you

114
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,180
tweak the back and forward button on the

115
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,620
browser so you can apply custom actions

116
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,580
to those to the 22 to the buttons so

117
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,349
imagine that you have some sort of

118
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,050
built-in navigation control your mobile

119
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,599
app and what you want is when the user

120
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,639
hit the back button on the browser

121
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,889
button which is kind of like common now

122
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,629
on android devices you have the actual

123
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,330
physical keys to go back and forth so

124
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,490
what you want is just so in navigation

125
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,430
within your app so you can do this with

126
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,330
done using history again you know just a

127
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,460
little bit of a code example it's pretty

128
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,379
simple all you need to do is instantiate

129
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:20,020
the history object you can passing an

130
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,819
initial state if you want you don't have

131
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:26,169
to and then you can modify as you go

132
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,409
with add and remove all so it will give

133
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:31,690
you all these different events you can

134
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,300
you can subscribe to to detect

135
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,789
interesting moment and to change you

136
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:40,360
have to so priest and ER if you use Yui

137
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,659
before on how we you know we'd always

138
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,659
publish all these events for you to

139
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:49,000
tweak your application so let me just

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,910
show you a quick demo online on this too

141
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:59,410
tavion history so so in this case let's

142
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,810
say you know I created this tab control

143
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,610
right I'm by the way all the all the

144
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,870
examples are going to be showing off

145
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,720
today are available in the YY library so

146
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,730
you can just you know look on your own

147
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,070
time and then play around with it but

148
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,200
basically let's say I have a some sort

149
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,030
of navigation like this where it's gone

150
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,550
it's gonna navigate through the content

151
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,540
so as I go and I want to go back instead

152
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,520
of going back to you know the previous

153
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,230
pages are visited on the browser history

154
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,170
it's just gonna let me navigate through

155
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,860
my little widget here so I think pretty

156
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,200
honey if you're if you need to do

157
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,030
something custom for your mobile

158
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,560
application in terms of navigation and

159
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,570
I'm going to be showing them at the end

160
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,100
that kind of capsule is everything it's

161
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,150
like a real life example so just holding

162
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:57,150
their hang in there okay so now we're

163
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,890
let me talk about events a little bit

164
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,390
now because I think this is a pre

165
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,320
interesting so event we provide you a

166
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,320
set of the regular events are available

167
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,090
right now for all the devices out there

168
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,840
like touch move and touch star and then

169
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,419
all the iOS specific ones you know

170
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:19,000
gesture star on your gesture change and

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,430
what not but on top of that we also

172
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,669
giving you a set of synthetic events you

173
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:28,330
can subscribe to so two of the most

174
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,010
interesting ones are the flick giving

175
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,640
and the other gestures so let's say you

176
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,669
wanna you know you have a something with

177
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,520
with media alright like like like a

178
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,320
carousel with pictures or something and

179
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,360
you want to be able just to swipe make

180
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,580
flick like that and just like navigate

181
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,610
so why why we'll give you this event

182
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,150
called flick you can subscribe to pass a

183
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,200
set of different properties and again

184
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,600
this is very highly customizable and you

185
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,230
can really achieve need

186
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,999
look and feel if you tweak with those

187
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:05,879
settings a little pain but then I mean

188
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,160
that's it's pretty simple you just pass

189
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,709
in the distance and the velocity and why

190
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:13,679
not and then you know it will behave

191
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,329
like a native if you want to have more

192
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:20,670
control what's happening on that flick

193
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,600
event we also provide you events you can

194
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,059
subscribe to take when the gesture

195
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:30,389
actually starts and when it moves and

196
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,670
when the user lifted at the finger of

197
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,399
the of the other mobile device and then

198
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,350
you can react to it and do you know

199
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,850
whatever you need to do so again pretty

200
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,269
highly customizable and you can

201
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:47,100
definitely achieve a lot of the native

202
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,100
coolness with just using web let me show

203
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,689
you a quick demo on the flick stuff then

204
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:14,130
you having the simulator

205
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,490
okay so in this case we have this little

206
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,860
list you know it's pretty pretty common

207
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,540
where you have on your mobile devices

208
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,300
like a list view of items right and this

209
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,620
is again all HTML CSS and why why what

210
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,660
you want to do is uh you want to show

211
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,220
pressing the user like I made like a

212
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,170
shortcut to be able to delete these

213
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,910
items as the user navigates really so

214
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,230
just going to have to use the mouse but

215
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,570
again get worse with your your finger on

216
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,360
touch event as well but as you strive to

217
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,160
the left we're presenting this delete

218
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,530
button here right here and as you delete

219
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,420
then we use in transition to collapse

220
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,370
all the list so you know not too fancy

221
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,370
but you get the idea and you know this

222
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,980
open the door opens the door to a lot of

223
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,510
things on your when you're thinking

224
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,240
about creating your mobile application

225
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,920
and you know you're presented with us

226
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,250
aspects or marks and behavior you can

227
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,680
question if do you really need to do it

228
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,680
using native control when you can just

229
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,740
do it using web using why I for example

230
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,960
and then it will just work across all

231
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,730
your devices and don't have to maintain

232
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:30,090
different code bases so

233
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,820
and the last which I want to talk about

234
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,890
before going to the demos is the

235
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,670
scrollview widget so scrub you basically

236
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,800
what gives you the scrollable content

237
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,560
that reacts to swipe events or touch

238
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,760
events you can make it horizontal

239
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,390
horizontal or vertically aligned and

240
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,360
then you did this plugins to to make it

241
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,090
behave the way you want it and bouncy

242
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,190
and whatnot and like i said i'll show

243
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,500
you an example in a little bit and how

244
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,940
do you use it it's pretty simple you

245
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,750
just feed a bunch of you know since or

246
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,830
markup that contains maybe images and

247
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,630
some context and then you sang she ate

248
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,940
the scrollview object and here you can

249
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,390
just tell okay so I want my flick even

250
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,710
to react at this minimum velocity or the

251
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,180
deceleration has to be this or you know

252
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,850
want to bounce this many pixels and

253
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,860
whatnot so again really highly

254
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,500
customizable you can really achieve

255
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,270
really good looking we hit like apps and

256
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,070
on behavior Sunday that mimic like

257
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,800
native which as web and to the example

258
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,520
okay so for the past couple of months or

259
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,280
so I mean working on this this is a new

260
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,440
yahoo local app that's going to be on

261
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,380
the app store soon it just something is

262
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,930
like a hyper-local up you can just find

263
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,540
deals and things going on around where

264
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,800
you are so when we initially represented

265
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,839
the marks and the specs you know that

266
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,180
you know everyone was a moment obviously

267
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,010
now we have to write all of this in

268
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,470
Objective C but then we as we start

269
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,600
going we start realizing that everything

270
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,440
which has been done using web on Yui and

271
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,600
not only that but when we decide to

272
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,360
launch this into Android will have to do

273
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,180
nothing you know just work I mean

274
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,720
granted the navigation its native but

275
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,460
you know does the only piece that will

276
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,720
have to write whenever we go to

277
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,009
android so for example this pull down to

278
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,980
refresh event that you know it's pretty

279
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,899
common in this mobile app out there we

280
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,620
being able to mimic using just web same

281
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,120
with this guy right here this is a

282
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,519
little scope oui je where you can just

283
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,560
swipe your fingers to see the different

284
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,899
movies going around your neighborhood

285
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:09,899
and we also using css3 plus 30 mins we

286
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,050
cannot leave this castle that looks like

287
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,100
iOS coverflow 20 side again you know

288
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,480
just using Yui 3 or web components

289
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,759
highly scalable so let me just show you

290
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:44,560
a demo day of the whole phone

291
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,790
by the way it's been it's been an

292
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,690
earthquake I guess so in California

293
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:57,080
centrica anyways so we have this weather

294
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,540
widget right here you know you see the

295
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,810
bounce all that is web using Yui same

296
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,540
with this guy right here that was

297
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,090
talking about earlier for the movies see

298
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,200
okay so you know all the issues using

299
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,350
web using scroll YY scroll view as well

300
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,510
as this guy right here and you know as

301
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,450
we swipe you know this thing changes and

302
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,960
all this just two inches a plan in css3

303
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,840
class to the element and using Yui flick

304
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,070
event so you know you get the idea you

305
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,110
don't really need to rely on a lot of

306
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,470
native staff you can just use web to

307
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,960
achieve and to get to this production

308
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,950
level quality apps does it pull down to

309
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,970
refresh 22 to create applications and

310
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,190
again this should just work on Android

311
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,220
so development time it's it's pretty

312
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:07,340
pretty fast so just dropping some

313
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,030
thoughts you know I know that why why

314
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,910
historically has all this a large amount

315
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,830
of widgets in the desktop and you know

316
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,120
maybe some of you are wondering okay

317
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,560
what happens to those with just one of

318
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,180
those which is going to be ported to to

319
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,850
mobile so the answer is that we're

320
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,070
working on a on a solution for that

321
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,290
right now we're trying to think how we

322
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,340
want to create or this skin you know the

323
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,500
skin for the widgets and and and you

324
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,200
know the level of skill so they're

325
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,080
agnostic intense of the device are you

326
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,180
running into the point into the the

327
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,270
different widgets so again we're working

328
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,740
on it we just want to make sure that we

329
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,470
get it right so keep an eye for 34

330
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,810
because we're going to bring a lot of

331
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,490
stuff for mobile we're going to be

332
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,329
bringing a lot of the

333
00:16:57,329 --> 00:17:00,399
navigation controls are you so that I we

334
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,129
had to do natively we can produce this

335
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:07,959
after 34 ditches using Yui as well we're

336
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,220
going to bring widgets we're going to

337
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,230
bring data logs and overlays and things

338
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,730
like that so again and wireless so in

339
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,069
the meantime though if you are a Yui

340
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,470

341
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,169
