00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,500

um I want to talk about the jQuery

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,750
divide its kind of you know I got the

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,519
email for multi things so what are you

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,440
talking about and I made this up this

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,420
title but I want to talk about it and I

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,369
hesitated to do a talk about jQuery in

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,230
front of this audience because I think

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,310
that by and large this audience is is

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,630
pretty aware of some of the limitations

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,189
i didn't want to get up here and tell

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,540
you stuff that you already know but i

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,640
think that i do have some important

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,930
things that this audience does need to

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,540
hear about jQuery and the role that I

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,190
think it's playing in the JavaScript

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,489
community at large so I know we're all

17
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,590
tired and it's near the end of the day

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,539
um so I'm going to keep this nice and

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,570
short and you should all use dojo the

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,620
end I wish that it was it was it's it's

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,030
been a wonderful tool kit for me to

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,949
learn and its really opened my eyes to a

23
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,620
lot of things i'll be going to jquery

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,220
Boston in a couple of weeks trying not

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,500
to say you should all use dojo we'll see

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,400
how I do this to me came out just I

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,310
don't know a couple days ago and I think

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,200
it speaks really well to what I want to

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,420
talk about today that it used to be that

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,360
JavaScript was a toy and we just used it

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,600
to get stuff done and somebody was

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,369
saying that they would actually get

33
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,259
resumes from people who knew JavaScript

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,540
but they wouldn't put it on the resume

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,890
because they were afraid that it was

36
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,689
going to make them look like a less

37
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,460
legitimate developer a less serious

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,170
developer and I think that's really

39
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,540
changed and now it's becoming the case

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,460
that if you don't know JavaScript and if

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,259
you don't take it seriously you are

42
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:48,710
setting yourself up for some real hurt

43
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,700
so there's three things that I want to

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,220
kind of hit on today number one I want

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,880
to talk about how I think jquery and its

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,060
popularity among newcomers is making

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,619
those newcomers learn some really

48
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,909
terrible things and you know the ease of

49
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,009
the ubiquity of it the popularity of it

50
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,110
means it's the go to library for a lot

51
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,629
of people who don't have any programming

52
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,200
experience

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,629
on some levels that's wonderful on other

54
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,989
levels it's terrifying as a I work for

55
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,980
myself I consult with companies who call

56
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,900
me up and say you help us fix this

57
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,959
gigantic mess that we've made so i'll

58
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,310
talk about that in a minute i also want

59
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,599
to talk about why i think that this

60
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,450
audience needs to care about this this

61
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,239
audience who'd you know very few of you

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,920
would admit that you didn't understand

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,880
call and apply so that's probably true

64
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,590
here but but i know that i'm not

65
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,239
speaking to an audience that needs a

66
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,010
lecture on the jquery api or what's

67
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,239
wrong with it or what's good about it

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,890
but i do think that this topic is

69
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,150
important to this audience and number

70
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,590
three I want to talk about what I think

71
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,890
that we as the people who assemble

72
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,500
together at this fairly exclusive

73
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,650
conference that you know turns away more

74
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,310
people and probably get in why what we

75
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,110
who are here actually need to do about

76
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,260
this that we shouldn't just let the

77
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,780
status quo be what it is I think that we

78
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,700
actually have a responsibility to take

79
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,920
some ownership of this problem it was

80
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,500
about a year a year ago year a half ago

81
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,150
that I started talking about code

82
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,780
organization in the jQuery community it

83
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,400
was a problem that i was running into as

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,680
i was using jquery it was a problem that

85
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,329
other people were definitely sensitive

86
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,250
to so it's about a year ago that i

87
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,359
started talking about it writing blog

88
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:34,920
posts about it i spoke at the jquery

89
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,319
conference in Boston about it last year

90
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,620
and through doing all of that talking I

91
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,019
find that a lot of people are calling me

92
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,170
and saying help we've done terrible

93
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,239
things and I'm proud of them for calling

94
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,620
me I'm proud of them for asking these

95
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,510
questions I'm impressed that people are

96
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,340
realizing sort of like Nicole was

97
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,599
talking about the CSS people are

98
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,150
realizing that this is actually a

99
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,130
problem it's a maintenance problem it's

100
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,420
a skill it's a extensibility problem

101
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,239
they they find themselves copying and

102
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,769
pasting like Nicole was talking about

103
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,560
instead of actually solving problems or

104
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,060
looking at their application in a big

105
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,639
picture sort of way so I applaud them

106
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,169
for saying you know I have a problem

107
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:22,019
that's the first step right so I say

108
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,479
sure I can help you and you know jquery

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,100
it

110
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,710
events a Jackson effects library it's

111
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,960
decent most of that it has some others

112
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,510
parts of it that I don't like when it

113
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,100
comes to some pieces of that but that's

114
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,930
what it does dumb Ajax events and

115
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,270
effects and what I'm hearing you tell me

116
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,820
dear client is that your needs are

117
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,280
actually a little bit bigger than this

118
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,560
and in my experience when you start

119
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,120
doing anything remotely serious with

120
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,980
JavaScript then your needs are actually

121
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,950
bigger than Dom Ajax events and effects

122
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,840
so we're off to a good start needing

123
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,420
this client and then but we must keep

124
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,370
using jQuery because it's easy and it's

125
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,670
popular and we don't want to hear about

126
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,830
any other options you know yeah you can

127
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,270
talk about the other options but really

128
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,540
we we want to stick with jquery we are

129
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,310
not willing to it's too easy it's too

130
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,800
easy we can't give that up and so at

131
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,270
this point now it's just sort of

132
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,950
entertaining because I'd been I've had

133
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,450
these conversations over and over and

134
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,920
over again and so this might say well

135
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,130
let me see your code let's take a look

136
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,480
at your code and see what it is you're

137
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,890
doing um this is obfuscated adha you

138
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,360
just enough that the client who sent it

139
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,920
to me to review it won't know it was

140
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,530
them but a terrible terrible this

141
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,330
is I mean Pete and I were upstairs

142
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,070
looking at it it's just it's amazing it

143
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,950
is so completely Dom centric it's

144
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,690
selections happening over and over and

145
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,760
over again on the exact same thing I

146
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,320
mean some of this stuff i don't know if

147
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,700
i put it up on the screen but some of

148
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,380
this stuff is like line for line

149
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,690
repeated except it's in a different it's

150
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,090
like a different if statement this is

151
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,080
what people well intentioned people who

152
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,080
are using jquery this is these these are

153
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,370
the answers that they're coming up with

154
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,610
to mildly complicated problems this I

155
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,050
think was on a search something from a

156
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,340
search results page or something like

157
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,190
that so mildly complicated problems not

158
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,290
you know we're not talking rocket

159
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,060
science here my only complex problems

160
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,010
that are more than just get some

161
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,930
elements and do something with them but

162
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,520
they're still approaching it's a get

163
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,870
some elements and do something with them

164
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,030
kind of problem instead of considering

165
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,290
how to actually architect their

166
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,780
application and then this is my favorite

167
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,889
part

168
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,319
is when they say that the real reason

169
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,610
they need to stick with jQuery is

170
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,680
because their database guys like they

171
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,319
get it and so and you know maybe they're

172
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,539
java developers they get it to and so we

173
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:47,210
can't do anything that actually means

174
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,590
that those people can't continue

175
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,419
contributing to the team and it's uh

176
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,729
yeah I don't know what to say about that

177
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,029
a really big believer that front end

178
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:00,680
developers should be doing front end and

179
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,449
let's groom the front end developers to

180
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:03,889
get the front end developers doing

181
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,139
better front end stuff when we pull in

182
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:10,330
people who don't have expertise in the

183
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,759
browser environment well we get that

184
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,759
code that we saw so I tell the story to

185
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,590
illustrate four points number one the

186
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,120
perceived popularity of jQuery is

187
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,819
pervasive the Percy's perceived ease of

188
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,849
use if factor is pervasive and it really

189
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,379
factors into the library choices that

190
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,319
people are making number two people who

191
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,419
don't know how to write JavaScript are

192
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,610
doing non trivial things with it and we

193
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,849
can't stop them the best that we can do

194
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:39,800
is help them do them better I've talked

195
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,770
to some people this weekend whoo hoo I

196
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,029
think would prefer to see the market

197
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:49,099
just just dispose of these people

198
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,430
because they're not good but the fact is

199
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,050
people are doing our writing complicated

200
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,270
things whether they should or not and I

201
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,539
think that's problem we need to address

202
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:00,919
number three there's actually demand for

203
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,270
the answers to these questions people

204
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,669
are realizing they've created problems

205
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:05,839
they don't know what to do about it

206
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,060
number for the people seeking these

207
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,219
answers they're not necessarily dumb

208
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:11,990
they just don't know what they don't

209
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,810
know and so they they come to me with

210
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,729
this sort of code and they don't even

211
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,149
know how to begin to solve the problem

212
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:21,680
because jQuery again has taught them

213
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,240
this get some elements and do something

214
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,310
with them and that's the only way that

215
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,330
they've really learned to think about

216
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,330
JavaScript this is a really freaky

217
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,019
moment because there's crockford and

218
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:37,099
there's crockford and weird but in in

219
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,870
one of your UI UI theater talks I went

220
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,490
and they have a transcript which is

221
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,019
fabulous i didn't have to listen to the

222
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,980
whole thing again to find this quote

223
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,839
um mrs. it turns out if you have

224
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,190
absolutely no idea what you're doing the

225
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,170
language you can still generally make

226
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,940
things work and that's very true weed

227
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,269
and I know I personally that's kind of

228
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,399
how I got started with this and I'm

229
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,649
embarrassed about it a little bit but

230
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,740
the frightening thing especially is that

231
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,000
you were actually talking about the good

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,279
parts when you said this was actually a

233
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,010
good thing and I is a good thing it is a

234
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,430
good thing because it has exposed I mean

235
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,230
I like to see people learn new things

236
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,079
and jQuery has provided a gateway to the

237
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,199
to that that didn't exist before and

238
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:25,380
it's almost in some ways like this this

239
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,829
is jquery's mission statement and that's

240
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:30,959
slightly frightened part for me is that

241
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,649
it it seems to almost encourage he's

242
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,880
going to tweet this I'm gonna get in

243
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,459
trouble it seems to almost encourage

244
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,019
people not to learn the underlying

245
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,730
language not to learn the bigger

246
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,279
questions and Pete talked about this

247
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,680
this morning saying big inspect by this

248
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,199
is smarting saying that we need to

249
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:54,240
encourage people to actually learn the

250
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,730
language before they learn libraries

251
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,850
because we lose a lot if we don't so

252
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,639
it's this being jquery's mission

253
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,440
statement in some ways is good because

254
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,199
it means that instead of writing this

255
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:14,519
which was terrible and scared me when I

256
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,620
was looking at javascript before their

257
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,240
libraries like I had no interest in

258
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,060
trying to figure out what all this meant

259
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,959
instead of writing that we can write

260
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,100
this and that's cool this jquery wasn't

261
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,529
the first library to make shorter syntax

262
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:29,880
as possible it was just the first

263
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,050
library to make it so stupid simple that

264
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,569
that people really started to embrace it

265
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,880
i think and people who didn't have any

266
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,339
hope of understanding this started to

267
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,870
embrace this and start to say we can

268
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,380
start doing neat things with javascript

269
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,170
so would i see often and what i showed

270
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,889
in that example code is that when we

271
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,110
have an application like this jquery

272
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,449
offers a really pleasant way to make it

273
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,390
work it's like 15 lines you know we go

274
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:00,930
out we

275
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,580
when somebody enters some text into the

276
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,290
search box we fire off an AJAX request

277
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,200
get some results and throw it into the

278
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,600
search results area it makes it really

279
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,550
easy to write code like that and that's

280
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,339
why this ubiquitous graph is what it is

281
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:18,029
this shows the pop the search trends of

282
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:21,750
jQuery versus everything else in the

283
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,160
last several years jQuery is the blue

284
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,420
line and it wins so it's that simplicity

285
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,160
that's led to this and it's that

286
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,230
simplicity that has led to this this is

287
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,230
a graph from indeed com which tracks job

288
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,630
advertisements and the number of people

289
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,690
looking for jQuery in their job

290
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,490
advertisements is just going off the

291
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,160
charts so it's that simplicity that has

292
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,440
driven this crazy adoption jquery even

293
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,630
teaches us how to do you know tabs we

294
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,820
can do that with jquery UI we can do a

295
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,470
little accordion over on the side we can

296
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,170
do some radio buttons and style them all

297
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,080
fancy and i have no doubt that there is

298
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,330
a plugin because there's a plugin for

299
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,310
everything that will let you make a

300
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,680
little tag cloud over on the side so

301
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,360
jQuery teaches us how to do teaches

302
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,890
these newcomers how to do all these

303
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,900
things but they only want to build this

304
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,970
which is all those pieces turn together

305
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,390
they have no earthly clue what to do and

306
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,790
they end up using the same strategies

307
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,980
that they use to build this to build

308
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,350
this and the the people who are drawn to

309
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,250
jQuery i think i have a really hard time

310
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:38,459
looking at this and seeing how we could

311
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:42,779
get here from there but fundamentally

312
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,079
this is just a more advanced version of

313
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,120
this this is just dis with more features

314
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,160
and this is what i see happening is

315
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,930
people who started out building this

316
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,490
this was the original spec for their

317
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,410
application was was to just make this

318
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,420
simple little thing and they wrote it

319
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,120
that way that I showed you either at

320
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,529
their current company or at the new

321
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,089
company that hired them because they

322
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:04,700
said they knew how to write JavaScript

323
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,690
now they're being asked to build this

324
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,240
and now terrible terrible things are

325
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,740
happening

326
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,960
it people have no idea about JavaScript

327
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,240
or like that's the best picture they

328
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,990
love it so yeah it turns out that J

329
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,380
queries approach to mildly complicated

330
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,820
problems let alone like actually

331
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,510
complicated problems is terrible and

332
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,750
people these newcomers are learning bad

333
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,490
habits that they are really preventing

334
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,320
them from they're trying to you know

335
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,380
stick knives in power outlets basically

336
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,940
and I'm not telling you anything you

337
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,220
don't know here but this slide will be

338
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,870
in there for the people who see this on

339
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,110
SlideShare tonight when we're building

340
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,850
applications we have to actually think

341
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,970
about components we have to think about

342
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,530
loose coupling we have to think about

343
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,330
how do we dry it out so we're not

344
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,660
writing the same one that was I hadn't

345
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,950
looked at that code until earlier today

346
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,310
and I was like wow it's me fun email the

347
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,290
right on Monday we have to think about

348
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,910
components that work with each other

349
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,170
without depending on each other we have

350
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,880
to think about how can we drive stuff

351
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,410
out we have to think about how can we

352
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,660
communicate between components without

353
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,050
having them be completely tied into each

354
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,030
other and we have to think about how can

355
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,760
we actually grow that simple search

356
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,890
application into something more

357
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,740
complicated because that's the use case

358
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,240
that's happening over and over and over

359
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,690
again people come to JavaScript to show

360
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,000
and hide some stuff or out of menu or

361
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,890
add a little bit of Ajax they've arrived

362
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,540
at jQuery to do that and now the knees

363
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,680
just keep growing and growing and

364
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,420
growing and at no point do they step

365
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,670
back and say I might not know what I

366
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,910
need to know to do this so here's a

367
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,650
simple little rewrite how we might

368
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,160
rewrite the search results portion of

369
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,530
that application to actually be reusable

370
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,990
and actually be a component and not be

371
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,310
tied in to not be so dependent on

372
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,460
dependent directly on the input into the

373
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,740
search box it's obviously this in and of

374
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,350
itself is almost as long as the simple

375
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,020
little code for for making the first

376
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,430
version of the app but

377
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,890
this is where I want to see people going

378
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,420
this is how I want to start encouraging

379
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,330
people to think about these slightly

380
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,910
more complex problems I'm not saying

381
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,730
like that James Bergstrom is is the

382
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,890
answer to everything i'm not i don't

383
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,500
want to get too much into and this is

384
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,160
how you should do it I've seen lots of

385
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,080
different approaches to this but the

386
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,149
main point is that we have to be

387
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,190
thoughtful the other main point is this

388
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,540
scares the hell out of the client

389
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,420
because and and the database guy he's

390
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,089
like what is that I knew this told get

391
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,550
some elements and do something with them

392
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:04,080
but wow so this is the part that is

393
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,740
really for this audience I think that

394
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,380
instead of being judgmental towards

395
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,270
these people and instead of saying well

396
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,860
you know people who don't poach

397
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,250
shouldn't be coding we should just eject

398
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,720
them kick them off the island it's not

399
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,920
going to it's not going to happen we

400
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,990
can't just shake our fingers at them and

401
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,839
say rtfm there's there's no manual on

402
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,910
this we're still making this up in some

403
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,860
ways we're still figuring out how we do

404
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,440
build large applications or non-trivial

405
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,750
applications we're still figuring out as

406
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,400
a community how we manage dependencies

407
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,810
and how we structure our code and

408
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,890
there's different answers for different

409
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,230
questions so I don't think that we can

410
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,670
get that upset at the at the people

411
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,170
making these decisions they're just

412
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,089
they're just doing their job and they're

413
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:49,380
just trying to do the best they can do

414
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,160
what I do think that we can do is be

415
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,830
more proactive about exposing them to

416
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,680
these more complicated concepts be more

417
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,390
proactive about letting them know what

418
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,660
it is they don't know so that the the

419
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,650
jQuery get some elements and do

420
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,720
something with them doesn't dominate the

421
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,550
conversation so much and I think that

422
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,260
this is not just an altruistic thing

423
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,760
this is not just me saying we should be

424
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,890
better people and help our friends I

425
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,260
think that there are actual impact that

426
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,620
I hear about among other developers from

427
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,590
people taking these uninformed

428
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,169
approaches there's a friend of mine who

429
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,390
works at a very very large media company

430
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,750
who

431
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,570
is really struggling with decisions that

432
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,070
were made a couple of years ago and they

433
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,830
are having to the decision to use jQuery

434
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,540
a couple years ago and they're having to

435
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,540
really evaluate how they're going to

436
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,270
proceed because they have created such a

437
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,270
mess so there's there's we should help

438
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,980
our friends he's a smart guy but he's

439
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,330
working with a bunch of people who

440
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,770
didn't necessarily know what they were

441
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,020
doing and now what so we should be

442
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,840
helping our friends number two I think

443
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,050
that the perception of javascript is

444
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:12,930
diminished when we allow there to be bad

445
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,970
code and don't do anything about it when

446
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,760
we allow people to claim expertise and

447
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,710
don't do anything about and I don't

448
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,180
think the thing to do about it is to say

449
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,100
you know stop doing that the thing to do

450
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,350
about is to help educate them and this

451
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,760
is the number one thing that we need to

452
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,100
explain to them I think this is jQuery

453
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,320
and this is JavaScript and if jquery

454
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,470
would just put this on their homepage

455
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,640
probably self like thirty percent of the

456
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,280
problem probably not that's a lie

457
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,630
companies are looking for JavaScript

458
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,490
developers i do not know an unemployed

459
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,140
JavaScript developer I don't know I get

460
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,180
recruiter emails from like crazy

461
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,320
regularly I'm not interested in moving

462
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,150
to the bay no how many times do I have

463
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,270
to tell you this and we all do get these

464
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,830
emails from people people are desperate

465
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,620
for JavaScript developers this is

466
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,090
JavaScript Ruby PHP and Python I was

467
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,860
actually kind of shocked to see that

468
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,910
graph but God people are looking for

469
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,320
JavaScript developers and they're going

470
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,610
to hire them whether they're good or not

471
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,930
because they've got seats to fill they

472
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,370
have they have jobs that they need done

473
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,530
and they're going to get good people to

474
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,880
do it that what they're aren't good

475
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,340
there aren't enough good people that's

476
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,690
kind of the problem there aren't enough

477
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,270
good people and so they're going to get

478
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,090
bad people to do it and that's not good

479
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,280
for us as a community so Aaron Newton

480
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,050
wrote a blog post a few weeks ago about

481
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,390
how he's been searching for a JavaScript

482
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,440
developer at Cloudera and talking to a

483
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,220
recruiter evil people talking to a

484
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,210
recruiter and

485
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,350
and the recruiter saying these people

486
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,630
that you want don't exist they don't

487
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,030
exist and you know he had some pretty

488
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,140
high expectations from from his his

489
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,900
posting these people don't exist and

490
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,550
again I think the answer to that is not

491
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,820
to you know his post was like something

492
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,440
about how hard it is to find badass

493
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,200
JavaScript developers and the productive

494
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,820
reaction to this is not to say well

495
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,140
aren't I lucky that I'm a badass

496
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,300
JavaScript developer and all those other

497
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,420
people can just you know go to hell the

498
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,520
productive answer to this is is to say

499
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,050
how do we how do we help them how do we

500
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,340
fix this because these are the people

501
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,360
that you're going to be working with on

502
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,000
some job and then your future and you're

503
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,500
going to be sad so Jake we is is is

504
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,300
drawing in crazy amounts of people into

505
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,270
this JavaScript community and the

506
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,980
applications that are writing look a

507
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,110
whole lot like this there's lots of

508
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,120
disparate pieces no organizing principle

509
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,660
lots of pieces that are fun you know it

510
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,470
slide show lots of uses that are fun but

511
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,970
the pieces aren't made to work together

512
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,150
unless you have a fairly talented

513
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,890
developer what I want is for us to be

514
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,840
encouraging people to make applications

515
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,120
that look like this Nicole beat me to

516
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,850
the Legos so yeah lame no but javascript

517
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,320
will be better off when newcomers are

518
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,930
thinking about applications as a bunch

519
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,290
of pieces that work together and instead

520
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,510
of a bunch of pieces that they just

521
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,980
assemble and copy and paste and through

522
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,420
under their application so there are i

523
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,430
came up with kind of five things that i

524
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,740
think we as a community could be doing

525
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,340
better to help address this problem and

526
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,780
we're not going to solve it there are

527
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,200
always going to be just hopeless people

528
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,870
who are coming to javascript to solve

529
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,900
some problem and we can't help everybody

530
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,750
i know that i don't want to sound all

531
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,510
Pollyanna about it so yes there will

532
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,130
always be hopeless people but I think

533
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,650
there are people who just need a nudge

534
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,140
in the right direction and so here are

535
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,090
five things that I think that we can be

536
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,290
doing to as a community give that nudge

537
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,490
number

538
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,320
on that graph that I showed you earlier

539
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,260
of jquery's popularity it is a

540
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,590
decision-making tool for the deciders at

541
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,130
companies and this is not okay and I

542
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,780
think as a community we need to be much

543
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,020
more vocal about the fact that this

544
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,780
graph is about as meaningful as this

545
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,309
graph this graph compares you can read

546
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:34,910
it never mind so yeah these are both

547
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,929
dumb they tell you nothing hey gay porn

548
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:44,570
I tried to find a picture to illustrate

549
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:50,630
that and just decided not to um you

550
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,630
haven't searched for food porn on Google

551
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:59,120
you have no idea Wow bacon though please

552
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,650
figures very prominently into that so I

553
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,260
think that as a community we've got to

554
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,630
be this is this is the thing that gets

555
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,880
me all worked up we have got to be

556
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,350
intellectually honest when we're having

557
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,380
these conversations about you know what

558
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,240
is the best library there is no best

559
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,190
library there is the right library for

560
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,740
your use case there is no best library

561
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,179
and when somebody asks on stack overflow

562
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:25,760
and when somebody asks on Quora we need

563
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,870
to be very clear about the how we

564
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,730
actually come to those decisions that we

565
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,260
don't come to those decisions based on a

566
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,010
graph and I think that when people

567
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,360
reference the graph as part of an

568
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,580
argument about why their library might

569
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,309
be better than another we need to make

570
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:46,040
clear that then among us among those of

571
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,330
us who are actually thoughtful about

572
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,550
this that is not a legitimate argument

573
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,190
and it's not helping the conversation

574
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,490
it's not helping javascript progress

575
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,840
that's probably my most political thing

576
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,910
that I'm going to say but I feel I get

577
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,720
pretty bent when I when I see people

578
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,309
reference that as sort of the argument

579
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,640
ending graph that says well jquery is

580
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,250
clearly better there are times when

581
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,559
jQuery is a wonderful solution and in

582
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,300
the hands of good developers jquery can

583
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,930
be a wonderful

584
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,730
solution but there's a lot more to

585
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,190
picking a library than looking at up

586
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,570
looking at a graph oh dear when I was a

587
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,910
kid I used to make headphones out of a

588
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,370
coat hanger and wrap masking tape around

589
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,250
it and so this is like I have arrived

590
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,620
that was so fun when I was three and now

591
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:39,230
it's really it works it's amazing number

592
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,580
two I think that we need to encourage

593
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,560
people to be choosing tools not API is

594
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,410
in David Walsh who's a mood tools guy

595
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,910
who's now working at site pen and doing

596
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,710
a lot of work with dojo has written

597
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,740
about this and done some some

598
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,850
demonstrations of how the of the

599
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,170
different API is that the different tool

600
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,660
kits have and and just talked a little

601
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,040
bit about how api's are they're friendly

602
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,450
they're great you know Jake where's API

603
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,030
is awesome but that is not a really good

604
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,950
way to be picking a library we can

605
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,070
either learn another API because it's

606
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:15,380
not that hard or we can maybe wrap to

607
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,180
the API that we don't like in an API

608
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,250
that we do that's what dojo is done it's

609
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,100
done with plug d and dojo even has a

610
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,190
shim that will provide almost the entire

611
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,510
API of jQuery 132 and then they changed

612
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,480
their API in 142 so they got to go ahead

613
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,600
and do all that again but yeah so yeah

614
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,560
jQuery is short and sexy and awesome but

615
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,150
we're smart people we can figure out

616
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,070
that these things all mean the same

617
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,450
thing and I think that we can also

618
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,830
actually educate people that these

619
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,390
things mean the same thing but more

620
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,380
importantly we need to to let people

621
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,180
know that ap the API of a tool is but a

622
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,090
small piece of it this is the original

623
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,270
example I showed for that basic basic

624
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,490
search up and this is the same thing

625
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,840
written in dojo and those of you in the

626
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,970
back I mean the indentations all the

627
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,200
same and a lot of the words are the same

628
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,880
you probably can't even tell the

629
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,830
difference so we're smart enough to

630
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,500
figure these differences out we

631
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,300
shouldn't be intimidated by them and we

632
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,680
should be encouraging other people not

633
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,400
to be intimidated by them either sort of

634
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,590
as a corollary to the point number one

635
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,460
about the grab

636
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,830
I think that we need to be more doing a

637
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,790
better job of explaining how to evaluate

638
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,950
the question before we come up with the

639
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,650
answer and we all know that clients are

640
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,360
bosses or whoever they like to do this

641
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,750
like we should use html5 why I don't

642
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,490
know I just heard about it on NPR and it

643
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:55,160
sounds really cool so yeah html5 is on

644
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,680
NPR in americo's they talked about the

645
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,160
arcade fire thing was wild so we need to

646
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,170
be talking more about how we make these

647
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,240
decisions because this is dumb but

648
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,320
lemmings was an awesome game decision

649
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,240
makers need help making actual decisions

650
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,720
and I'm going to my my timer says I have

651
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,220
three minutes and 35 seconds and

652
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,240
counting so I'm going to go through

653
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,000
these really fast number one we have to

654
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,380
understand the project understand the

655
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,050
team understand the life cycle of the

656
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,440
project because those are are pretty

657
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,930
important decision points for what sort

658
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,820
of tool and how robust and approach is

659
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,190
going to make sense number two we need

660
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,710
to assess the actual applications needs

661
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,120
do are we going to need dependency

662
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,630
management is it going to have a lot of

663
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,910
similar but but not exactly the same

664
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,620
codes are we going to need some sort of

665
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,180
module system or some sort of inherited

666
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,400
system are we going to need templated

667
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,210
widgets are we going to be

668
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,590
internationalizing this is that a

669
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,670
question we're going to have to address

670
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,370
and only then once we answer those

671
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,930
questions on those two slides that I

672
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,120
just went through really fast only then

673
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,140
should we be choosing our tools and I

674
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,600
think that that formalizing this I hope

675
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,040
to write it I hoped to write a blog post

676
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,420
about this on the plane here and I

677
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,930
didn't because it was 80 degrees and

678
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,400
they only brought me one gin and tonic

679
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,150
the whole time but i think that

680
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,280
formalizing this decision making process

681
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,140
is is something that we as a community

682
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,400
can do a little bit better and be

683
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,900
educating people about a little bit more

684
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,090
number four there are lots of times when

685
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,450
rtfm is a great answer this isn't one of

686
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,340
them what I'm talking about again there

687
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,740
is no manual here we can't tell people

688
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,650
to go look it up in the docks there

689
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,900
there

690
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,380
aren't docs that give a

691
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,000
one-size-fits-all answer to these

692
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,220
questions of how do you structure a

693
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,720
large application and how do you deal

694
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,360
with the the problems that you confront

695
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,070
once get some elements and do something

696
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,850
with them stops being effective and a

697
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,270
commenter on Aaron Newton's post about

698
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,140
finding a unicorn said the this person

699
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,640
said it's really difficult to find good

700
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,960
resources and I think that they're right

701
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,390
and I heard another conversation just a

702
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,980
little while ago somebody's saying the

703
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,540
same thing that's it can be difficult to

704
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,430
find good resources we can't point

705
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,040
people to the MDC that's overwhelming

706
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,580
and crazy we can point people to books

707
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,770
but a lot of people are going to read

708
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,590
your book and just like I didn't know

709
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,380
such a thin book could be so hard so I

710
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,130
think that that we need to this is a

711
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,360
problem that's going to require a little

712
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,000
bit more one-on-one or a little bit more

713
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,910
interactive problem-solving than just

714
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,770
sending people to read the manual and

715
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,090
unfortunately that was that was the

716
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,850
answer to this guy was you know read my

717
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,960
blog posts I did it so can you and and I

718
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,810
think that the we need to be a little

719
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,010
bit more proactive a little bit more

720
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,530
sensitive to to the fact that these are

721
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,210
challenging questions and of the fact

722
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,650
that different people learn differently

723
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,400
you know I teach jquery classes and I'm

724
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,030
always a little bit mystified like you

725
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,790
need me to come and read the manual to

726
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:15,000
you okay you know I get paid for that

727
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,990
but different I have to remind myself

728
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,700
that different people learn differently

729
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,650
and so we can't just dismiss them and

730
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,970
say that this is their problem i really

731
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,580
do think it's a problem that we as a

732
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,220
community need to address 20 10 seconds

733
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,530
um fifth and finally I think that we as

734
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,270
a community have been struggling with

735
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,860
these questions and these problems for a

736
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,000
couple of years and some of us are

737
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,390
solving them really well now and we as

738
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,000
you knew much guilty pleasures we might

739
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,470
get out of making people suffer through

740
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,020
the same things that we suffered through

741
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,029
it's not nice

742
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:57,039
we shouldn't make people suffer through

743
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,470
the same discovery process that we did

744
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,140
of what these big questions are there

745
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,269
was a time when Dom Ajax adenosine

746
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:05,980
effects were the big questions and those

747
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,809
those new jquery was absolutely

748
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:09,820
revolutionary for the fact that it

749
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,039
helped solve those so cleanly and

750
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,779
pleasantly those aren't the big

751
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:16,000
questions anymore various libraries have

752
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,529
saw them in various ways we need to be

753
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:19,630
talking about now what are the what are

754
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,409
the bigger questions and so some things

755
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:27,190
that I'm trying to do to address this

756
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,130
number one someday we'll make a new yay

757
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,419
query I swear to God Paul says yes I

758
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:37,210
think that was a real a real success we

759
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,190
put out about 18 episodes of HOD cast

760
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,260
talking about jQuery and front-end

761
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,760
development and I think that it did a

762
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,029
really good job of with humor and

763
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:49,840
singing and stupidity talking about some

764
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,399
of the more advanced questions that we

765
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:53,830
might want to be that we wanted people

766
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,230
who were writing jquery to be dealing

767
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,409
with and I mean that was fun we drank

768
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:04,360
and swore and made up silly songs so

769
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,669
this doesn't have to suck this can

770
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:10,779
actually be fun number two of we the Y a

771
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,639
query team put together a conference in

772
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:18,850
texas texas united states last in june

773
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,909
and that was another effort that i think

774
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:25,090
was successful in making people like

775
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,279
Doug Crockford and Pete Higgins and

776
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,110
Brian LaRue and Tom crusher making them

777
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,820
available to an audience more more

778
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,409
diverse less skilled in this audience

779
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:36,850
and I think that's an important thing to

780
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,700
be doing making sure that people have

781
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,830
access to the smart people in the field

782
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,990
this is great java the JS comp is

783
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,330
amazing and i feel really lucky to be

784
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,669
here to be part of this small small

785
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,860
gathering but i think that as a

786
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,740
community we need to be doing a better

787
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,519
job of reaching out to the people who

788
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,769
aren't as tuned in and so they don't

789
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,929
know that they have eight minutes to buy

790
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:05,680
a ticket before they're all sold out

791
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,760
and there's other there's other good

792
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,830
resources Microsoft script junkie as

793
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,100
much as I mock it is actually kind of a

794
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,580
useful resource for for reaching a wider

795
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,440
audience and so I applaud them for doing

796
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,110
that I wish they had comments that would

797
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:28,040
be nice and and people often ask me like

798
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,660
so is this are you saying this is Jake

799
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,240
worries fault no this is not jquery so

800
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,950
jQuery is an open source project with

801
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,310
limited resources a small dedicated team

802
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:41,110
they're doing the best that they can

803
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,340
there are things that I'm English that

804
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,730
they were doing differently there are

805
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,160
there if time and money were no object

806
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,590
certainly there are things that jQuery

807
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,110
could do to address this but I think as

808
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,940
a larger community it's up to us to be

809
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,070
grateful to what job jquery has

810
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,710
contributed to the community be excited

811
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,980
about the fact that it's bringing

812
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,660
ridiculous numbers of potentially good

813
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,570
developers to the community and then

814
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,120
take them by the hand and actually make
