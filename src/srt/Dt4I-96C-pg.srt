1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,080

damn good too but you can't be any geek

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,750
off the street gotta be handy with the

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,010
steel if you know what I'm a nerd you

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:20,070
keep yeah you're like gonna do a

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,869
soundcheck we're going I'll say yeah for

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,519
sure and then that just mucked up that

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:31,470
whole entire opening today yes okay it's

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,960
Friday evening we are gonna get ready

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,280
come on

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,040
I feel like it's a half-empty house yeah

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,620
my name is Ruth they flew me in to play

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,320
hip hop they've done that thank you very

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,860
much I know very disclaimer I kind of

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,020
done it already that is sound and there

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,870
is flashing visuals in this talk I will

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,010
try and warn you when they do you get

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,160
super flashy but yes just if you don't

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,649
like it look away leave I won't be I

19
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,799
won't be offended honestly so yes my

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,840
name is Ruth this is the part of the

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,080
talk where people introduce themselves

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,430
they tell you what they've done who they

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,010
work for why they should be on stage

24
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,750
teaching you or telling you about a

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,590
certain thing except etc I'm gonna show

26
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,590
you that's the easiest way because I'm

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,130
here to talk to you about how to be a

28
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:34,200
web AV artist what exactly right AV by

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
the way stands for audio vision I'll get

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,350
back to to that in a minute

31
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,229
but yeah I struggle with the

32
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:42,750
practicality of this talk like how many

33
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,240
of you are gonna go back into your jobs

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,390
on Monday and just code some AV into

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,420
your website or your web app right

36
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,009
I have no better talk anxiety and I came

37
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,280
across this helpful Venn diagram on

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,420
Twitter which is also helpful and what

39
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,729
it is it's on the left you've got what

40
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,560
people talk about in conference talks

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,050
which isn't so helpful and on the right

42
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,700
you've got what you want to hear in

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,120
conference talks which is how

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,280
so I've taken this quite literally and

45
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,550
I've made myself two lists okay so on

46
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,380
the Left I've got things that I need to

47
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,200
avoid and on the right I've got things

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,060
that I need to include so on the Left

49
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,390
I've got analytics operational

50
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,750
excellence chat opps and orchestration

51
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,819
those are the things that I have to

52
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,280
avoid in this talk to make this a useful

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,470
talk but I do have to include duct-tape

54
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,800
workarounds bike shedding and coffee

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,709
right okay now my talk anxiety is out

56
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,160
the way we can again by the way I'm

57
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,739
losing a joy Khan this could break at

58
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,690
any time okay so Amy what is an AV

59
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,720
artist a V stands for audio

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,069
visualization okay so what we're doing

61
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:06,500
is we're taking audio and we're making

62
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,810
visualizations from it so it's not so

63
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,850
much of the creating audio as it is

64
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,980
creating visualizations based on the

65
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,080
audio that we have another name for this

66
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,650
is Vijay got control of my audio so this

67
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,470
is pretty loud who remembers this I was

68
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,209
like I'm gonna do that again because I

69
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,820
was like um I got old audio all the way

70
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,440
through this talk please don't turn down

71
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,720
the levels who remembers this oh my

72
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,989
goodness no working is it there is a

73
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:41,000
sound bite for that I'm gonna try it one

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,810
more time one more time audio people

75
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,180
because it's pretty cool we're there now

76
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:55,340
it really whips the llamas ass thank you

77
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,170
oh can we keep the audio levels up for

78
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,160
the rest of the tour please there is

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,450
audio where they do this talk thank you

80
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,989
very much we ramp the greatest mp3

81
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:05,359
player of all time right for those of

82
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:08,269
you that don't know when I'm because I'm

83
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,700
of a certain age it basically just plays

84
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,670
mp3 and other audio files when we used

85
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,039
to listen to audio files and not stream

86
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,630
them like we used to own the files we

87
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,870
used to share them via Napster right but

88
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,460
this wasn't the best thing about winner

89
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,620
no no the best thing about winner was

90
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,440
this it had a visualization

91
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,020
engine right so you can play your music

92
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,900
and you'd whip this up and all these

93
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,310
visuals would go in time to the music

94
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,620
and you just sit and watch this for

95
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,360
hours I said this is probably the most

96
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,520
influential thing of any VJ of my

97
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,840
generation um so I was thinking a few

98
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,670
years ago say okay we've got some cool

99
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,860
browser api's now what if I could do

100
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,990
this in a browser good idea I'm gonna

101
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,540
take you to some ways that I have come

102
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,190
to actually be able to do this in a

103
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,890
browser the first thing that we need is

104
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,210
audio right we have a Web Audio API and

105
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,910
there's probably yes it's my favorite

106
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,450
one too

107
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,040
there's sort of four main ways to get

108
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,440
audio with the Web Audio API you can

109
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,910
grab it from the DOM if you've got a

110
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,160
video or an audio element in your Dom

111
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,200
you could just grab the audio from that

112
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,120
and you can push it through the API and

113
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
you can stream it from your device if

114
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,230
you've got a camera microphone you can

115
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,730
grab the audio from that and you can

116
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,460
stream it through the API you can go and

117
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,780
get a file you can go and get a sound

118
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,030
file when you get a sound file you do

119
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,950
have to decode it into the API you sort

120
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,660
of got to buffer it in because sound

121
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,830
files by and large are sort of

122
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,450
compressed and you've got to make the

123
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,130
audio api understand the data of the

124
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,900
sound file so we decode it into what we

125
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,730
call a buffer and then we can use that

126
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,150
data you can also create sounds the Web

127
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,040
Audio API so here I'm using an

128
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,600
oscillator to create a sound which is

129
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,970
creating a sound wave you can also use

130
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,919
that but at buffer that I just mentioned

131
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,410
earlier and you can put your own data

132
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,000
into that so you can create things like

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,440
white noise quite easily which is just

134
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,440
random numbers and the ones that I'm

135
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,720
sort of interested in either like using

136
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,380
a sound file so this example uses a

137
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:18,460
sound file

138
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,669
and this one's actually just picking up

139
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,840
on my mic so this one is me it gets very

140
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,520
quiet then it gets really loud yeah the

141
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,350
next thing that we need now that we've

142
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,090
got some sound is we need to analyze

143
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,990
that sound ha ha I wasn't allowed to

144
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,050
talk about analytics it's okay we've got

145
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,639
a whole rest of the tour to go it's fine

146
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,720
we'll be fine

147
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,800
ok ok we need to analyze that sound

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,360
because we want to use that data to make

149
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,210
our visualizations that's cool we can do

150
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,520
that with the Web Audio API as well it

151
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,070
has the functionality for you to be able

152
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,350
to analyze any sound that it's in it

153
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,020
right what we're doing here is we're

154
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,000
creating analyzer node a lot of the Web

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,830
Audio API is sort of based around this

156
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,110
idea of nodes I'm not going to go into

157
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,750
too much detail about it now but if you

158
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,460
do want to know more about a Web Audio

159
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,560
API come and talk to me later

160
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,060
I would tell you all about it um

161
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,550
somebody wrote some cool stuff on env

162
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,410
and Doc's about it so you can go there

163
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,419
there's some cool demos now and there's

164
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,919
plenty of resources out there and I can

165
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,410
point you in the right direction what

166
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,470
the analyzer node gives us back is an

167
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,130
array of data now that data is the

168
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,210
frequency amplitudes I know right it's

169
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,900
basically it's the low sounds all the

170
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,000
way through to the high sounds and the

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,699
sort of volume value of all those sounds

172
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,760
at any given point so the first few

173
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,590
items in the array are going to be the

174
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,360
low sounds and the last few items in

175
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,260
that array are going to be the higher

176
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,539
sounds and the data in that item of the

177
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,400
array is just gonna be the volume value

178
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,550
right and then we can use that to make

179
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,639
our visualizations so here all I've got

180
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,320
is a bunch of elements in the DOM and

181
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,910
I'm just taking those values and

182
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,340
changing the height of those elements

183
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,870
based on what I'm getting back from that

184
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,900
analysis if it's gone yet HTML CSS

185
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,030
really simple took me about two months

186
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,770
so just leaping over those elements and

187
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,159
I'm just changing the height of them now

188
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,020
this is the sort of crux of everything

189
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,700
once you've got that an

190
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,010
is going on you're getting that data

191
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,000
everything becomes a little bit easier

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,300
so so I started a whole bunch of

193
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,010
experiments now everything everybody

194
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,600
knows when you start a bunch of

195
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
experiments you need some inspiration

196
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,130
this is my inspiration for my first

197
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,110
bunch of experiments this is a super

198
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,510
cool artist Bridget Riley you know she's

199
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,010
a super cool artist cuz it says on the

200
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,540
slide I saw her exhibition and she makes

201
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,050
a new Pacey's huge pictures of shapes

202
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,600
and she experiments herself with these

203
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,820
shapes and I just was walking around I

204
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,410
said oh I've got to try visualizing

205
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,420
these these are really really good so

206
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,160
this is the first one this is just a

207
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,740
whole bunch of sections and they were

208
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,760
just they were all kind of long just set

209
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,410
out with flexbox and I'm just changing

210
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,060
the width of them based on the data that

211
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,310
I'm going back

212
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,620
this one is that triangle CSS border

213
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,360
hack that you've seen and I'm just

214
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,030
changing the opacity of them again based

215
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,890
on that sort of numbers that I'm getting

216
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,850
back from the analysis data when you do

217
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,250
when you start experimenting it gives

218
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,900
you a good opportunity to try any things

219
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,820
this is a couple of years ago and I'm

220
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,590
sort of thinking you know how else can

221
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,450
we expand this and one of the things

222
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,670
that I really wanted to try was some

223
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,170
transforms and getting familiar with

224
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,180
those and I thought wouldn't it be nice

225
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,860
if you could take whatever you have in

226
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,150
there Dom because I'm still working with

227
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,760
just dorm elements and sort of copy it

228
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,720
and rotate and reflect it around the

229
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,340
rest the Dom so you shrink it down and

230
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,400
you just copy copy it around like like

231
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,910
this right so this is only one square

232
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,500
and I'm just running a little JavaScript

233
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,210
function to copy that and then I'm just

234
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,700
reflecting and rotating it around and I

235
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,170
thought hey this is just stuff in the

236
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,630
Dom so um I mean this is my competitive

237
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,400
elements but you know you can drop

238
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,110
anything into the Dom maybe I could just

239
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,260
drop an animated gif into the Dom yeah

240
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,110
you could do that too might look Pony

241
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,250
gifts and we've got so cool like

242
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,160
visualizations and some other lovely CSS

243
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,600
things because I've come to a JavaScript

244
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,620
conference so I thought I'd talk about

245
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,170
CSS that I wanted to try with blend

246
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,480
modes and filters say blend modes if you

247
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,400
are unsure I just you can sort of see

248
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,920
through

249
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,660
like elements underneath in different

250
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,310
ways you can darken you can lighten them

251
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,200
and filters which will become more

252
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,850
apparent a bit later and so you can

253
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,290
invert stuff you can turn things

254
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,630
grayscale you can blur them all really

255
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,300
cool visual things and browser this is a

256
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,970
visualization I did for jazz company you

257
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,010
and I by this point I'm starting to move

258
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,800
over to SVG's so these are all SVG

259
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,170
shapes and you can put blend filter like

260
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,199
blend mode on SVG's and I'm just putting

261
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,180
like a lighting mode on these because it

262
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,620
becomes just a little bit brighter and

263
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,550
it just gives it a little bit more depth

264
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,820
one more sort of CSS thing custom

265
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,889
properties I'm sure we've probably all

266
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:20,079
seen them we probably are all using them

267
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,820
now and this is the idea of sort of

268
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,540
variables in CSS right so you declare

269
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,339
the variable that you want to use your

270
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:29,199
custom property you do that in a Dom

271
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,389
element further at the tree so we've got

272
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:32,949
a dash dash level so as long as you

273
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:34,510
start it with - - and call it whatever

274
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,579
you want I've got a level here I'm

275
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,740
setting it to a default value and then

276
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,269
I'm using that value under the

277
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,709
property's width and height later on in

278
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,649
my CSS now the thing about custom

279
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,089
property is a really good thing which I

280
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,279
was enjoying is you can update them in

281
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,949
real time right they're not set at

282
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:53,410
runtime you can you can just update them

283
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,730
in the browser and they will update and

284
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,820
you can do this with JavaScript so in my

285
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,160
JavaScript I can take that analysis

286
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,500
value and pipe it straight into that

287
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,970
custom property and it will update my

288
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,390
CSS for me in real time this JavaScript

289
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,920
all up in your CSS so here I've got like

290
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,490
document.documentelement style set

291
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,070
property and I'm setting - - level with

292
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,870
that analysis level that I'm getting

293
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,649
back so this is an example of me doing

294
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:24,430
all of those things we've got some Dom

295
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,050
elements they're being rotated and

296
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,519
reflective got some blend modes going on

297
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,470
I'm doing some custom properties and as

298
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,810
you can see it's a little bit janky it

299
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,740
kinda doesn't like operate very well to

300
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,730
talk about operational excellence - cave

301
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,490
- down what this can still go either way

302
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,750
so thinking about the performance of all

303
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,040
of this and this is my friend Ben

304
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,570
if you don't take anything else away

305
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,070
from this talk because I'm talking about

306
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,440
making crazy visualizations in a browser

307
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,090
talk to your friends about things and

308
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,680
not just for rubber ducky

309
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,140
bugs but your actual project because

310
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,110
they might have some other better ideas

311
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,960
so I was chatting to been not allowed to

312
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,060
talk about chops oh my goodness me that

313
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,680
was like - in like two minutes

314
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,470
Oh orchestration I'll make it useful -

315
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,940
so I was talking to Ben

316
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,100
we were team this is this is all going

317
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,090
to the realm of doing something quite

318
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,110
interactive with it

319
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,730
and he made the good point he's sort of

320
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,620
saying well you're doing a lot of stuff

321
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,600
with SVG's you're doing a lot of stuff

322
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,850
with data you're working with the Dom

323
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,320
yet you're kind of doing a lot of maths

324
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,040
have you thought about using d3 now

325
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,320
d3.js being the data visualization

326
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,570
library which back then I was thinking

327
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,330
yeah this is sort of pie charts I'm not

328
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,890
sure some people have done some

329
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,500
incredible stuff with d3 since but yeah

330
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,660
he had a point I'm doing lots of stuff

331
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,460
with data the analysis time getting back

332
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,160
from the audio is data I'm doing a lot

333
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,470
of work with the Dom and it's pretty

334
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,670
good at that it's pretty good at Dom

335
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,010
hoping I'm doing a lot of maths actually

336
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,740
a lot of the positioning things and

337
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,390
working things around and there's some

338
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,920
really nice features of d3 which which

339
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,810
deal with mass pretty well and I just

340
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,070
started working with SVG's and by

341
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,040
default that's how do you three works so

342
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,490
this begins my next set of experiments

343
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,350
this is a book by Tim Lyon called super

344
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,700
graphic it charts data from comics and

345
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,470
graphic novels if you like comics in

346
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,940
graphic novels I highly recommend it

347
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,440
it's really beautiful just a flick

348
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,300
through and so I was peeking through

349
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,710
this and I was like maybe I should try

350
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,600
and visualize some of these this looks

351
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,330
really cool this is a your basic

352
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,610
sunburst chart so again this is all

353
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,260
picking up on my mic so this is just me

354
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,330
speaking and sort of moving around as

355
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,480
I'm talking and I sort of started to

356
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,770
gain momentum this is a really cool of

357
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,620
waynebow this one looks good in a club

358
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,750
this one reimagines the spectrum from

359
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,340
earlier instead of doing lines and

360
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,110
landing circles and they're just going

361
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,230
diagonally across across the screen and

362
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,400
this one which is a little personal

363
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,570
favorite because it's kind of small

364
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,190
sweet it's very similar to the last one

365
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,540
you just got a little flower which is

366
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,870
just going around I'm all pretty it's

367
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,060
gonna stay easy nothing's easy but when

368
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,590
you're using d3 you're just sort of

369
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,450
copying and it's it is making things a

370
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,090
little bit easier

371
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,560
what do you three does is it takes each

372
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,660
item in the array and creates a shape

373
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,780
like an SVG SVG shape per item you get

374
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,970
to define that which is kind of what I

375
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,530
was doing with the Dom it's just I was

376
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,930
doing a little bit more work to do it

377
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,540
and one of the problems with this wasn't

378
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,520
D through and what d3 was doing it was

379
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,410
the data that I was getting back from

380
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,590
the Web Audio API I think the data could

381
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,380
have been better now this is gonna get a

382
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,820
little bit hard to explain and I'm gonna

383
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,940
try it anyway these frequency values

384
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,240
these sounds from low to high they run

385
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,770
from naught Hertz very low to 20,000

386
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,800
Hertz very high right this is what the

387
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,500
human ear hears I'm a little bit older

388
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,690
probably don't hear 20,000 Hertz now but

389
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,910
that's the data that we get back so

390
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,980
that's split up with however many items

391
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,210
that you want to put in that around you

392
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,940
get to define that but one of the issues

393
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,670
that we have with that as music doesn't

394
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,090
run that high music this is a musical

395
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,100
keyboard it probably sits around here on

396
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,990
that scale probably goes around up to

397
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,320
around 8,000 kilohertz so when you're

398
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,430
listening to music and you're analyzing

399
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,590
music there's a hole but there's a whole

400
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,940
bunch of items often this top end of the

401
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,570
array that you just don't need the other

402
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,460
problem when you're analyzing audio like

403
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,330
music audio is this we've got three

404
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,690
notes on this musical keyboard here

405
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,190
they're actually all the same note in

406
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,530
musical terms that will a but they are

407
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,470
all an octave apart so they're all eight

408
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,870
notes twelve semitones part equal spaces

409
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,280
apart and when you play them together

410
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,350
they're very very harmonious that's why

411
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,540
they will have the same letter but some

412
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,220
one low and got in mid one and we've got

413
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,920
a high one now they're equal spaces on

414
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,500
the keyboard but that middle key there

415
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,699
the orange one oh sure you can see the

416
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:08,290
orange that middle key I've highlighted

417
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,910
that's a middle a that runs at 440 Hertz

418
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,589
the one below it the one that's

419
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,079
highlighted below at the purple one 220

420
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,829
Hertz that's a

421
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,470
of 220 if I can still do maths on a

422
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,100
Friday um the one above it runs at 880

423
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,130
Hertz there's a gap of 440 you see what

424
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,169
happened the gaps doubled so even the

425
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:30,399
amount even though the amount of Keys

426
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:32,230
hasn't doubled the amount of frequency

427
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,870
Hertz has doubled so this is a problem

428
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,760
because the analysis that we get back

429
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,559
from the array from Web Audio is linear

430
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,740
and musical notes that really work in

431
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,470
linear so I thought it'd be really nice

432
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,230
if we had better analysis of the Web

433
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,289
Audio API so it chopped off the top of

434
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:52,630
the array that was pretty simple and

435
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,110
then I spread the rest of the data out

436
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,260
yeah magic function took me about six

437
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,690
months I haven't actually looked at this

438
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,730
for about a year cuz I just wrote it and

439
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,760
I left it's working this is great and

440
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,440
weirdly uh so we're looking at today and

441
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,299
I was just randomly doing some stuff

442
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,830
with WebGL recently I've been doing some

443
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,899
shade of stuff and I'm pretty sure that

444
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,130
there's some algorithms that I'm doing

445
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,779
with that which would actually make this

446
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:17,250
better

447
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,690
so there is a version of this online

448
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,159
that you can go and have a look at but

449
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,570
I'm hoping that I can refactor it to be

450
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,360
even better soon so that's what this is

451
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,830
doing and then just to prove that it

452
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:34,000
actually works this is before so we've

453
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,450
got on the right there is where the

454
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,279
shape starts so this is the lower end of

455
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,110
that right and you can say you that it's

456
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,380
there see it's bigger and then this is

457
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,760
after I run the functions

458
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,960
everything's just spread out a little

459
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,610
bit more and we've just got a better

460
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,669
amount of data

461
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,750
what about canvas so at the moment I'm

462
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,600
still using like SPG's and it's still

463
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,370
kind of a little bit heavier if I'm

464
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,990
honest and when I started putting more

465
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,340
items into that array and started

466
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,690
chucking more shapes into the DOM and

467
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,029
but I did start to see a lot more

468
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:08,860
performance problems d3 really wasn't

469
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,990
necessarily the answer so then I started

470
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,549
to work on 2d canvas which is the one

471
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:14,740
that you saw at the top of the talk and

472
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,779
this is a lot cleaner it does it like

473
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:18,100
it's kind of running because I'm running

474
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,080
so many things will happen right now but

475
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,309
when you run this alone this does work

476
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:22,990
better and I can just chuck so many

477
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,080
shapes and it's brilliant if you want to

478
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,840
see all of these they are on co pen most

479
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,160
of my co-founders audio-visual eyes

480
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,680
so you can see that journey from when we

481
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,380
sort of begin from not being able to do

482
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,970
very much all we have been doing some

483
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,560
canvas visualizations if you're

484
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:45,310
interested one last bit yeah this is

485
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,840
great we've got some visualizations but

486
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,990
to really be able to sort of bj2 a band

487
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,720
or like to DJ in a club which that would

488
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,550
be cool right I need to be able to

489
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,200
control these now I can probably control

490
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,420
them using the keyboard on my on my

491
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,240
laptop there are some other api's which

492
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,360
are fun like gamepad API is pretty fun

493
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,130
but like if I find it a little flaky

494
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,500
I'm really glad this is holding out it's

495
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,050
still holding out to go a web MIDI API

496
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,810
right we actually are able to run MIDI

497
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,270
in a browser I'm just a little bit about

498
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,980
meeting you just a little rundown and

499
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,050
it's not those beeping noises that you

500
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:25,020
hear right it is a data protocol so the

501
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,760
instruments can talk to each other it

502
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,830
was it came about because of the rise of

503
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,630
popularity of electronic instruments in

504
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,600
the 70s so in 1983 a group of industry

505
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,730
experts and electric electronic music

506
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,530
manufacturers got together and they put

507
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,540
together a specification you know an

508
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,570
open specification they're pretty cool

509
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,700
so these sort of electronic instruments

510
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,040
could sort of parse out data and they'll

511
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,160
be able to listen to each other this is

512
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,500
a MIDI enabled instrument this is the

513
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,000
musical keyboard we saw earlier and

514
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,320
probably show you for C Mon you're

515
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,640
producing a piano it's very very similar

516
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,960
the thing about this is it it's an

517
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,060
instrument because it has onboard audio

518
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,060
so when you play it you are listening to

519
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,490
sounds but it's also MIDI enabled so it

520
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,310
is passing out those that those data

521
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,350
messages so that it can orchestrate with

522
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,280
other instruments how could I do talk

523
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,990
about audio without talking about

524
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,380
orchestration it's okay I'm hoping that

525
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,730
at least at some point in this talk

526
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,050
you've got something useful out of it

527
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,450
never might so this is what an

528
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,100
instrument is and we talk about music

529
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,720
with MIDI instruments we're talking

530
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,100
about things that onboard audio on and

531
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,710
there's lots of these out there this is

532
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,530
a MIDI controller very similar and you

533
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,820
plug it into your computer you can pick

534
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,270
up on me

535
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,800
data that it's sending and but it

536
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,600
doesn't have any onboard audio this is

537
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,310
what I have with me today it's actually

538
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,930
one of these it's what we call a launch

539
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,550
pad great so basically I can press

540
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,400
button well I can run this code say what

541
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,500
you do in the browser is you you request

542
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,360
access to these many devices there's

543
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,740
lots and lots of MIDI controllers out

544
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,520
there by the way if you want to get

545
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,200
started just google MIDI controllers and

546
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,340
some of them are really really

547
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,110
affordable around sort of 30 bucks I

548
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,170
think from doing dollars and you just

549
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,900
plug it in and you request access to it

550
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,160
and then you can just listen for its

551
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,870
events and all you're getting back is

552
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,280
some data which you can then hook into

553
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,590
and you can do some stuff with so

554
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,080
hopefully if this is working working I'm

555
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,970
pressing buttons on this controller this

556
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,130
is the data that you get back it's just

557
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,330
some numbers and you can listen for

558
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,130
those numbers what they sort of mean is

559
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,260
I am this MIDI controller you're

560
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,170
pressing this button and for those like

561
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,370
there are some where you can press it

562
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,080
harder and you get different funnies you

563
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,630
don't on this one but you know just

564
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,860
pressing buttons I'm going getting

565
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,470
numbers and so this means that I'm going

566
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,300
to go flashing now so be aware this is

567
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,070
gonna get flashy this means I can sort

568
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,810
of easily add effects to these visuals

569
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,940
so we can go back and Y we can change

570
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,220
the colors and go blurry I can do

571
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,010
something vertie

572
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,690
but also it means that in the actual

573
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,450
thing that I use I can change what it is

574
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,540
I'm showing on screen I can actually mix

575
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,610
two visuals together with like you get

576
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,890
like cc's which are like dials so you

577
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,240
can actually mix things together in a

578
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,810
browser there's any of this real like

579
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,870
what are we doing oh like you know

580
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,970
analyzing audio making crazy

581
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,220
visualizations and plugging in boxes of

582
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,280
buttons um this is me with a portable VJ

583
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,670
pack I took a hand bag I put my laptop

584
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,100
in I've got like a mini projector take

585
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,750
one of MIDI controllers and I kind of

586
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,550
hacked the handbag so you can actually

587
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,290
unzip it in a certain way and it like

588
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,360
acts as an usherette tray and you can

589
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,440
just plug the little projector at the

590
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,580
bottom you can just walk around

591
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,830
projecting onto staff which is what I

592
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,200
did this is this is me doing in my in my

593
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,660
streets my city back in the UK and I

594
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,150
write a blog post about this and someone

595
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,470
on the Internet's found the blog post

596
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,450
because the Internet's are cool and they

597
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:55,650
say

598
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,450
I'm doing this tune I think what are you

599
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,720
doing and actually it's a whole group of

600
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,180
us doing it record low J s we don't just

601
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,680
do visuals there's a couple of people

602
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,620
out there that make software software

603
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,750
that plays music with JavaScript there's

604
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,710
a couple of people out there that

605
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,630
actually control whole lighting rigs

606
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,070
with software that they've built in

607
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,170
JavaScript if you want to check us out

608
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,020
on live Jay s Network we actually we pay

609
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,640
gigs which is slightly insane I think

610
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,020
but it works and we do it and it is

611
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,610
great fun and we talk to each other

612
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,530
about with a crazy technology that we

613
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,790
use and they're great people to talk to

614
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,190
and we also have a github repo so as far

615
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,320
as I'm concerned that must be real it's

616
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,630
the end of the story this was a couple

617
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,790
of years ago since then performance

618
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,950
still was an issue when you've got like

619
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,090
two canvases running because you're

620
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,650
mixing with them and you've got all

621
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,790
these shapes going on you're analyzing

622
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,860
that audio as well I started looking

623
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,780
into workers so web workers have been a

624
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,160
big help that's really helped with

625
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,530
performance

626
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,730
recently I started working with WebGL

627
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,559
which means I could be running

628
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,660
everything on a 3d context instead of a

629
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,090
2d context which means automatically on

630
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,440
a lot of hardware I will be on the GPU

631
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,090
instead of the CPU so that's been pretty

632
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,490
cool I also have been doing some stuff

633
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,960
for this code member because it's

634
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,240
November so if you want to check out

635
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,580
Mike opener as a whole bunch of audio

636
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,380
visualizations based on the genitive

637
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,809
asked artist recom which is a website

638
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,220
that Tim home and put up at the

639
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,690
beginning of this year and it just goes

640
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,530
through if you just want to do some

641
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,910
creative coding here just go through and

642
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,679
do some of his tutorials and just

643
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,970
there's some really nice generative art

644
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,600
tutorials I've got 40 seconds according

645
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,059
to that timer I want to address one last

646
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:37,230
thing before I go write this see I think

647
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,110
this is useful to look for the keen-eyed

648
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,300
among you you might have noticed the

649
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,760
whole Portofino pack held together with

650
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,300
duct tape

651
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,820
I lost audio again this kind of sucks

652
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,740
and I'm gonna turn it all the way up

653
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,350
okay yeah the poor Pavitra pack code

654
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:58,830
together with duct tape Ben is on a bike

655
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:10,460
around and most useful tour ever thank

656
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,930
you very much my name is reto and you

657
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,520
can find me at a tree Maira come and

658
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,810
talk to me after and talk about any of

659
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,050
this

660
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,850
the music in this is by a girl called at

661
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,010
Kanoa she's based in London check her

662
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,380
out on soundcloud thank you very much
