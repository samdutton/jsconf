[Music]

2
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm Shirley

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,070
you can find me on Twitter that's me I'm

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,869
gonna share with you about UI testing

5
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,600
today and you guys are saying is Papa

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,699
important it's really important because

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,189
your users use your service using the

8
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,000
user interface duh so if you have bugs

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,450
on your users you have - - users even s

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,540
users who make less money so your

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,719
testing is really important so the UI

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,329
testing is such a pain this is what UI

13
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,910
testing looks like today so many devices

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,020
so many browsers Oh a day so we totally

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,649
got a automate this right but automating

16
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,949
UI testing is also a pain because it is

17
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,989
what you guys testing scripts looks like

18
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,750
today so that's like a popular JSI read

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,729
nightmare dodge it and spend a little

20
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:06,299
bit time

21
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,140
look at it it's nothing you know while

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,549
to figure out what this that's right

23
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,350
it's just basically going to sometime go

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,320
to fight into a search for get to search

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,040
for nightmare dodge yes well there's a

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,070
lot of code smells in this it has hard

27
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,820
code IDs yes matching ways it is really

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,490
the ball so he really needs to be so you

29
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,920
know but we can really make this make

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
testing a lot better so I think this is

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,530
what that should really look like I go

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,650
to dark god calm eye surgeons computer I

33
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,880
press the Enter key and then I see HTTP

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,250
2018 James Caan's Asia is short

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,740
this is readable this has inherent

36
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,470
meaning is decoupled from your UI and it

37
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,530
is maintainable so this is the way we

38
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,180
are writing our tests right now users

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,640
developers specified objects we tested

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,460
up front no we shouldn't be doing that

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,470
have the test and Geney term in their

42
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,770
users could what to determine objects to

43
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,580
test at runtime so let's make testing

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,770
create again and this is what I'm

45
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,690
working on is called relations and this

46
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,860
is a pancake so let's show you a quick

47
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:28,800
demo okay so so this is the test which

48
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,810
I've written on your leashes what I'm

49
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,440
not going here is running on Chrome and

50
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,560
it's time to set up the test and you'll

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,330
see the test running on the right side

52
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,459
here with the screenshots I will just

53
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,850
tell you hey it works you know I'm going

54
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,720
to go home and just call Asia press

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,300
Enter key and I see the result there

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,790
that's wonderful but of course these GS

57
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,160
called Asia we gotta see some JavaScript

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,350
right so let's do something a little bit

59
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,209
more complicated and try to buy some

60
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,060
beer from red mark so I am the list here

61
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,180
of beer by Chun beer and Tiger leg

62
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,730
appeal and the complicated thing about

63
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,000
read my comments that there are many

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,830
buttons they're similar to each other in

65
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,100
macomb such as the Add to Cart button so

66
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,640
if I wanna say let's add the chung-kai

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,730
cable to the case to the cart I need to

68
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,380
say I see

69
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,510
Chun tiger beer and then I add it to

70
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,239
cart and then when I want to add a tiger

71
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:30,720
beer

72
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,470
I added I do a check to see the type of

73
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,209
yourself first and heading to college so

74
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,130
we can verify that this working here so

75
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,709

76
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,530
