00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,020

I have bare feet because I'm an old

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,170
hippie and I'm really nervous

3
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,539
hello Singapore what a charming place it

4
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,810
is it's my first time here I'm making

5
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,870
over 25 years a tour of all of Southeast

6
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,629
Asia so I just have Myanmar and Myanmar

7
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,940
and China to go now so thank you for

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,260
having me great food nice hotel I am

9
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,500
going to talk a lot so I'm going to do

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,850
it fast try not to fall asleep if you do

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,809
just ask me what you missed afterwards

12
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,420
buy me a beer tell me how much better I

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,989
am than Jake Archibald and it'd all be

14
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,080
good my talk is called if you're going

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,860
out of San Francisco the be sure to wear

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,820
web standards in your hair as I've said

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,030
I'm an old hippie and I made this slide

18
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,159
myself I'm available for freelance

19
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:27,540
design work if anybody needs me I'm here

20
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,409
to talk about war and peace I'm a hippie

21
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,530
I love peace peace guys I'm not talking

22
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,009
about you know huge devastating clashes

23
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,220
of civilizations I'm talking about you

24
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,040
know not not the really really important

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,390
things like this guy's icons I I fix

26
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,640
them for him yes we can talk later about

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,439
that I'm talking about holy wars holy

28
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,549
wars are kind of doctrinal clashes

29
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,090
between different sects of a religion

30
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,599
like Catholicism and Protestantism or

31
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,800
Shia and

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,310
that matter greatly hello man with a

33
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,100
camera mattered greatly to the people

34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,950
involved but to people outside its

35
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,440
really really incomprehensible I'm

36
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,420
talking about the kind of big questions

37
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,070
like Beatles or all the stones or big

38
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,820
macs or whoppers or Iron Maiden

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,880
or proper music sorry Jake we've had

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,030
many many wholly web wars ie versus

41
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,920
Netscape tables versus CSS jQuery versus

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,220
vanilla JavaScript angular versus embarr

43
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,550
and the vs. react all these kind of

44
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,240
things and there's a new holy war that I

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,709
am hoping to help solve today so we can

46
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,200
actually get away from holy wars and

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,190
factor on focus on the important things

48
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,930
the current holy war is about how to do

49
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,860
styling in component-based development

50
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,940
so one side says CSS is completely

51
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,890
unsuitable for styling modern web

52
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,890
applications and CSS in j/s is much

53
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,959
better because javascript is better and

54
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,670
anything that can be written in

55
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,170
javascript should be written in

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,060
javascript and that's true because Jeff

57
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,120
Atwood says so and your mum smells the

58
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,900
other side says oh yeah well you're just

59
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,360
a back-end developer with no idea how

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,250
the web is meant to work you're so

61
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,380
stupid you don't understand inheritance

62
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,440
and you're scared of the Cascade

63
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,049
hahahaha and your mum's so fat she has

64
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,170
her own namespace

65
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,560
we've all heard these arguments

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,080
regardless of which side you're on

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,680
it doesn't really matter now I love

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,690
component based development I didn't

69
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,170
used to but I do now because it reminds

70
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,410
me of when I was a software engineer

71
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,880
writing Fortran and COBOL and 6502

72
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,540
assembler

73
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,900
in the late eighties yes I know I might

74
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:33,680
look 24 but I'm actually nearly 30 um

75
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,810
I'm talking mostly about react but we

76
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,030
could also talk this could also be

77
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,240
appropriate for web components which is

78
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,170
a spec that Alex Russell from Google has

79
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,040
been heavily promoting Google are really

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,570
behind this

81
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,620
I don't want you to read too much into

82
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,680
the fact that web components is pushed

83
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,490
by Google and it's an anagram of spec

84
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,770
own entomb that's just a coincidence I'm

85
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,930
absolutely certain but I love

86
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,850
component-based architecture because it

87
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,380
reminds me of when I used to write

88
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,290
little modules because the computer I

89
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,080
worked on could only have 8k in memory

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,480
at any one time and we could take

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,070
modules and share them and link them all

92
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,580
together

93
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,910
I like reusability because I don't know

94
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,260
about you you're all terribly

95
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,650
hard-working but I'm really lazy and if

96
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,720
I could write something once and use it

97
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,780
a thousand times in the future while

98
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,540
continuing to build the client I'm a

99
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,450
happy guy and I get to go to the pub I

100
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,110
like composability I like testability if

101
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,090
you have a small component it's easy to

102
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,730
do unit tests on it because a component

103
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,820
is a unit and I like shareability

104
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,919
I like to be able to give these two

105
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,740
people on my team or put them on github

106
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,230
so other people in the world can take

107
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,330
them because that's what we do we share

108
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,760
stuff of course you've all seen this

109
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,090
this gift about out about the

110
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,940
complexities of CSS and maybe this isn't

111
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,280
so true anymore now we have flexbox and

112
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,680
CSS grids

113
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,800
you CSS grids Jing gets $10 every time

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,760
you use them from the w3c but it's true

115
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,870
that CSS for components is a bit of a

116
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,560
pay

117
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,180
in the ass or ass depending upon what

118
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,220
you call your ass we can talk about that

119
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,639
later when we talk about toilet paper

120
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,740
the trouble with CSS four components is

121
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,120
everything's global you can't adequately

122
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,870
scoop your rules to a component easily

123
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,130
so Styles can leak or clash the order

124
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,320
affects the Cascade and when you're

125
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,880
pulling in lots of different components

126
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,880
that can easily become unmanageable and

127
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,970
give you surprises it's really hard to

128
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,889
make an adequate dependency system for

129
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,370
CSS also it relies upon markup structure

130
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,639
yes your HTML doesn't no need to know

131
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,060
about your CSS but often your CSS really

132
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,250
needs to know about your HTML structure

133
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,290
because you're using selectors that

134
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,930
might depend upon it and the problem of

135
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,970
course is if you break something it can

136
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,990
break silently when I used to work as

137
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,330
the front-end developer of a

138
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,570
governmental legal site in the UK before

139
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,180
the days of all the modern cool stuff we

140
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,300
have now it will be midnight on Saturday

141
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,660
when I would copy over CSS changes by

142
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,570
FTP it to the live server and then it

143
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,960
was absolutely terrifying because some

144
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,900
forgotten page in the hundred thousand

145
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,750
page CMS driven system would have

146
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,630
terrible font or the layout would break

147
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,750
and well that's why I look so terrible

148
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,850
that's why I look like this because of

149
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,610
all the stress of CSS breaking silently

150
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,000
and me not being able to test for it so

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,300
we've invented something called Bing CSS

152
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,680
in JavaScript this is probably CSS rules

153
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,500
but in some kind of object notation like

154
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,039
JSON rather than the squiggly brackets

155
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,289
we all love this isn't you

156
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:38,700
Netscape 3 had this thing called j SS

157
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,430
JavaScript style sheets you could only

158
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,820
use this JavaScript way

159
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,530
to style things in Netscape three and

160
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,200
they proposed it for the w3c the w3c

161
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,480
said whatever and like whatever whatever

162
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,150
whatever because it's three w's and so

163
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,130
the Netscape people then wrote a J ssnoa

164
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,750
CSS 2j sss converter which is why a

165
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,290
netscape if you turn javascript off

166
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,960
style was wouldn't apply with CSS but

167
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,390
anyway this thing j sss or as i like to

168
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,680
call it G's didn't really take off

169
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,970
terribly well so I've looked at some of

170
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,100
the the CSS in JavaScript solutions I

171
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,380
counted 59 competing solutions on

172
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,410
Michelle buteau Lee's list on github and

173
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,500
I have an opinion about CSS in j/s I've

174
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,690
looked at them and I can exclusively

175
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,150
reveal without risk of contradiction

176
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,510
that CSS in j/s is a sick perverted

177
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,730
world a sadistic Candyland in the sky

178
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,060
write it down there will be a test later

179
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,770
legal notice other opinions are

180
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,300
available

181
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,640
CSS is great I love it it's great

182
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,730
because you get fantastic ID support

183
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,310
whether you're using visual studio that

184
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,030

validation their CSS generators and

189
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,720
there's a huge community who know and

190
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,100
share tips about CSS it's also designers

191
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,430
anybody here a designer a few of you

192
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,130
well these are designers in the wild

193
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,090
drinking some flat skinny saw white

194
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,150

195
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,030
avocado toast lamenting they can't

196
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,870
afford a house and using Apple machines

197
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,920
and they're designing things and the

198
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,140
thing is of course these guys and girls

199
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,780
are really great at designing stuff and

200
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,150
because we all do responsive design now

201
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,370
we don't design in Photoshop comps we

202
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,780
design in the browser CSS is their tool

203
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,290
and we are making these expensive and

204
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,800
highly creative people abandon their

205
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,940
tool of choice to fit our development

206
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,760
methodology which is naughty of us and

207
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,230
it's discourteous and it's just bad form

208
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,470
if you disagree ask your designer to

209
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,020
open up your computer and choose the

210
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,600
fonts and colors that they want for your

211
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,480
operating system and IDE and then see if

212
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,000
that makes you more or less productive

213
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,490
and happy I'm happy to do this for you

214
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,980
myself you've seen my design skills I'm

215
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,970
pretty good CSS in JavaScript also costs

216
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,310
us you have to load a j/s library to

217
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,620
handle CSS creation at runtime you're

218
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,960
creating and modifying CSS at runtime

219
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,730
and if you're doing server-side

220
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,370
rendering and if you're not why are you

221
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,610
not doing it you're doing the CSS twice

222
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,560
once on the server and then squirting it

223
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,860
down the wire so I

224
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,899
been consulting now for seven or eight

225
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:28,570
months with wicks who are a website

226
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,500
builder and I'm advising them on web

227
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,750
standards because they wanted to solve

228
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,459
the CSS four components problem and I've

229
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,560
been helping them and giving them

230
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,310
fashion advice this is my colleague edo

231
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,790
edo rosen tile and he was asleep in our

232
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,120
smoking room in our tel-aviv office you

233
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,269
can see that the famous CSS blind is

234
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:01,810
above him and he was dreaming about a

235
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,200
solution and in his dream he wanted CSS

236
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,870
that was modular and only scoped to a

237
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,180
component but he wanted it also to be

238
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,660
dynamic he wanted it to be performant so

239
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,779
working at build time rather than run

240
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,600
time he wanted it to have all the

241
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,269
capabilities that CSS also gives us

242
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,760
because many CSS in JS libraries you

243
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,670
can't even do things like hover and he

244
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,310
wanted compatibility with all the

245
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,070
existing tooling and he wanted to be

246
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,980
able to customize components from the

247
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,060
outside too as well as have their

248
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,890
styling wrapped up with the components

249
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,199
well we came up with a single scalable

250
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,060
which is CSS four components

251
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,910
it's a preprocessor like less or sass

252
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,240
for styling components with typed CSS

253
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,579
basically what we're trying to do is do

254
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:57,610
for CSS what typescript does for

255
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,070
JavaScript so the first thing we wanted

256
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,350
to do was abstract stuff so that your

257
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,660
styling doesn't have to know about the

258
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,180
internal architecture of the component

259
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,180
so if you had a component from another

260
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,140
team or another another company and they

261
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,940
change something about the internal

262
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,930
markup structure your CSS won't break so

263
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,550
what we decided to do was have custom

264
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,930
States like like hover or focus we

265
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,880
wanted to be able to say if you are a

266
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,029
nav button in my gallery and it's in the

267
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:36,050
state of loading don't show it

268
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,870
it's a custom state like hover or focus

269
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,269
of course you can use those two but this

270
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:44,810
gives you custom ones and we also use

271
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,550
the pseudo element syntax here to

272
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,800
address things that are inside a

273
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,740
component without having to know the

274
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,620
structure anything that you give a class

275
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,130
name to is exposed as a pseudo element

276
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,829
that you can hang styles from without

277
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:06,680
having to know what the structure is or

278
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,579
if the structure changes your CSS won't

279
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:13,339
with type CSS you beget a superset we've

280
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:15,529
got inner parts of pseudo elements we

281
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:18,529
have custom pseudo classes type aware

282
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:21,940
dependencies IDE and build support and

283
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,519
we can optimize so we can do analysis at

284
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,950
Build time and do what we call rule set

285
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,890
shaking which is like tree shaking but

286
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,380
for rock sets

287
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,110
this gives us all kinds of useful

288
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,890
developer tooling like IDs like code

289
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,070
completion this is us using style in

290
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,000
visual studio with style intelligence

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,459
plugin and you can see that once it's

292
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:52,190
analyzed your structures it's offering

293
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,510
you all of the pseudo classes and the

294
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,640
internal stylings that you might want to

295
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,010
use which makes your life much more

296
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,370
productive this is how it works I don't

297
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,690
want to go to more deeply into the

298
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,130
syntax because I don't want to bore you

299
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,740
or waste your time or fall over that

300
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,980
thing again but I want to show you that

301
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,880
this syntax is entirely compatible with

302
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,100
CSS so we use this st4 styler ball

303
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,610
vendor prefix so that you don't get an

304
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,360
error in your IDE at Build time all of

305
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,910
these vendor prefixes are compiled away

306
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,180
and it compiles down transpires down to

307
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,829
static valid cross browser vanilla CSS

308
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,940
and of course you can mix stainable

309
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,000
compiler directives with absolutely

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,880
normal

311
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,949
CSS because we're importing from a

312
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:55,610
component we're giving it a default name

313
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,500
extending it and we can use all of our

314
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,759
CSS as usual we have a type system you

315
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,709
can define the gallery internals this is

316
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,660
saying this component can have states of

317
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,660
loading or empty to set them you have to

318
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,370
do this in JavaScript depending upon

319
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,100
when you know you're loading or you're

320
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,250
empty and you can do that by default you

321
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,319
do it with a data attribute but you can

322
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,010
customize that some more the status of

323
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,299
it at the moment is we have pseudo

324
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,390
elements and classes imports mix ins

325
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,350
with JavaScript or typescript theming vs

326
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,610
code extension that I showed you for

327
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,990
code completion etc coming up

328
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,210
integrations with more things and just

329
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,270
react and web pack and at the moment

330
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,130
we're working on pseudo classes with

331
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,440
parameters so you can say if this is a

332
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,559
column and its name is email make it

333
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,809
golden rod because golden rod is the

334
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:01,320
best color for matters we know this is

335
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,000
in other languages and we want to be

336
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,630
compatible with those my guys committed

337
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,850
this stuff to get up last week I'm not

338
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,590
actually sure if it's released yet but

339
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,130
it's in the repo declaration interfaces

340
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,010
so you can say for example you can style

341
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,320
any of the colors or the fonts in this

342
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,360
component but you cannot actually change

343
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,210
its layout so you won't break it if

344
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,520
you're laying out with grid or flexbox

345
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,880
for example more integrations and with

346
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,370
dogfooding it and battle testing it the

347
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,220
reason we've written this is because Wix

348
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,850
has had a problem with its websites that

349
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,049
it hosts particularly on mobile because

350
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:48,510
everything is done with CSS that is made

351
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,130
at runtime and sent down the wire to be

352
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,559
parsed in JavaScript it's very slow on

353
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,169
mobile this is much more performant and

354
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:00,450
within the next six months

355
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,240
you will see styler ball powering nearly

356
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,100
all of wix's 110 million websites that

357
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,530
it hosts at the moment another thing

358
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,140
we're doing is getting rid of lots of

359
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,970
JavaScript to layout we've done some

360
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,760
analysis and we've realized that nearly

361
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,460
all of the websites that currently have

362
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,560
some JavaScript to lay them out can be

363
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,830
done with CSS grid so there will be

364
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,230
about a hundred million Wix websites

365
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,720
using styler ball and CSS grid for

366
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,230
layout rather than runtime CSS in j/s

367
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,450
and rather than javascript it's going to

368
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,000
be a lot faster and we're battle testing

369
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,390
it for that this is a robust system and

370
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,730
it's going to be compatible with web

371
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,980
components and we're also keeping a

372
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,500
close eye on the Houdini spec which is

373
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,710
the ability to extend CSS with

374
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,900
JavaScript we've just committed that to

375
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,690
the repo so you can have JavaScript

376
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,590
macros in your CSS that will compile at

377
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,850
Build time into static CSS it's BDSM

378
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,210
license so you can get it right now and

379
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,570
try it out get it while they're hot it's

380
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,090
styler border IO and the repo is github

381
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,800
coms week's styler ball I want to

382
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,160
emphasize that I do not hate JavaScript

383
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,020
this is me having a beer with Brendan

384
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,420
Eich who invented JavaScript and how

385
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,690
come we Emily who invented CSS and you

386
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,060
can see that we're all smiling and none

387
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,780
of us hit each other at any point until

388
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,530
about the fourth or the fifth point and

389
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,320
I'm not a Luddite I used to be anti

390
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,430
frameworks when I was living in an ivory

391
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,030
tower of of web standards and then I

392
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,520
went into industry and saw how real

393
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,590
industry makes websites and it was

394
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,350
eye-opening to me I'm not afraid of

395
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,200
frameworks in Bucharest somebody had

396
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,990
written react wrong but I was not scared

397
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:08,160
I'm not scared of frameworks if you want

398
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,930
to use reactant bengi allure bone

399
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,750
strapped hub patch Jas

400
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,870
use it knock yourself out do whatever

401
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,600
makes your life faster and more

402
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,630
productive but remember that all of

403
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,880
these things are just tools they might

404
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,860
be well known tools but they are just

405
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:36,159
tools and using your tools well is the

406
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,220
definition of an artisan or craftsman or

407
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,950
craftswoman a worker in a skilled trade

408
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,600
especially one that involves making

409
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,010
things by hand

410
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,070
but I prefer this Japanese word any

411
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,820
Japanese people in the house good then

412
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,350
you won't hit me for mispronouncing it

413
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,380
shokunin means not only having technical

414
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,039
skill but implies an attitude and social

415
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,740
consciousness a social obligation to

416
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,720
work is best for the general welfare of

417
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,929
the people an obligation both material

418
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:10,600
and spiritual and I think that's what

419
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,490
we've been in danger of losing sight of

420
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,730
as we fight our holy wars

421
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,720
now I'm an HTML coholic okay this is uh

422
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,030
it's actually a brand of clothing in

423
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,850
Japan so they kind of looked very

424
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,679
weirdly at me at this department store

425
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,090
when I lay down next to it but I first

426
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,580
encountered the web in 1999 so instead

427
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,710
of talking about my employers product

428
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,169
let's talk about me let's talk about me

429
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:45,039
going me this is me a couple of years

430
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,830
ago okay this is me in 96 when I went to

431
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,820
work in Bangkok Thailand setting up a

432
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,549
school a primary school and a

433
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:00,400
kindergarten which I set up and ran for

434
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,909
a few years and when I was there is some

435
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:06,220
of my students it's really nice they

436
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,720
were married now and they invited me to

437
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,630
their weddings blessum when I was in

438
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,020
Thailand I got sick

439
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,760
basically I lost the use of my left eye

440
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,539
and my left leg and my arm and I went to

441
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,030
hospital because I had private medicine

442
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,850
and they diagnosed me with something

443
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,320
called mole

444
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,470
- boss chlorosis which is lots of these

445
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,380
in the brain and that was really really

446
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,809
lucky because in Southeast Asia

447
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,909
multiple sclerosis is a really rare

448
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:39,330
disease it gets more and more prevalent

449
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,820
the further north or south you go from

450
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,730
the equator so it's very big very

451
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,909
popular in Scotland Norway etcetera but

452
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:50,070
I was lucky because the lady who

453
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,440
happened to be the duty neurologist had

454
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,210
just done a year's work in an MS

455
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,190
facility in the US and because it's so

456
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,830
rare in Southeast Asia they couldn't

457
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,019
give me any english-language information

458
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:06,769
the only thing they could find was

459
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:10,049
Xeroxes from a medical textbook full of

460
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,330
encouraging photographs of autopsy

461
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,690
brains which are about you but it didn't

462
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,740
really make me feel better

463
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,259
but when I got out of hospital and

464
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,019
taught myself to walk again I went

465
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,929
downstairs from my apartment in Pratt

466
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:27,179
Nam in Bangkok and there was this thing

467
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,730
called an internet cafe so I went to

468
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,559
this internet cafe and I typed in

469
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,379
multiple sclerosis into Alta Vista which

470
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:36,269
was like Google but powered by steam and

471
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:39,600
black and white and it came back with

472
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,470
this julie's joint which is a global

473
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,289
support network for people with MS it

474
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,690
was founded in 95 by Julie hull up with

475
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,320
Julie Howell

476
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,600
when you're first diagnosed you may not

477
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,580
know anything about MS or anybody who

478
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,799
has it it can be a scary and lonely time

479
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,620
I created Julie's joint so that people

480
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,269
were living with this disease can get to

481
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,549
know others around the world to share

482
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,379
experiences and give each other support

483
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,990
and that was great

484
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,419
instead of autopsy brains I was talking

485
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,460
to people who had the disease had lived

486
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,889
with it for a few years it made me feel

487
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,049
better and taught me that I hadn't been

488
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:18,690
just handed a death sentence there were

489
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,269
people from the UK USA Australia Canada

490
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,509
Germany Sweden Switzerland rest of the

491
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:27,629
world etc but this blew my mind because

492
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:32,580
what I had here was a collective of

493
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,500
different people around the world with

494
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,149
different backgrounds different hopes

495
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:38,200
different experiences different kind

496
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,440
Computers this is 99 all coming together

497
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,350
to work together on something and it

498
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,770
made me realize that the web was where I

499
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,620
wanted to work so I went back to the UK

500
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,750
and set up a publishing company for web

501
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,440
professionals became a web developer

502
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,230
became deputy CTO of opera and now I'm

503
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,740
consulting for weeks because this opened

504
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,030
my eyes about the web

505
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,310
weirdly when I got back to the UK and

506
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,130
set up a book publishing company the

507
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,560
first book we commissioned was about web

508
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,960
accessibility and one of the reviewers

509
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,110
was a woman called Julie who was the

510
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,810
woman who set up that ms support site

511
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,090
that I found in Bangkok and we've become

512
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,950
good friends who we are going to see the

513
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,090
Sex Pistols here we are at a party for

514
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,550
the 10th anniversary of that web site

515
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,880
here's Julie with my daughter going to

516
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,180
an art gallery and I met her and became

517
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,850
friends with her through the web and it

518
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,760
made me think what what is the web it's

519
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,840
not loads of computers it's on loads of

520
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,210
computers but that's not what it is it's

521
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,080
certainly not clowns it's definitely not

522
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,960
a series of tubes this is what the web

523
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,200
is it sees African women it's this blind

524
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,700
guy in Toronto

525
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,640
it's these ladies on a bus that I

526
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,200
photographed when I was visiting

527
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,790
Bangladesh it's this lady in Korea that

528
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,730
I photographed it is these two farmers

529
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,640
in Thailand that I photographed it's

530
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,890
these guys that I found on a stock

531
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,200
images image

532
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,280
it's this man with Down syndrome on the

533
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,330
New York subway

534
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,240
it is these ladies on the beach in South

535
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,940
India that I photographed a year ago the

536
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:37,630
web is people and people are here there

537
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,240
are more people living inside this

538
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,490
circle than the rest of the world

539
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,580
outside this circle and that was fat

540
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,910
checked by The Washington Post Asia is

541
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:56,539
now four billion people I've counted um

542
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:03,309
by 2050 or 20 know by 2050 the

543
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:07,150
population of Asia will be 5 billion the

544
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:11,230
United Nations predicts China 1.3

545
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,500
billion people with a GDP growth of 7.7%

546
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,960
I don't know what the GDP growth of

547
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,500
Singapore is but in the West and in the

548
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,280
u.s. they would kill to have growth at

549
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,390
this level on Black Friday and Cyber

550
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,290
Monday in 2015 the last dates I have

551
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,710
figures for 2.9 billion US dollars

552
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,750
changed hands in the US on double 11 day

553
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,669
the 11th of November 2015 in China nine

554
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:48,549
point two billion dollars changed hands

555
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:51,040
total online retail spending in China

556
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,190
reached 307 billion in 2013 and is

557
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,330
forecast to grow at 20% until 2019 when

558
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,600
XI it should exceed a trillion the

559
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,260
numbers of startups valued at a billion

560
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,560
or over that's China

561
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:15,160
Africa is 1 billion people now by 2050

562
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,150
that will rise to 2 billion by 2100

563
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,179
which may be a little late for me but

564
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:26,260
maybe not for you by 2100 the population

565
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,870
of the world will peak at 11 billion

566
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,650
people five billion of them will live in

567
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,340
after

568
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,000
Africa has relatively good connections

569
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,549
now this is a map of the submarine

570
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:42,309
cables going into Africa you can see it

571
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:44,230
starts pretty small and then it's

572
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,280
getting bigger and they're getting

573
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,830
faster and faster connectivity but of

574
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,250
course submarine cables go under the sea

575
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,929
and they end up at the shore and Africa

576
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:59,620
is really really big so whereas people

577
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,830
on the outside the shorelines of Africa

578
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,070
have good connectivity people inside

579
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,970
don't and maps lie to us or release maps

580
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,679
that are done in the Mercator projection

581
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,070
Africa is really really really big you

582
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,980
can fit China the UK India the US

583
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,730
Eastern Europe in the landmass of Africa

584
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,020
so if you live here away from the coasts

585
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,690
internet access is slow and really

586
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,760
expensive landlocked countries play

587
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,970
higher prices for bandwidth in Africa

588
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,840
for instance being landlocked adds 232

589
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,390
US dollars monthly for fixed broadband

590
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,790
imagine I mean in a rich economy like

591
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:50,400
Singapore or the US or the UK my paying

592
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,530
230 dollars a month more for my

593
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,350
broadband would be a real bummer

594
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,620
imagine how prohibitive that is in

595
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,040
low-income countries like sub-saharan

596
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,590
Africa and as a safer mobile broadband

597
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,400
the difference is a hundredfold for

598
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,799
landlocked countries in Pakistan it's a

599
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,950
dollar 48 for a gigabyte of data a month

600
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,070
in South OMA and Princip it's a hundred

601
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,919
and seventy US dollars but the paradox

602
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,490
is people become richer when their

603
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,400
broadband becomes faster the employment

604
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,260
rate in connected areas relevant to

605
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,320
unconnected areas increased by 4.2 and

606
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,919
between 4.2 and 10% when fast internet

607
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,730
became available in most countries in

608
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,040
our sample the increase of skilled

609
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,570
employment was bigger for workers with

610
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,320
secondary or tertiary education but

611
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,210
who only completed primary school are

612
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,910
also more likely to hold down a job once

613
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,760
fast Internet becomes available but it's

614
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,850
not just about affordability despite the

615
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,500
fact that Africa has the lowest income

616
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,990
per capita of any region affordability

617
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,870
was only identified as the most

618
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,570
important barrier in one of the 13

619
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,170
countries at the GSMA surveyed network

620
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,060
coverage is not perceived as an issue

621
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,000
for most countries however mobile

622
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,090
broadband 3G or 4G still remains low in

623
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,450
Africa the biggest problem was a lack of

624
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,760
awareness or locally relevant content

625
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,740
and its lack of digital skills it's the

626
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,020
same in Asia a lack of awareness and

627
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,730
locally relevant content was the most

628
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,680
commonly cited barrier to Internet

629
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,090
adoption 50% of websites in the world

630
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,070
are in English but that's only spoken by

631
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,140
10% of the speakers in those countries

632
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,140
only 2% of the websites worldwide are in

633
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,060
Mandarin and 0.1% are in Hindi in Africa

634
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,280
7 of 10 people who do not use the web

635
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,440
say they don't know how to use it and 4

636
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,810
in 10 do not know what the internet is

637
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,930
and that's not just in emerging

638
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,790
economies in high-income Poland and

639
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,370
Slovakia one-fifth of adults cannot use

640
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:09,570
a computer in the States 41% of seniors

641
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,830
do not use the Internet

642
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,710
53% don't have broadband natural access

643
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,850
and 23% don't have cell phones this is

644
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,580
my friend Paul Arnett and he tweeted

645
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,400
this on Christmas Day he's doing tech

646
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,360
support we heard about that earlier me

647
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,790
on tech support what buttons are on your

648
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,000
screen my mom a hot water bottle and a

649
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,990
dentist's chair it's funny right but you

650
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,550
can see her thinking here the things

651
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:45,330
that we take for granted as obvious are

652
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,660
not a friend of mine called Sophia

653
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,170
Parvez does route just usability testing

654
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:57,660
in rural areas in Pakistan and she's

655
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,070
given me permission to show you this

656
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,879
video

657
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:02,389
I've edited it down but it's still

658
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:07,619
bloody painful this is a guy in his 20s

659
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:08,909
in Pakistan

660
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:12,059
he's a feature phone user he's been

661
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:14,940
given a smartphone and he's been asked

662
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,109
to google the name of his favorite

663
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:32,659
actress

664
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:48,770
two minutes 53 seconds

665
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,030
and he gives up at 3 minutes and 15

666
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,200
seconds of course the problem he had was

667
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,600
that his feature phone and Nokia have

668
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,420
physical keys he simply doesn't know how

669
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,080
to call up the virtual keyboard I show

670
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,820
you that because the next time you make

671
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,070
something that you think is incredibly

672
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,880
intuitive think of this guy he's not

673
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,490
maybe yet he just doesn't know how to do

674
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,320
it and of course not everybody has

675
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,720
trouble with smart phones this this

676
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,540
Cambodian boy whom I met on a beach when

677
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,610
I was on vacation in Cambodia

678
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,400
I don't speak any climber but he was

679
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,750
very interested in my Google Nexus 5x

680
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,550
within one minute of me miming

681
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,680
instructions he'd managed to take this

682
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,260
selfie of himself a photograph which

683
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,210
never fails to cheer me up when I'm

684
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,820
feeling a bit melancholy there's a

685
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,860
digital divide not just between the

686
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,580
wealthy nations and emerging economies

687
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,870
there's a digital divide in Africa

688
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,350
between poor and rich old or young ruler

689
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,820
urban and men and women and as a digital

690
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,250
divide in India when I landed in India

691
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,750
last year to do some press and TV work

692
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,100
the in The Times of India they announced

693
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,490
that rural mobile Internet users grew by

694
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:13,110
93 percent year on year but that 93

695
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,470
percent growth means that a staggering

696
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,310
nine percent of people in rural India

697
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,000
have any internet access at all that is

698
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,060
compared with 53 percent in urban areas

699
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,610
the World Bank in a report they

700
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,820
published early last year called Digital

701
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,890
dividends it's actually really

702
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,400
interesting and it's 370 pages I know

703
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,370
what has happened to my life the World

704
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,830
Bank have said making the internet

705
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,200
universally accessible and affordable

706
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,470
should be a global priority the web

707
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,670
foundation which was founded by Timbo or

708
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,100
certain berners-lee to you the web

709
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,770
foundation said in a

710
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,250
shocking blog post in Nigeria the data

711
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,110
needed to watch a two minutes of online

712
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,990
video a day can cost more than sending

713
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,800
your child to school for a month in the

714
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,610
words of the car parking machine in

715
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,710
Chinatown in my home city of Birmingham

716
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:23,480
change is possible and change is coming

717
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,370
there is a grassroot initiative called

718
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,120
fast Africa and they had lots of

719
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,110
activities across lots of African cities

720
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:37,500
in 2016 fast Africa they are agitating

721
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,620
for fair and transparent ICT taxes they

722
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,540
want governments and donors to step up

723
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,510
efforts agree on affordability and

724
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,760
affordability is defined as one gigabyte

725
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,200
of mobile data for two percent of

726
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,440
average income and I was actually very

727
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,230
pleased that yesterday the broadband

728
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,720
Commission of the UN has actually

729
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,450
adopted this as their target for

730
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,090
affordability fast Africa also wants in

731
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,730
public access solutions things like

732
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,700
computers in schools or community

733
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,260
colleges which are open to the public

734
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,110
after hours and making getting women

735
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,930
online a top priority the World Bank

736
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,090
online work can prove particularly

737
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,940
beneficial for women youth older workers

738
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,290
and the disabled who prefer the

739
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,120
flexibility of working from home or

740
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,060
working flexible hours in India women

741
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,670
are 62 percent less likely to use the

742
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,000
internet in the men in rural India two

743
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,010
percent of women use the internet or

744
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,950
actually no two percent of the nine

745
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,840
percent of people are internet access

746
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,990
are female the other 98 percent are male

747
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,530
but the paradox of this is we know that

748
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:53,040
the web empowers women globally in

749
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,500
non-agricultural employment women are

750
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,810
twenty five percent of the workforce but

751
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,770
in online working portals 44 percent of

752
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,210
the workforce are women when asked why

753
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,570
women said the ability to earn extra

754
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,920
money was not as important

755
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,750
the ability to work from home and work

756
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,180
flexible hours because worldwide of

757
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,450
course women bear the brunt of the

758
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,510
requirement to do child-rearing looking

759
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,230
after sick or elderly relatives

760
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,620
interestingly and sadly the biggest

761
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,500
disadvantage for women was payment is

762
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,870
not good enough which was much less of a

763
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,120
disadvantage for men suggesting that

764
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,770
just like everywhere else in the world

765
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,940
there is a disastrously unfair pay gap

766
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,870
between what women and men earn it's not

767
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,470
all bad news

768
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:52,050
I was recently in Kerala in South India

769
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,700
they speak a language called Malayalam

770
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,250
there it's the only language name in the

771
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,110
world which is a palindrome and spelt

772
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,480
the same backwards interestingly and in

773
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,030
Malayalam this says khuddam battery and

774
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,390
khuddam Bashi translates as prosperity

775
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,880
for the family it's an initiative by the

776
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,900
caralyn government interestingly Kerala

777
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,480
has the highest female literacy the

778
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,790
highest literacy the highest life

779
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,880
expectancy the lowest infant mortality

780
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,790
in India and it's consistently run by a

781
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,870
democratically elected marxist

782
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:32,080
government which is interesting but they

783
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,540
set up the could and battery project to

784
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,120
outsource IT services to cooperatives of

785
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,670
women from poor backgrounds 90% of those

786
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,620
women had not worked outside the home

787
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,290
before okay so I've given you all these

788
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,930
facts and figures which are pretty

789
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,840
pretty demoralizing I didn't swear do

790
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,280
not get me for the code of conduct I

791
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,070
said oath feet I just tripped over what

792
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,070
can you do you can make a progressive

793
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,620
web app I'm not going to go into what

794
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,810
they are particularly now because I'm

795
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:08,800
running over time doubtless you know it

796
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,140
is no coincidence that the best and

797
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,600
earliest progressive web apps have come

798
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,250
out of Asia and Africa Indonesia

799
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:23,500
Indonesia Kenya Nigeria India because

800
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,519
downloading a typical app on

801
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,579
an Indian network of 20 megabytes will

802
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:30,919
take more than 30 minutes and more often

803
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:34,309
than not just craps out and cheaper

804
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:36,679
Android devices are pretty low in

805
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:39,890
storage at Google i/o last year it was

806
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,380
announced that 25% of new Android

807
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,880
shipments only have 512 Meg of RAM and

808
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,390
very low storage space so if you have a

809
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,390
massive downloadable app even if the

810
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,029
user can actually download it it is

811
00:41:56,029 --> 00:41:57,890
taking up space on their phone with

812
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,479
space that's limited the user is

813
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:01,159
comparing their personal photo

814
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:05,239
collection with getting your app we

815
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:07,249
didn't stand a chance said birdly in

816
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:08,989
there below with their blog post why you

817
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:10,849
shouldn't bother creating a mobile app

818
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:12,919
we didn't send a chance we're fighting

819
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:15,199
with both our competitors and other apps

820
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,689
for a few more megabytes of room inside

821
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:20,689
people's phones and our Geryon developer

822
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:22,549
that I interviewed a year ago said

823
00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:24,649
Nigerians are extremely data sensitive

824
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:27,140
they sideload apps and other content

825
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,809
from third parties and they never update

826
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:33,409
them with PWS without the download

827
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:35,689
overhead of native apps developers in

828
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:37,459
Nigeria can now give a great and

829
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:41,679
up-to-date experience for their users

830
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,479
what else can you do you can simply

831
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,899
optimize your images in 2011 I had a

832
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,149
slight hangover it's a very unusual

833
00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:51,769
thing for me but it was one of those

834
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:55,429
times and I'd read a blog post by Jake

835
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:58,399
and lots of developers had said it's

836
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:01,729
really difficult doing images because if

837
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:04,519
you send a really nice shiny image to

838
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:08,269
these new Retina devices on a three inch

839
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:11,749
square black and white Nokia screen it

840
00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:13,789
has to be compressed down which takes

841
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:16,459
CPU cycles and uses the battery and

842
00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:18,469
people are downloading far more data

843
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:20,659
than they actually need whereas if you

844
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:25,459
give a low resolution images otar if you

845
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:28,249
give a low resolution image it doesn't

846
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:32,899
show very well on the retina things now

847
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:34,369
you told me I can go on for as long as I

848
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:38,690
want there's only another 40 minutes

849
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:47,380
and you're fueling me now the average

850
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,670
webpage not websites not web app is for

851
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:55,450
Meg of which 1.8 Meg is images if you

852
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,880
can make your image is smaller with

853
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,760
responsive images you are using less

854
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,980
bandwidth I did a talk on responsive

855
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,720
images because I was one of the team of

856
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,240
handsome men who made the picture

857
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,550
element etc that's in all the browsers

858
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,940
now and a developer saw my talk and he

859
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,920
put into practice of things I've talked

860
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,110
about and then told in the next day his

861
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,830
website his web page had gone down in

862
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,790
size by 70% because that matters in

863
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,910
Germany in Germany to afford entry-level

864
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:32,380
mobile broadband for a month you need to

865
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,320
work one hour at average wage in the

866
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,240
States you need to work six hours at

867
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,880
average wage in Brazil you need to work

868
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,670
34 hours at average wage and if you are

869
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,610
sending down vast bloated images you are

870
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,070
making Brazilian people work harder and

871
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:52,440
that's rude liberal hand-wringing ahead

872
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,000
please guard the web as you work on it

873
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,480
it's a medium that has given you a great

874
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,220
sound of a living it allows you to come

875
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,170
to a nice aircon room and listen to

876
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,240
interesting people and listen to me as

877
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,260
well and it gives you a nice

878
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,800
middle-class life it's been good to you

879
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,420
make it good for other people preserve

880
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,660
it for example someone or something or

881
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,130
combination of people of things are

882
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,290
using YouTube to frighten traumatized

883
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,090
and abused children automatically and

884
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,400
scale and it forces me to question my

885
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,350
own beliefs about the Internet at every

886
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:31,900
level this is available on Amazon this

887
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,060
is an iPhone cover of a woman having a

888
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,270
armpits waxed of course this doesn't

889
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,660
actually exist a bot has posted this and

890
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,910
if you were foolish enough to buy it

891
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,040
then they would make it on demand and

892
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,650
send it to you you can also get this

893
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,550
rather nice iPhone case

894
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:55,370
of toenail fungus if you want to or more

895
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:58,820
regrettably and much less funnily you

896
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:05,660
can get this t-shirt made by a bot even

897
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,240
worse I was reading a really really

898
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,650
in-depth report about how fake news in

899
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:18,620
Myanmar has contributed to the ethnic

900
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,710
cleansing / genocide of the reinjure

901
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:25,610
Muslims access to the web is critical

902
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,250
but not sufficient so the World Bank the

903
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,840
full benefits of the information and

904
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,640
communication transformation will not be

905
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,680
realized until countries continue to

906
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,840
improve their business climate investing

907
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,880
people's education health and good

908
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,730
governance but we need to do this the

909
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,070
developing countries are home to ninety

910
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,520
four percent of the global offline

911
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,040
population and those people deserve the

912
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,250
