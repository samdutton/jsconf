[Music]

2
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,080
thank you that the intro was awesome

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,720
like I can't see up here with all these

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,330
things fired up I'm just mind blown so

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,240
hi I'm here to talk to you about CSS

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,439
what a great way to kick off a

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,420
JavaScript conference right thank you

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,149
so what a beautiful place

9
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,600
we are in right I was so excited to come

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,629
here and if you google Singapore you get

11
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,210
beautiful rainbow skies and images like

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,090
this so here's my expectation of

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,930
Singapore and then here's a video from

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,350
my room at the hotel that's ok this is

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,239
life it happens I'm so happy to be here

16
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,609
still as you heard my name is Yuna you

17
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,379
can find me at you know on Twitter

18
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,799
github code pen all the things so if

19
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,210
you're interested in this topic if you

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,549
interested in filters blend modes a web

21
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,680
image performance I write about those

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,380
things online at you know I am that's my

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,869
blog I also co-host a podcast called

24
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,270
tools day so you can check out tools day

25
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,400
it's bi-weekly this year where we talk

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,549
more about JavaScript things as well

27
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:31,439
so as you heard I have a brand new job I

28
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,150
started with like three weeks ago and

29
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,350
they let me come here so I was like

30
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,450
thank you bustle but basically I'm doing

31
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,790
a lot of creative product development

32
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,579
and I'm super stoked to be there so

33
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,939
blend modes because I really wanted to

34
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,280
give this talk because I feel like there

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,200
is an elephant in the room when I talk

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
about blend modes so really this talk is

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,869
like a love letter to a specific company

38
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,340
that is actually sponsoring the next

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,649
break this talk is called blend modes

40
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,219
because but really it's called edge

41
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,970
should implement blend modes because

42
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,869
so blend modes are something that people

43
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,580
have been talking about for a long time

44
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,200
now they're not even new they're not

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,000
even like the hot new thing like CSS

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,020
critter variables

47
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,240
they've existed for years and this has

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,630
been a ticket open on the edge user

49
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,550
voice website since August 2014 and it's

50
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,970
still on the backlog meanwhile every

51
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,340
other browser every single browser has

52
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,990
been planted blend modes three years ago

53
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,300
like this isn't new it's just something

54
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,190
that's kind of waiting to happen

55
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,500
I don't know why this is this is how I

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:51,310
feel anyway so here I'm going to talk to

57
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,320
you about blend modes how to use them

58
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,180
and we're gonna start with some notes

59
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,310
and caveats about blend modes then I'm

60
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,020
gonna get into how blend modes work I'm

61
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,280
going to rush through this because

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,050
there's a lot of content that I want to

63
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,760
share with you and then we're gonna talk

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,220
about the utility of blend modes so how

65
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,560
you can really get the most out of them

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,940
and here is where I'm going to talk

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,770
about simplicity how they can help with

68
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,209
simplicity how they can help with

69
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,380
uniformity consistency and performance

70
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,880
so we're gonna talk about all these

71
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,230
things throughout this talk and then

72
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,910
also touch on creativity we're all

73
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,800
showcase some cool things created with

74
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,890
blend modes so first some caveats and

75
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,959
things to note this is the current

76
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,900
browser support matrix full support on

77
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,880
most browsers Safari has partial support

78
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,950
so they don't support some of the blend

79
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,510
modes it's really important that you do

80
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,980
browser tests if you're implementing

81
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,720
these and also to implement them in a

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,180
progressively enhanced way and as you

83
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,430
can see ie an edge don't really house

84
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,800
the barn just sayin so there's two

85
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,060
different types of black nodes there's

86
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,500
mixed blend mode where you can mix

87
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,510
different elements together on the page

88
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,550
and there's also background blend mode

89
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,350
so background blend mode allows you to

90
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,880
mix elements that have multiple

91
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,070
backgrounds into the other backgrounds

92
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,380
so there are polyfills for background

93
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,600
blend mode that use canvas to do this

94
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,130
kind of mixing but I feel pretty

95
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,959
strongly that you shouldn't really need

96
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,090
to use polyfills when using blend modes

97
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,590
they should just be something that you

98
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,810
use for progressive enhancement so two

99
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,030
different ways to use them also I want

100
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,810
to say that there's

101
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,180
interpolation when you use variables so

102
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,980
if I hover over this image I'm applying

103
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,010
this multiply blend mode on top of this

104
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,020
image of Singapore but you don't see any

105
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,030
change you can't interpolate because

106
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,070
there are no keyframe values that the

107
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,230
CSS can apply to make those changes it's

108
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,480
just a switch it's binary on or off but

109
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,210
you can combine blend modes with any

110
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,430
other CSS properties including filters

111
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,190
and filters do interpolate so you can

112
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,350
sort of get this sort of blurring in

113
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,169
effect if you apply with filters so it's

114
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,169
still kind of a little bit of a hack but

115
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,220
this is something to note it's a little

116
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,490
caveat so okay let's talk about blend

117
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:54,820
modes

118
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,120
what are they blend modes are any way to

119
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,760
combine or mix pixels with each other

120
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,090
through a series of algorithms and those

121
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,520
also vary based on the blend mode there

122
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,900
are a lot of different blend modes out

123
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,750
there specifically in CSS we have a few

124
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,490
different blend mode groups you have the

125
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,130
darken group these all darken based on

126
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,780
the active layer on top the background

127
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,139
layer

128
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,810
there's the Lightning group there is the

129
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,300
contrast group there's an inversion

130
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,030
group and finally a component group of

131
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,100
blend modes we're going to talk about

132
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,840
some of these with our beautiful model

133
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,479
here I'm sorry I didn't ask Thomas I

134
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:34,870
just threw this in there forgive me the

135
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,610
most popular blend mode that you'll see

136
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,400
is multiply what multiply does is it

137
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,740
acts as a projector if you're looking at

138
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,030
a projector and you have these two

139
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,530
layers on top of each other you're

140
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,419
taking the luminosity so the dark and

141
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,000
light values of the active layer and

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,990
multiplying them with the layer behind

143
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,030
it so here we just have a hot pink layer

144
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,419
on top of the images so we also have

145
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,520
something called screen and 3m is the

146
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,220
exact opposite of multiply so with

147
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,870
screen you're taking an inverse and the

148
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,610
way to take inversion when you're

149
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,310
looking at these pixel level component

150
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,590
changes we are going to subtract that

151
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,810
value from one so you take the inverse

152
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,789
of the active layer times the inverse of

153
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,960
the background layer and then you invert

154
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,039
all of that so you're kind of

155
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,950
multiplying the light values have you

156
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,479
all ever seen these amazing creatures

157
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,690
octopus and cuttlefish are so cool I saw

158
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,620
this video on Twitter the other day and

159
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,600
like blew my mind they have

160
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,850
photoreceptive cells in there like

161
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,530
bodies in their skin that they can

162
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,220
expand or contract to camouflage with

163
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,590
the environment around them the seafloor

164
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,660
around them it's just mind-blowing to

165
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,889
watch this so I was really inspired by

166
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,750
this this little guy right here

167
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,870
it's so cute so I wanted to kind of

168
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,699
inject it into our talk as well we have

169
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,310
our little octopus and so what do we

170
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,680
want to use here if we want to blend

171
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,199
this octopus into the background behind

172
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,910
it then we probably want to use

173
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,030
something like multiply right because

174
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,550
that way it just completely blends also

175
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,169
one thing I want to note is you can open

176
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,150
dev tools and just get a list of blend

177
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,190
modes and start playing that way so if

178
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,690
we want to see like screen this would be

179
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,010
the exact opposite of what we want

180
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,720
because we want to make sure that light

181
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,580
fades behind it whenever you have white

182
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,590
and you multiply it it disappears but

183
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,630
when you have black and you screen that

184
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,530
that will disappear so next I want to

185
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,120
talk about to bun modes called darken

186
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,070
and lighten these are similar to

187
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,660
multiply and screen but they work a

188
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,310
little bit differently because they work

189
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,370
on the RGB values so in this case we

190
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,440
have RGB 10 250 darkened by RGB 150 100

191
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,690
150 now when you darken these values

192
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,220
what you're looking for is the darker

193
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,740
value between any of those channels any

194
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,630
of those color channels so if you

195
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,240
compare 10 and 150 which one's darker

196
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,789
like you think about it RGB 0 0 0 is

197
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,270
black so 10 is darker than 150 it's a

198
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,760
lower value on that spectrum and then if

199
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,070
we compare 200 and 100 you get 100 if

200
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,680
you compare 15 150 you get 50 so you

201
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,020
create these new tones these new values

202
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,530
out of these colors that you're blending

203
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,400
same thing with lighting we're looking

204
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,860
for the higher value to get the lighter

205
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,680
color and this also works slightly

206
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,750
differently than the blend modes of

207
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,060
screen and multiply so if I want to do a

208
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,180
mix blend mode of screen here and then I

209
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,020
want to apply a mix blend mode of

210
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,349
lighten you can see here that you see

211
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:34,800
more of the gray shades with

212
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,749
and you see some of that color value

213
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,459
fading out with the screen because of

214
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,169
how differently those colors are being

215
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,979
generated when you mix them together so

216
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,829
the next two are difference and

217
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,209
exclusion so with difference in

218
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,709
exclusion they're looking for similar

219
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,230
pixel values and with difference if

220
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,269
those values are the exact same shade

221
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:56,220
the exact same color then they will turn

222
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,679
black so we've got some like orange on

223
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,420
this shirt so that turns completely

224
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,569
black if I remove this then you can see

225
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,069
that it's a shirt with black on orange

226
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:07,860
on it and then with inversion what your

227
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,079
with exclusion sorry you're gonna have

228
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,720
those similar values turn to 50% great

229
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,079
so it's much more muted now you can also

230
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,119
do this with our octopus but you'll see

231
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:20,519
that every single pixel value will be

232
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,649
completely the opposite color of what we

233
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,749
want it to be if we want it to blend he

234
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:27,089
is now like bright red stands out not a

235
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:29,429
good look for our friend here not what

236
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:30,410
he's going for

237
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,699
but you can use these in really

238
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,379
interesting ways a little while ago I

239
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,989
created a site called Diffie defeat me

240
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:38,790
where you can just take two different

241
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,279
websites and get visual regression

242
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,980
instant and diffic so you can see visual

243
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,329
regressions on two different pages you

244
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,610
can look locally versus your production

245
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,069
site your staging we can compare like

246
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:55,230
the what was 2018 Jas comp Asia com

247
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,019
that's the seer site so we can compare

248
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,009
that to maybe like 2016 site if I have

249
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,259
internet and it's kind of like see

250
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:06,990
visual disk because this works on video

251
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,629
it works on iframes it works on anything

252
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:11,610
it doesn't just work on images so you

253
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,439
could visually see the diffs between the

254
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:16,350
two years and it's just with a single

255
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,749
line of code with your difference blend

256
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:21,689
mode so the last section that I want to

257
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:25,139
highlight is the component blend modes

258
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:26,970
and these are interesting because you

259
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,259
can really understand like how this

260
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,059
color system works when you look at

261
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:31,649
these blend modes so you have hue

262
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:34,470
saturation luminosity the luminosity is

263
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,600
the light and dark value that it kind of

264
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,009
looks like a cone the lightest on top

265
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,899
the darkest of the bottom the saturation

266
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,809
is what you get when you're coming from

267
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,720
a 50% gray and mixing that with a fully

268
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,100
saturated value of that hue component

269
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,620
and the hue is what the value is around

270
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,529
the color spectrum in this diagram so

271
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,990
here again we have the hot pink what

272
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,550
happens when you mix the hue value is

273
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,350
you get sort of like a faded pink

274
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,290
overlay on Thomas over here if we're

275
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,779
using saturation because that pink is a

276
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,430
lot more vibrant you're keeping all

277
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,589
those values from the shirt from the

278
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:10,329
skin from the books behind him and

279
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:12,310
you're just increasing the saturation if

280
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,569
I wanted to make this even more

281
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,550
saturated I can make this like yellow or

282
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,259
something and then you really get the

283
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,370
saturation but you're just getting that

284
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,949
that value from it luminosity is just

285
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:22,870
the light and dark value because yellow

286
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,899
is so light we're seeing this look

287
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,300
really faded and muted out and then

288
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,040
color is interesting because it actually

289
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,199
combines multiple blend modes it

290
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:35,949
combines the hue and the saturation and

291
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:38,230
just mixes the luminosity behind it so

292
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,790
this image can be black and white it can

293
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,410
be color and you would never know it

294
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,300
doesn't really matter what it is because

295
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,889
you're mixing it there so I really enjoy

296
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:49,209
using blend modes what makes me enjoy

297
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,529
them and even more is when you can

298
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,300
combine them with multiple colors on a

299
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,980
single plane and you can do that with

300
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,139
CSS gradients so here's just an example

301
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:57,970
of a linear gradient with an overlay

302
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,980
applied to it you can really start to

303
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,660
get creative here and start playing like

304
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,370
if you use exclusion it starts to start

305
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,079
looking really interesting we can use

306
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,560
color and then I do want to note that

307
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,939
when I say progressive enhancement there

308
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:11,680
are ways to do this with blend modes

309
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,600
right now if your browser doesn't

310
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,220
support blend modes it's going to look

311
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,630
like this and that's not a great user

312
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,250
experience you want to make sure that

313
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,839
your user is still seeing something

314
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,269
still seeing the image so instead of

315
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:24,699
applying blend modes on top you can then

316
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,620
apply the blend mode behind the image

317
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,300
and use what we just learned about how

318
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,189
these blend modes work to get the same

319
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:32,680
effect here I'm blending the luminosity

320
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,779
so just the dark and light values of

321
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,649
Thomas to the blend mode behind it so

322
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,329
users will still see the image they just

323
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:43,180
won't see it with this effect on top so

324
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,310
that brings me to uniformity when you

325
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,779
kind of get this all down we start

326
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,730
playing with it you can recreate any

327
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,759
type of effect just by using CSS this is

328
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,230
a project that I made a little while ago

329
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,449
called CSS Graham where we created a lot

330
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:57,160
of the Instagram filters by just using

331
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,610
CSS filters and blend modes so you can

332
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,310
get anywhere

333
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,290
from point A to point B by using this in

334
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,940
a really creative way and then applying

335
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,529
that throughout your entire product

336
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,560
because CSS Cascades there are a few

337
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,330
other ones out there there's CSS Co

338
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,220
which is the vsco cam filters and

339
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,050
there's also color filter which was

340
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,380
inspired by the Spotify effects from

341
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,510
2015 these duotone effects which we will

342
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,900
talk about a little bit later so

343
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,830
simplicity is another thing that blend

344
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,720
modes really give you and something that

345
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,150
blend modes really shine at doing I was

346
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,339
browsing the web recently and I saw this

347
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:33,890
being shared around this reverse knock

348
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,080
out text effect it was being shared on

349
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,120
Twitter so what you need to do for this

350
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,820
is you need to use an extra-wide SVG you

351
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,490
need to hide extra parts overflow:hidden

352
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,550
and you need to use an SVG mask this

353
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,440
feels like a little bit of overkill for

354
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,300
me you have to have JavaScript in here

355
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,550
you have to have your CSS you it's it's

356
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,920
pretty heavy-handed when all you really

357
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,089
need is a single blend mode in CSS so

358
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,770
here you get the same effect you have

359
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,900
your black background with white text

360
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,640
and you plot your multiply blend mode

361
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,010
and you get knockout text and if you

362
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,330
want to get that little arrow thing

363
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,880
that's just a little CSS triangle which

364
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,589
you create with borders they can apply

365
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:14,360
on the end so you don't need these

366
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,040
additional dependencies you can just do

367
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,900
it in CSS with a couple of lines of code

368
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,339
and that's why I think it's so magical

369
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,600
so here's a little pro tip about filters

370
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,210
because this also came up recently if

371
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,240
you have a SVG that you're applying as a

372
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,370
background so I have this image of an

373
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,230
octopus apply its background you can't

374
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,980
edit the color of this SVG by using fill

375
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,720
you can't really edit it if you want to

376
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,400
have multiple colors either if you want

377
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,890
to have this dynamic range so what you

378
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,230
do is you can use filters for this so

379
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,910
filters are pretty well supported

380
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,470
actually what you can do isn't it just

381
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,300
like the brightness I can make this like

382
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,810
darker if I wanted to I could adjust the

383
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,240
contrast I could increase that to two

384
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,120
and then the next thing that people will

385
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,380
mention is well what about the color if

386
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,790
you can't change it from black and white

387
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,390
to a color if you wanted to but you can

388
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,990
because we have the sepia filter so we

389
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,640
can apply the sepia filter and then on

390
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,650
top of that we can apply a hue rotation

391
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,670
so I can apply a hero tation to like six

392
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,470
degrees and now I have a green octopus

393
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,300
and from here I can use saturate and

394
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,370
saturate it too so I have like a bright

395
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,290
green octopus so there's a lot of things

396
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,850
that you can do by just getting created

397
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,860
with filters that you don't need to go

398
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,360
into code change the way that you're

399
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,660
creating these UIs and just use these to

400
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,280
apply different effects and because it

401
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,350
is a CSS filter they are animatable

402
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,780
they're interactive you can do anything

403
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,910
you want with hover States etc for a

404
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,950
user so it's just like a good thing to

405
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,840
know

406
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,400
so speaking of filters I want to quickly

407
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,560
talk about SVG filter effects because

408
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,330
this is really where you have a lot of

409
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,610
control when you're editing your images

410
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,530
and it's because with SVG filter effects

411
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,000
it's really the only place that you can

412
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,160
control the individual channels the red

413
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,810
channel blue tail green channel alpha

414
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,540
channel by applying a single filter onto

415
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,310
an image with CSS blend modes and

416
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,080
filters they're sort of shortcuts that

417
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,810
have derived from SVG filter effect so

418
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,660
you don't get all this control but this

419
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,940
is also among the main of simplicity so

420
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,220
when I'm creating SVG filter effects I

421
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,800
like to use the FE color matrix because

422
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,780
it really lets you individually select

423
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,270
your channel transformations and if you

424
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,350
kind of understand what's going on here

425
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,880
you can see the differences that you're

426
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,610
making so it looks like this basically

427
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,500
you have your red green blue alpha

428
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,510
channels and then multiplier Channel and

429
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,870
it defaults starts as you have one red

430
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,400
value on the red Channel you have one

431
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,900
green value on the green Channel one

432
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,160
blue value on blue Channel and your

433
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,500
alpha channel is one if you want to

434
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,440
create a transformation you can apply

435
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,720
different values on these an important

436
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,000
thing to note is that the scale is 255

437
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,630
in RGB land is 1 in this color matrix

438
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,460
transform land so that's kind of how it

439
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,290
equates if I wanted to do something like

440
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,820
remove all the red and blue and just

441
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,010
have a green colorized image it looks

442
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,570
like this bottom image here where you

443
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,850
just keep the green channels value and

444
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,730
you set a 0 on red and blue so it looks

445
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,200
like this is sort of the effect that we

446
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,050
get if we wanted to do that by applying

447
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,720
these color matrix changes we can do

448
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,370
that we just have to have an SVG on the

449
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,840
page and then we have to apply the

450
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,270
filter you can do that in CSS but you

451
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,800
don't need to have all of this

452
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,960
complexity applying additional SVG is

453
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,449
when we could do a similar thing in

454
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,010
CSS with blend modes without having to

455
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,200
create a filter transformation and

456
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,000
include that in the page so here we're

457
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,590
colorizing we're using the mixed blend

458
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,779
mode of color and we're just picking our

459
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:39,070
color RGB 0 255 0 so I want to note one

460
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,049
thing that consistency browsers are

461
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,789
still not consistent about how they're

462
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:44,289
applying their color transformations

463
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:47,350
so here's Chrome you can see that these

464
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,840
two look as they do when we compare that

465
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,610
to Safari I don't know if you can see it

466
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,049
up here but the chrome one you don't

467
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:54,730
like to get this very well I'm Chrome a

468
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,039
little bit darker Safari is more muted

469
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,380
than these two values but the blend mode

470
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,120
stays pretty much identical it stays the

471
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,240
same when we look at Firefox it doesn't

472
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,710
even support these sort of filter

473
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,110
transformations but it supports blend

474
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,149
modes it's a little bit more faded out

475
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:12,460
there's a little more bright on that

476
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,200
blend mode and then when we can go to

477
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,510
edge it doesn't really support any of it

478
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,539
but this is a reminder about why you

479
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,190
need to progressively enhance your blend

480
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,260
modes and we can change this around to

481
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,120
again apply that layer on top of the

482
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,950
color so the other way around so with

483
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,289
edge either way you're going to get some

484
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:30,730
image if you do it this way

485
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,100
so blend modes are a tiny tiny bit more

486
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,140
consistent when you're applying those as

487
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,460
your color transformations on your

488
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,799
images so if you want to play with

489
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,450
filter effects there's a really great

490
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,039
resource that I want to share with you

491
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,899
where you can actually just change the

492
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:46,059
values and see what that does to your

493
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,610
image this is the URL for it cast kicked

494
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,309
out cannabidiol SVG color - filter just

495
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:52,659
maybe take a picture really quick it's a

496
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:54,940
really cool resource that you can use to

497
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,610
really understand how those were working

498
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,020
so from here I want to talk about the

499
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,539
duotone effect that has become massively

500
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:04,000
popular I've seen this increasingly on

501
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,919
the web and it's a way to really unify

502
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,470
your images on your application on your

503
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,500
website so we wanted to do this with SVG

504
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,169
filters what we need to do is apply a

505
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:16,149
positive value and a negative value for

506
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:18,220
your highlight in your shadow so if you

507
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,360
wanted to have a red highlight and a

508
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,010
blue shadow those are absolute values of

509
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,020
one a negative one we can do that you

510
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,760
can do it on any individual channel so

511
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,140
you can do on the red channel green

512
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,169
Channel or blue channel so with blend

513
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,299
modes you can kind of get a similar sort

514
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:34,030
of effect with some colors but it's a

515
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,919
lot less complex you don't have to make

516
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,900
all the math

517
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,880
you can just set the colors it looks

518
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,830
like this what we're doing is we're

519
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,810
applying a darkened blend mode on the

520
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,850
highlight and are applying a lightened

521
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,920
blend mode on the shadow and we're just

522
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,990
layering those on top of each other so

523
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,270
in the middle here you see this sort of

524
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,510
boxed color duotone effect layer now

525
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,130
with the shadow whatever color you pick

526
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,510
if it's a lighter shadow you're gonna

527
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,430
get rid of more of the details because

528
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,500
your lightening the shadow with that

529
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,070
value so you can take a few disparate

530
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,230
images these I just found the web and

531
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,510
apply a blend mode and really unifies

532
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,880
them so it really increases the quality

533
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,830
of photography and it makes your site

534
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,930
your page or application feel more

535
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,970
uniform you can use this with a single

536
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,720
line of code

537
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,930
so with CSS variables

538
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,060
I love variables who hears you CSS

539
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,120
variables not enough of you they're

540
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,860
they're great they're true variables

541
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,720
that live in your route and they just

542
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,820
they just work so like if I wanted to

543
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,620
change the shadow to red and the

544
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,480
highlight to yellow these are truly

545
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,220
dynamic variables that is just changing

546
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,250
the style in the browser no longer the

547
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,380
SAS variables that you have to compose

548
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,660
into actual colors first these these

549
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,460
live in your browser so I love those if

550
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,110
you haven't tried them yet check them

551
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,180
out they're great you can use javascript

552
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,220
to change CSS variables and it's super

553
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,710
dynamic I love it um anyway let's talk

554
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,140
about performance so who here agrees

555
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,390
before it's important all of you yeah

556
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,920
all of you there are four talks of

557
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,820
performance at this conference so let's

558
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,170
talk about image performance that's

559
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,610
something that blend modes and filters

560
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,490
can help us out with as well you also

561
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,130
don't need fancy image editing programs

562
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,510
that's an important thing to note when

563
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,580
you're using blend modes filters editing

564
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,440
programs in the browser you can just do

565
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,750
it with your free program here so to

566
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,940
apply this transformation I just opened

567
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,100
up my preview app and I removed the

568
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,590
color now when you remove the color cast

569
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,540
of an image you can get a pretty big

570
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,510
size savings of that image so here is

571
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,820
the example here we're saving 62

572
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,030
kilobytes or 22% of the image size and

573
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,400
this one we're saving 21% of the image

574
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,460
size here we're saving 189 kilobytes so

575
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,230
because image is bigger it's a bigger

576
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,710
payload

577
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,539
that were taking away from the user and

578
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,149
this is 20 percent so on average you get

579
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:54,450
like a 17 to 23 percent image savings I

580
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,710
found by doing this kind of

581
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,020
transformation the black and white

582
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,659
doesn't have to be boring again there's

583
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,850
a ton of we can do by applying filters

584
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,740
and blend modes to our backlight images

585
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,690
to give them those effects that we're

586
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,279
kind of applying to colored images

587
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,860
anyway here's here's that same exact

588
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,039
example where these colors are black and

589
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,169
white with the exact same transformation

590
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,630
applied they look almost identical so

591
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,919
this is probably even close to what you

592
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,960
want meanwhile you're saving image size

593
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,289
for your users by not sending 20% bigger

594
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:29,640
images to them so kind of on that front

595
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,990
I did want to mention this it's about

596
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,049
filters not blend modes this something

597
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:36,480
that I recently was doing some research

598
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,480
on with filters they like to call the

599
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,029
contrast swap technique so essentially

600
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,950
what you're doing is you're removing the

601
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,320
contrast of an image on your own you can

602
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,490
do this in Photoshop to get a linear

603
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,010
transformation of that contrast and then

604
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,200
reapplying it in a browser with CSS

605
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,179
filters so here we're using contrast of

606
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,279
two you're doubling that contrast of

607
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,649
yourself manually removed in Photoshop

608
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:01,140
so this is also a JPEGs do they go this

609
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,059
compression algorithm but you can take

610
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,710
it a step further by doing it manually

611
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,750
yourself in the browser and getting an

612
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,580
effect where you're also saving around

613
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,240
20% of an image savings for your image

614
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,730
that you're sending your users so here's

615
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,669
an example that I just could have put

616
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:20,399
together where I was testing out these

617
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,000
image savings and in here I did also

618
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,309
apply a single filter like a single

619
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,260
transformation to all the images and you

620
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,720
can see that here so that's what the

621
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,039
color looks like that's the image looks

622
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,899
like initially and then I just apply the

623
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:35,549
filter back to it and it's a pretty

624
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,620
similar effect to what I would get at a

625
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,169
much smaller size so you can use filters

626
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,460
and blend modes for performance as well

627
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,690
if you're wondering well what about

628
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,210
paint doesn't that take a lot longer to

629
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,700
then edit your images isn't that more

630
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,490
work load on the browser when I profile

631
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,710
this at a six times CPU slow down I

632
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:59,250
found that the longest paint time

633
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,680
Oh point two seven microseconds so point

634
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,130
zero zero zero to seven seconds browsers

635
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,420
are pretty good this I wouldn't really

636
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,100
be too worried about that unless you

637
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,990
have like a page of like a thousand

638
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,250
images trying to apply this

639
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,760
transformation at a time so back to your

640
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,870
regularly scheduled blend mode

641
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,570
programming back to blend modes this is

642
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,190
me enjoying the beautiful fifteen

643
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,330
minutes of sunshine

644
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,000
I hadn't Singapore but it doesn't really

645
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,520
accurately reflect my trip so let's add

646
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,280
some rain with blend modes you can

647
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,400
dynamically just on the screen do this

648
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,590
kind of thing apply some filters apply a

649
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,230
blur filter screen this onto my image to

650
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,460
get a much more accurate representation

651
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,760
of my trip here it also Ran's me of

652
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,410
those like cinema graphs where we have

653
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,450
an image and one part of the image is

654
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,250
moving while the rest day is still this

655
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,810
is kind of like a layer is moving and

656
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,640
it's it's much more performant to see so

657
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,140
here's a much more peaceful example

658
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,290
where we can add some snow a nice

659
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,960
portrait so I try to recreate this as a

660
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,560
gif and it just is so janky you don't

661
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,390
get the same kind of experience and also

662
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,180
if you look at the image size of this

663
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,520
video blended on top of this image it's

664
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,200
big like don't get me wrong this isn't a

665
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,030
movie like this can be optimized but

666
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,560
just to show you how that compares to a

667
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,890
gif it's like that change you don't want

668
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,480
to use gifts don't use gifts people use

669
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,160
them use videos if you're using gifts

670
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,800
send them like Auto playing videos if

671
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,760
you have to do that

672
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,220
don't use gifts but you can again use

673
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,510
blend modes if you want to kind of

674
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,250
effect live near browser you don't have

675
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,990
to edit after effects like you don't

676
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,580
have to open any video editing programs

677
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,350
you can just play in a medium that we're

678
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,360
all familiar with that we all use every

679
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,280
day so that brings me to creativity and

680
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,990
this is the section in which I want to

681
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,970
highlight the work of some other people

682
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,290
that I found that I thought was really

683
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,720
cool on the web and this is by Jamie

684
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,780
Coulter who uses blend modes as well as

685
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,780
video to create this inkblot modal it

686
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,670
kind of like comes out on the screen in

687
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,040
a very beautiful way you can do this now

688
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,140
on your browser by combining these sorts

689
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,670
of things applying blend modes to a

690
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,790
video this is a great example of

691
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,560
visualization by Archer Kournikova and

692
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,060
if you remember how we learned about the

693
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,220
difference blend mode this visualization

694
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,140
is made possible

695
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,210
because of the difference blend mode you

696
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,400
have animation here and all of the

697
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,040
interaction between those lines as they

698
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,630
blend on top of each other you get that

699
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,160
knocked-out effect it's really

700
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,450
mesmerizing I really like this one and

701
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,830
then finally a deadly story did an

702
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,600
example of e-commerce with blend modes

703
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,520
so this I thought was great like here

704
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,320
you could change the color of the suit

705
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,740
by just clicking and changing it as a

706
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,620
layer on top of this image so you know

707
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,600
what people have to do in the past is

708
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,220
you get the designer that opens up this

709
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,620
image they have to edit every single

710
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,590
color themselves and then apply it and

711
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,330
then send the user every single color

712
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,910
option and again it's just being edited

713
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,410
in Photoshop but you get a mask and you

714
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,730
create it and it's not like the actual

715
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,920
color you'd get when you go shopping but

716
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,990
now you can skip that step and you can

717
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,690
just apply a blend mode to an image and

718
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,510
do it in the browser it's not sending

719
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,300
your user as much data from images and

720
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,140
it's a lot faster I want to note that

721
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,760
this is something that I have seen

722
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,560
increasingly our websites are all

723
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,440
starting to look the same and I wanted

724
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,090
to say like stop getting inspiration for

725
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,680
websites from other websites there's so

726
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,000
much more out there to get inspiration

727
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,760
from from nature from architecture from

728
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,770
art and with blend modes with these

729
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,960
browser capabilities we're now able to

730
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,000
start experimenting a lot more adding

731
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,180
for a lot more creativity in our work

732
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,860
and I want to see more of that in the

733
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,830
web and also I want to notice this just

734
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,390
because it's the norm doesn't mean it's

735
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,300
the best solution so like that example I

736
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,240
showed with the knockout text that might

737
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,920
be what people are using now people

738
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,480
think like we have to use clipping and

739
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,030
we have to use SVG and there's a lot of

740
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,680
different features there there are

741
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,730
solutions that we haven't even

742
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,740
discovered yet because maybe not all

743
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,810
browsers support them yet edge so

744
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,070
there's a lot out there that I'm really

745
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,840
excited to see people discover as they

746
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,530
start to use this more so in conclusion

747
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,050
you should use blend modes because of

748
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,310
simplicity uniformity consistency

749
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,230
performance creativity and finally

750
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,660
empathy I didn't really touch on this

751
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,700
during my talk too much but blend modes

752
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,410
are a way to have a

753
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,360
common ground to speak to your designers

754
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,870
from these are ways that the this is a

755
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,040
language I understand this is something

756
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,260
that you can really correlate and when

757
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,610
you improve your relationship with

758
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,290
designers and with other people that you

759
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,700
work with other teammates

760
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,280
that's when ideas really grow you're not

761
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,440
going to create these new ideas by

762
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,200
working in a silo and by a silo I mean a

763
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,720
skill set silo as well there are things

764
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,010
that you you don't know about because

765
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,390
it's not your background or somebody

766
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,530
else might not know about when you work

767
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,850
together when you have a common language

768
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,220
from which to speak that's when things

769
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,930
can really grow and blossom and create

770
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,820
these things that make the web a better

771
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,000
place that pushed the web forward so

772
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,780
let's make blend modes happen what you

773
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,910
can do is go to WP dev user voice

774
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,490
command upvote them and the next break

775
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,080
is sponsored by Microsoft so what a

776
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,940
better time to do it then on their time

777
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,140
go up vote and finally use blend modes

778
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,510
this is from Greg Whitworth who works on

779
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,340
edge he says personally I recommend

780
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,770
using it on production sites in a

781
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,630
progressively enhanced manner because

782
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,490
they do watch web usage so the more

783
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,350
people use them the more use cases that

784
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,270
we come up with as a community the more

785
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,860
we'll start seeing a more creative

786
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,140
beautiful web that's easier simpler more

787
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,990
performant for our users thank you so

788
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,180
much
