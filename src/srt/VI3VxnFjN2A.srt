00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,859

alright so tonight or today I'm going to

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,599
talk about how we're going to code like

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,049
it's 1999 if you guys want I know you

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,790
don't have interwebs but for later on

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,440
you can follow along I've got a longer

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,890
version of the slideshow here so really

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,890
briefly Who am I once upon a time I used

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,320
to be a civil engineer but I quickly

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,210
became bored with a slow pace of the

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,810
projects I was doing so then I decided

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,000
what industry do I want to be in I think

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,380
I want to be in tech because it's super

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,660
innovative it's super fast paced and so

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,000
I started working in this industry as a

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,820
quote community specialist in other

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,180
words i was doing customer support so i

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,149
totally hated it and i taught myself to

18
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,239
code i would spend nights and weekends

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,000
working on my side projects going to

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,640
hackathons hack nights things like that

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,660
and eventually that led to success and i

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,969
landed a job as a web developer at hot

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,530
pads and i've been working there ever

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,920
since so here we go as a web developer

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,040
my first assignment at hot pads was to

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,409
redesign all of our emails and to make

27
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,330
the mobile friendly and i was like a

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,009
piece of cake no big deal right wrong I

29
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,960
quickly realized that I had no idea what

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,740
I was doing but fortunately i'm here to

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,210
share all of my strategies and my

32
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,570
mistakes with all view so here's my

33
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,049
story about how emails are evil i'm

34
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,369
going to talk a little bit about design

35
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,170
a bunch of things i learned before

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,560
during and after my emails were released

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,189
and a bunch of resources that i found so

38
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,390
first up a little bit about design so

39
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,070
the first thing i wanted to do was to

40
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,930
redesign our welcome email since that

41
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,970
was kind of the punch in the face of our

42
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,600
users it's like hey come to our website

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,640
welcome so what I did was I started

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,560
researching other people's welcome

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,189
emails so I look I scoured my own email

46
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,719
accounts i started signing up for all

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,940
these different services just so i could

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,700
look at their emails a lot of the stuff

49
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,710
is pretty instinctual

50
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,530
but I made a quick list oops so my

51
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,660
favorite email actually comes from indy

52
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,240
gogo it's not a welcome email but it's

53
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,090
just really pretty so let's take a look

54
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,340
at IndieGoGo well it's huge okay so the

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,510
first thing that I notice about this

56
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,940
email was like the huge top anchor logo

57
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,780
ok this emails from indy gogo FYI I

58
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,310
noticed that they also have a lot of

59
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,260
really great content so you see lots of

60
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,040
images less text in general another

61
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,570
great thing they do is all their calls

62
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,780
to action are this bright magenta so you

63
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,930
see URLs here in that color and then all

64
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,260
of these read more buttons and that's

65
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,300
consistent through the email a couple of

66
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,740
other things I noticed is they've got

67
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,560
these social media icons as well as the

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,210
text down here which is really great for

69
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,720
accessibility and then at the very very

70
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,300
bottom of course the unsubscribe and way

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,950
to update your subscription preferences

72
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:30,670
I am trying to switch tabs now

73
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,410
whoops

74
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,940
sorry about that

75
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,849
all right let's go back to my slides or

76
00:03:43,849 --> 00:04:04,460
not

77
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,420
all right everybody take a nap i know we

78
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,230
just had the lunch so yep thank you all

79
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,180
right so from that email and the bunch

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,060
of bunches of emails i was looking at I

81
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,920
had a found a bunch of takeaways and

82
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,480
those are that you want to keep your

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,730
emails texts light you want to keep them

84
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,410
image-heavy just to keep the interest of

85
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,600
your users have that huge top anchored

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,310
logo so people know where your email is

87
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,010
coming from and then also you want to

88
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,510
set a max width on your email you don't

89
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,950
want people reading across the screen

90
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,850
just to see what you want to say alright

91
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,990
so the next thing I wanted to take a

92
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,700
look at was the emails that I'd be

93
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,660
working with so I did and here's the

94
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,610
welcome email from hot pads I was like

95
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,000
oh my god so a couple of things first

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,860
off why is the logo right in the middle

97
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,890
of email I don't know another thing

98
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,630
you'll notice is the spacing is really

99
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,700
inconsistent throughout the email it

100
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,590
doesn't really make any sense why things

101
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,400
are have the margins that they do the

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,900
last thing I noticed was wait where do

103
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,630
you unsubscribe if your user the type of

104
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,220
user who gets really annoyed at all of

105
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,560
these emails pummeling your inbox then

106
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,820
you definitely want to be able to at

107
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,260
least find that unsubscribe no matter

108
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,100
how hard it is to find so basically I

109
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,880
was like dog I was like wow okay so

110
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,910
that's what I'm working with so the next

111
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,320
thing I wanted to do in designing our

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,340
emails was to plan on what I was making

113
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,070
and I had a couple of goals in mind so

114
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,360
the first was to bring a bunch of

115
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,910
consistency to our emails I took a look

116
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,790
at all of our emails across hot pads and

117
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,500
they were all different like the logos

118
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,720
in different places there are different

119
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,570
margins different icons so I was like

120
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,669
all right let's bring some consistency

121
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:52,650
to them and in general having that

122
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,450
consistency will bring brand awareness

123
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,150
again seeing that top anchor blue logo

124
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,220
over and over again will make sure that

125
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,360
your brand is recognizable so another

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,890
thing I took a look at in my planning

127
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,990
was a bunch of pre-made templates I'm

128
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,880
sure a bunch of you guys have seen all

129
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,070
those and there are just lots of options

130
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,599
which I'm going to talk about a little

131
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:15,900
bit later and I actually didn't use any

132
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,340
of them

133
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,770
the reason why was because I was redoing

134
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,110
all of our emails we have a pretty like

135
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,380
specific user base that uses outlook a

136
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,840
lot still so I wanted to make sure I had

137
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,630
something that was customizable also

138
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,729
being that this was the first project I

139
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,800
did as a web developer it was a learning

140
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,540
experience for me and I had a lot of

141
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,970
time on my hands so if you're a company

142
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,100
that doesn't have the time you could go

143
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,600
with a template but if you've got a lot

144
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,280
of time and you need a customizable

145
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,260
solution then I'd recommend just

146
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,460
building your own the next thing I did

147
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,040
was a bunch of sketches so if I've

148
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,600
learned anything from UX it's that

149
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,940
sketching is awesome so you see here

150
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,560
I've actually sketched the same email

151
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,410
four different times and in general when

152
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,300
you do sketch you will find that your

153
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,060
later sketches are much better than the

154
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,919
previous ones so it's good to just do it

155
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,280
over and over again another thing you

156
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,200
can do in planning your design is if

157
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
you've got the skills for photoshop i'd

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,160
recommend it it's great you can have a

159
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,930
quick mock-up so you see here one of the

160
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,760
earlier mock-ups of our wealth of our

161
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,820
welcome email that i did another thing

162
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,590
to keep in mind is what i call the rule

163
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,050
of thumbs so minimum touchable area i

164
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,610
think a lot of people heard the number

165
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,479
44 x 44 pixels this is actually based on

166
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,539
the original iphones human interface

167
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,120
guidelines which actually no longer

168
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,450
exists so wipe that number from your

169
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,700
mind take a look at these links you'll

170
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,080
find a bunch of different minimum

171
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,380
touchable areas for different devices

172
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,849
they vary quite a bit so you probably

173
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,740
want to take a look at the devices that

174
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,620
your users have and then base it on the

175
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,020
largest size all right so here's my

176
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,599
template this is the email i created

177
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,880
from the original one again you'll see

178
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,729
the top anchor logo you'll see the links

179
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,889
are underlined for accessibility as well

180
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:16,919
as color colored differently i changed a

181
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,099
bunch of things for mobile and for

182
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,990
social media so that you have images

183
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,910
instead and again with the text below

184
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,460
for accessibility it's a little bit hard

185
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,590
to see but below that in the footer I'm

186
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,220
mimicking what hot pads

187
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,930
website used to look like it's the same

188
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,120
footer so people kind of see that

189
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,400
consistency from the web on to the

190
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,599
emails so I like to say that it's an

191
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,159
aesthetic that Prince would approve of

192
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,760
and just for reference here's the

193
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,560
original email and then the email that I

194
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,140
designed so they see the content is a

195
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,210
little bit longer in my version but I

196
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,240
think it looks a whole lot better and a

197
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,370
lot of trap or traffic shot up shot

198
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,990
through the roof after the redesign of

199
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,720
this email all right on to code a bunch

200
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,350
of tips and tricks so you can find my

201
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,390
template on github it's just the general

202
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,310
template that I created for the hot pads

203
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,350
emails so why template a great thing

204
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,210
about having a template is that you can

205
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,740
keep your code dry so you're not

206
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,680
repeating yourself so see in my email

207
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,820
what we're calling our little micro

208
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,290
listing it's like the same little block

209
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,880
of code just repeated over and over

210
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,130
again again you'll see the consistency

211
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,770
in the hot pads logo so that people know

212
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,930
where emails coming from as well as the

213
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,140
frame and the footer so a little bit of

214
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,460
abstraction goes a really long way all

215
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,870
right some things that I learned before

216
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,589
I started coding my emails tables are

217
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:52,420
coming Mozilla developer network says

218
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,860
note prior to the creation of CSS HTML

219
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,150
table elements were often used as a

220
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,420
method for page layout this usage has

221
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,670
since been discouraged or excuse me been

222
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,400
discouraged since HTML 4 and the table

223
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,230
element should not be used for layout

224
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:15,160
purposes emails sale ol to that so one

225
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,320
thing I found out was that tables do not

226
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,230
display as inline or block the default

227
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,600
CSS for a table is to display as table

228
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,690
probably makes sense but one thing I

229
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,130
found it is you actually want to specify

230
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,140
your tables to display its block other

231
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,030
chrome otherwise chrome is going to

232
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,050
totally ignore your max width

233
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,950
another thing I learned about we're in

234
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,960
line styles you've got to use them

235
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,060
because most email clients do not

236
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,660
support a head section in your HTML page

237
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,030
there's a CSS excuse me a page on

238
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,860
campaign monitor letting you know what

239
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,110
CSS is supported over different email

240
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,400
clients and also there are actually

241
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,300
really great websites that will actually

242
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,480
put your styles in line for you so

243
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,590
unfortunately you're going to be doing a

244
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,660
lot of this you'll see all of my Styles

245
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,780
in line it's it's a mess but like I said

246
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,500
you've got those tools that can help you

247
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,160
another thing is the max width so you

248
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,800
see here I've got a really wide email

249
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,470
that I received so you're just going to

250
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,690
be just reading across the page so just

251
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,850
take a note from print design you don't

252
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,620
want people reading across the page you

253
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,030
want them to be able to scan with their

254
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,650
eyes so good max with number to keep in

255
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,680
mind is 550 to 600 pixels and that's

256
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,720
based on most email clients preview

257
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,330
pains so quick note about comments

258
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,100
you're going to have tables all the way

259
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,500
down your page tables within tables

260
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,870
within tables for your email so you take

261
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,420
a quick look at the code up here I've

262
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,820
got a couple of comments letting me know

263
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,490
when one table starts and one table ends

264
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,740
and it's a good thing to keep in mind so

265
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,390
use a lot of comments alright another

266
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,630
thing to keep in mind our image alt

267
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,280
alternatives so it's really good to

268
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,940
always have an alt attribute on your

269
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,220
image tags or a background color set on

270
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,440
them it's really good for accessibility

271
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,720
in case the email client isn't going to

272
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,340
display your image oops so you'll see

273
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,040
here gmail is not displaying the hot

274
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,990
pads logo so by having that alt

275
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,300
attribute it's really helpful for users

276
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,400
to see what they are missing out on and

277
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,870
you know if they want to click just to

278
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,280
see the hot pads logo that would be

279
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,660
great another thing again accessibility

280
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,580
so below you'll also see that I've set a

281
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,470
background color on the footer of my

282
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,630
email just in case that image at the

283
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,889
bottom doesn't show you'll see

284
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:52,319
see this nice blue border surrounding

285
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:56,939
the email all right some things I

286
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:01,170
learned while I was coding so media

287
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,009
queries we all love media queries right

288
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:07,980
maybe well they're really great for

289
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,779
things like readability and targeting

290
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,239
specific devices again this talk is

291
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,939
about responsive emails so here you'll

292
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:17,309
want to keep you'll see here that i set

293
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:20,069
a max width on the background table of

294
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:22,470
my email for any device or browser

295
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,879
that's much wider another thing you can

296
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,559
do with media queries is use them in

297
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,509
conjunction with fluid layouts and

298
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,970
percentage based widths so you'll see

299
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,829
here I'm targeting devices that have a

300
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,100
max width of 480 pixels and for any

301
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,629
email clients that actually don't

302
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:42,029
recognize media devices I also have the

303
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,429
table with set to one hundred percent so

304
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:45,449
it's really good to use those in

305
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,919
conjunctions you can hit all those

306
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,589
different email clients and a quick note

307
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:54,059
about media queries so when I was

308
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:56,489
designing these emails I actually focus

309
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:58,980
on the browser first and then had them

310
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,470
degrade over mobile and that's just

311
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,139
because our users mostly were accessing

312
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,649
the emails on route on browser versus

313
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:10,049
mobile devices so it's a little bit hard

314
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,759
to see here it's cut off but you guys

315
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:18,089
can check out those slides later alright

316
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,129
the next thing to keep in mind is again

317
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:22,739
device pixel ratio for your media

318
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:25,439
queries so here I'm targeting all the

319
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:28,410
retina or high res devices and I'll get

320
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:34,439
into that a little bit later okay

321
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:37,199
important when should we use it most

322
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,169
people say never and for me and emails I

323
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:44,999
say sometimes so important here what

324
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,069
you'll see is sometimes your inline

325
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:49,739
styles will be will overwrite your media

326
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,419
queries and you don't always want that

327
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:55,739
to happen so for my mobile devices I've

328
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:58,049
set the header bar to be a height of 5

329
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:01,559
pixels and for browser-based or like

330
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,010
wider devices I

331
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,350
have the header bar set to 10 pixels so

332
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,640
you'll see the inline style will

333
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,350
overwrite the media query so in this

334
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,450
case having important there in the media

335
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,370
query will make sure that the header bar

336
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:18,610
stays small for mobile devices all right

337
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,380
this one's a little bit weird so the

338
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,090
very bottom of this image you'll see a

339
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,690
thin blue line at the bottom of that

340
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,360
footer and I was like what is that where

341
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,920
did that come from why can't I make it

342
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,800
go away well it turns out it was a line

343
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,990
height issue so there are a couple of

344
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,970
solutions that will resolve that for me

345
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,340
and one is to set a line height on the

346
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,440
surrounding column element the other is

347
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,420
to set the image to display as block so

348
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,830
it doesn't interact with those line

349
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,780
heights all right lastly things that I

350
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,000
learned after the release of my emails

351
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,460
whoops so this one is super weird and

352
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,500
only occurs occasionally so occasionally

353
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,560
that I don't even have an example of it

354
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,420
but once in a while your image will

355
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,790
appear with a thin gray border around it

356
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,880
I was like why is that happening and it

357
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,040
mostly only happened in gmail and I

358
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,420
couldn't figure it out until I just

359
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,240
tried something randomly so it turns out

360
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,870
the reason was because I had the image

361
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,930
on a different line than my anchor

362
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,060
element so actually putting them in line

363
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,190
got rid of that border don't ask me why

364
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,200
if you guys see a gray border around

365
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,210
your images and emails now you'll know

366
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:36,070
that this is the solution another thing

367
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,590
I notice was my high-res images for

368
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,810
retina were not being sized down so

369
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,770
people were getting this email which

370
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,270
obviously is not going to make them want

371
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,360
to go to our site so it's like okay what

372
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,330
do I do well the problem is that outlook

373
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,020
2007 1013 and outlook for internet

374
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,260
explorer don't allow for HTML or CSS

375
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,390
resizing of images so there's like oh

376
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,150
great what do I do now well the solution

377
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,970
is to replace your image with a

378
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,680
background image style on the

379
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,079
surrounding column element and then set

380
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,570
the image to display as none and i found

381
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,370
that solution from campaign monitor

382
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,610
so see the code here so up at the top

383
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,399
you'll see for my high res devices that

384
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:24,949
I've set a background image on that

385
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:26,740
surrounding column element and then I

386
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,330
set the image to display as none and

387
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:36,009
you'll see the HTML down here alright

388
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:38,779
another thing I learned was at outlook

389
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:44,870
2007 2010 and 2013 ignore max width so

390
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,549
what you want to do here is have a max

391
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:49,460
width bypass so you'll set a fluid

392
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,129
layout for your baseline elements so

393
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:54,769
you'll see here i set a width fluid

394
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:57,529
width of a hundred percent and then a

395
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,200
media query for any screens that are

396
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,149
larger than that to set a fixed width

397
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:07,730
instead of a max width of 600 pixels so

398
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,460
you may be wondering outlook 2007 10 and

399
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,990
13 WTF well it turns out that the

400
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,750
rendering engines for CH outlook 2002

401
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,669
2003 our intern is internet explorer for

402
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:26,019
2007-2010 in 2013 it's microsoft word

403
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:29,600
yeah and i don't ask me why I would look

404
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,580
2011 they made the right move and they

405
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,379
used WebKit they call it outlook for mac

406
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,480
so the rendering engine is awesome but

407
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,860
then I don't know why they just switched

408
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,470
back in 2013 alright the last thing that

409
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,779
I learned after the release of my email

410
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:47,419
who is that gmail ignores any color

411
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,519
styles on your anchor tags in the head

412
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,279
of your HTML page so you actually have

413
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,460
to go and sell every single anchor tag

414
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:02,299
in line in your email all right now some

415
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:05,179
quick resources so I found all these

416
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:08,179
really great blogs style campaign is a

417
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,299
company run by Anna Yemen you'll see in

418
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:13,490
the background it's kind of faint but

419
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,470
you'll see her device library so she

420
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,419
spends a ton of time on email and

421
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:19,820
marketing it's a really great blog lots

422
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,759
of solutions there litmus is a testing

423
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,010
suite for emails they also have a really

424
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,840
great blog and they take note of

425
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,320
weirdnesses in the

426
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,899
for an outlooks and I think everyone's

427
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,250
pretty familiar with campaign monitor

428
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,230
and MailChimp again they have a really

429
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,289
great blog and they are both online

430
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:42,029
marketing email solutions all right so

431
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:43,679
off to the templates that I had

432
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,480
mentioned earlier so there's herb Inc

433
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,830
the same company that puts out

434
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,409
foundation again campaign monitor and

435
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:50,880
MailChimp have their own templates which

436
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,889
are really great and then there's the

437
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:55,860
HTML email boilerplate by shawn powell

438
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,139
and i don't know if you can see it but

439
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:00,210
it's in the background of this email so

440
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,419
or of this slide and you can see it gets

441
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,639
a little bit complicated so it

442
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,110
definitely takes care of everything you

443
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,970
need but something to keep in mind it's

444
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,129
a lot of code another thing to keep in

445
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:13,110
mind is i just found out that sir pink

446
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,710
actually doesn't support outlook 2007 10

447
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,590
or 13 so they made these great templates

448
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,450
but they took the easy way and then

449
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,690
lastly testing so email on acid and

450
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,049
litmus are really great testing suites

451
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,620
email on acid is free witness is not

452
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,519
unfortunately the company i work for it

453
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,620
has a subscription with knit litmus and

454
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,179
so you may be see that in the background

455
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,970
as well but basically you can send them

456
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,639
an email and they'll display what your

457
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:46,320
email will look like across different

458
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,070
email clients and that's it you guys

459
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,600
have any questions you can speak to me

460
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:58,720
later
