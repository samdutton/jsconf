00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,170

hi so yeah I going to give a talk

2
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,140
entitled playing DVD in JavaScript for

3
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,500
the sake of interoperability so just a

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,539
word by myself so my name is Guillaume

5
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,969
i'm i'm french but i'm living in in

6
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,929
london i'm working at mozilla on firefox

7
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,489
OS but actually this talk is about

8
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,410
personal project is not related in any

9
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,699
way to my work at mozilla so let's I

10
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,590
going to tell you a little bit a little

11
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,790
bit more about myself so I really love

12
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,189
dvds i have some dvds so this is a

13
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:15,950
picture of the main my collection so

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,930
most of it is made of Japanese animation

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,899
and and also I i use google play music

16
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:28,009
and I've noticed that since i started

17
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,229
using will play music that is to encode

18
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:35,509
my CDs and and and and oppose them to to

19
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:38,899
play music I've noticed that I listening

20
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,670
to my cities more often that I used to

21
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,159
when they were just the CDs so and and

22
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,610
and also i love javascript so VI d was

23
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,070
using javascript I going to combine my

24
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,829
passion for DVDs to make something but

25
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:56,990
sees very similar to google play music

26
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,530
but but would that would use dvds

27
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,869
instead of off CD so what I want is

28
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,490
basically I want to service but will

29
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,700
that would stream my DVDs from the cloud

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,790
down to my mobile and eventually and

31
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,239
and hopefully done to my yet don't my

32
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,359
mobile so so what I can enjoy my DVDs

33
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:22,409
when I'm undergo so but why would I do

34
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,840
that because obviously there are

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,420
services like Netflix but the main

36
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,340
problem is I don't want to use metric

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,079
because we offer is too mainstream for

38
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,109
me and I have nothing very interesting

39
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:36,959
for me there and in this case why don't

40
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,730
you just rip the video and put it

41
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,760
somewhere and the problem is dvds is

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,780
more than than just video dvds us a kind

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,659
of multiple video and audio tracks you

44
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,939
can have menu and interactivity you can

45
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,599
build games and karaoke and quizzes so

46
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,730
what I want is I want this all

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,250
experience my brother so not just the

48
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,319
video so this talk is about how i

49
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,329
implemented this in JavaScript and and

50
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:12,540
also what type of issue I I faced during

51
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,889
this implementation so first of all I'm

52
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:19,409
going to just give you another view of

53
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,459
the DVD so yeah as you know now before

54
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,430
on DVDs 10 for versatile not video so

55
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,629
the DVD is it just a format and the DVD

56
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,669
video is a specific application that

57
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,389
uses that format so and during this talk

58
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:39,030
when I when I when I say dvds i will be

59
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,229
obviously referring to a DVD video so

60
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:47,489
the specs so the problem has a problem

61
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,879
with respects of a DVD so it's a

62
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,049
document you have to pay a huge amount

63
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,870
of money to to have access to and also

64
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,479
you have to sign an NDA so if i add that

65
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,449
look if i add a look at the official

66
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,370
specs I wouldn't be able to give that

67
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,689
talk because I would have signed this

68
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,180
NDA and wouldn't be able to talk about

69
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,419
it but fortunately respect has been

70
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:12,419
reverse-engineered from actual discs and

71
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,000
there are open source libraries but

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,870
and execute execute DVDs okay now so if

73
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,180
you if you open the DVD on your computer

74
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,070
you'll notice that there are two folders

75
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,770
one called audio underscore TS which is

76
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,390
optional and most of the time is is

77
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,730
empty and the other one is called video

78
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,540
TS and the one we're going to look

79
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,540
inside so if you open this this folder

80
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,370
you'll notice there are two different

81
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,490
types of file we are info files whose

82
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,390
extension is I for or bub that stands

83
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,930
for backup and we are verb files so we I

84
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,620
for files they contains over the logic

85
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,980
for the playback we contain the menu and

86
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,280
and the chapters all the languages

87
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,680
available and and and all that stuff

88
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,250
Reverb file vote files on the other hand

89
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,190
they contain the video and vo do they

90
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,220
also have subtitles and bedded into and

91
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,450
we also contain the menu and the

92
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,169
position of a button and all that stuff

93
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:29,919
and on on top of that there is a virtual

94
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,710
machine that takes care of all the

95
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,780
interactivity of a DVD so the vm is as

96
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,760
16 registered so it's very similar to

97
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,550
two variables you can set them get the

98
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,530
value you can compare different

99
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,340
registers it has 24 system parameter

100
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,919
register we are like built-in variable

101
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,720
that contain very specific information

102
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,940
about the language currently selected

103
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,979
the region of the DVD active button were

104
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:02,200
parental leave all and all that stuff

105
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,090
and it has 36 comments / commands allow

106
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,150
you to jump to a specific chapter or

107
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,550
select specific menu your menu or

108
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,370
compare different registers or set the

109
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,110
value of a register and it also as a

110
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,840
go-to and and and obviously I go to is

111
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,400
always a pain to implement in JavaScript

112
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,169
just going to show you an example of a

113
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,080
command so comment is actually made of

114
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,189
of eight bytes so it just random numbers

115
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,729
that has to be passed to be understood

116
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,349
so this is silver the first line is a

117
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:44,409
row command as taught in the DVD and the

118
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,710
second line is actually we recommend of

119
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,189
a meaning of recommend so we can broke

120
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:53,979
down the eight bytes so the first free

121
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,379
ones stand over command that's called

122
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:59,110
gem VT spdt so this particular command

123
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,210
is in charge of jumping to a specified

124
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,909
chapter in the current titles so let's

125
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:07,060
say you have a DVD with free let's say

126
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,090
it it's a TV series you are free free

127
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,389
titles free episodes on this series and

128
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:19,479
then in so the second one over ten which

129
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:24,909
in Exodus ml stand is l.a so it's time

130
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,610
for what we call in a DVD land the PTT

131
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,580
which is which is the chapter so and the

132
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,659
number after is equal and then this is

133
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,949
the number of a title so let's say we

134
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,539
have is this DVD with TV series ep the

135
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,719
DVD of Assyria to see read our visit EVD

136
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:47,710
of a TV series so in this case that

137
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,800
would mean jumped over to the tenth

138
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,659
chapter of a third title and then we

139
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,479
have the first parameter that is going

140
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,300
to be compared to the second one so if i

141
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,520
were to ride this is something

142
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,289
equivalent in JavaScript I would get

143
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,449
something like this so we have all

144
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,370
registered in a in a in an array called

145
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,949
GPR em so we compare the value of the

146
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,310
first register to the second register

147
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,580
and if that might be they match then we

148
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,919
we jumped to the title free and there we

149
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,979
then we play the chapter 10 okay good so

150
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:35,409
okay so I saw to that so I wanted to

151
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,750
play DVD in JavaScript so I say okay I

152
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,800
going to play DVD on the fly so I told

153
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,000
you before that we are

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,180
libraries open source libraries but

155
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,640
reverse engineered respects so we are

156
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,280
called live DVD read and live DVD nav so

157
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,610
the first thing I did was to port with

158
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,220
libraries written in C to JavaScript so

159
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,670
I did that manually because it was easy

160
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,310
for me to to understand how it works and

161
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,040
all that all that stuff so the first

162
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,370
experiment I did was I said okay I going

163
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,980
to to redirect give a DVD from the

164
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,470
browser I going to pull the data

165
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,290
directly from the disc so this is the

166
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,080
architecture of his experiments so I

167
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,330
have a DVD disc I have my brother and

168
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,700
the browser just go to the disc and and

169
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,900
try to to to read this disc so what is

170
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,180
asked to do is first we have to to pass

171
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,510
VI for files to understand what to play

172
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,600
what's the logic of other disks so was

173
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,520
very easy because in JavaScript we can

174
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,430
use typed arrays and data view so

175
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,930
passing data to generate something

176
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,710
meaningful in javascript is very easy so

177
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,740
I get it done and then I go to the point

178
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,320
that I need to play verb files so if you

179
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,050
remember the verb files of a father but

180
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,390
that hold the audio and the video and

181
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,790
then I had many issues the first one was

182
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,940
the browser can't play the Codex using

183
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,070
DVD so there are many codec so the video

184
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,820
is always encoded using mpeg-2 and we

185
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,530
are several codecs for the sound

186
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,770
including AAC but known of them are

187
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,370
actually natively readable in the

188
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,930
browser so i coud us try to use

189
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,060
Emscripten to actually compile a decoder

190
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,160
in JavaScript and use it use it use it

191
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,160
from the browser but that's another

192
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,730
issue is that the browser actually very

193
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,780
bad at handling huge files and on a DVD

194
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,200
reverb file can be as big as one gig so

195
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,050
so handling such a huge amount of data

196
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,860
in the browser is simply not possible

197
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,540
in the future we're going to have stream

198
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,660
in the browser so that may be helpless

199
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,490
but in the meantime I couldn't wait for

200
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,079
several years before it's even

201
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,010
implemented or standardized so I try

202
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,230
something else I said okay I can't do it

203
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,390
just using my browser so I going to use

204
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,450
a server the server is going to to sit

205
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,630
between the DVD and my browser and it is

206
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,750
going to be responsible for for taking

207
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,640
the data including the video data from

208
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,709
the browser and and transmit this data

209
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:31,019
to ver tu veux to my to my browser so

210
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,500
this is my updated graph so I have a DVD

211
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,690
like before I have a browser like before

212
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,300
but it in the middle I have a server and

213
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,820
the server communicates with the browser

214
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,540
using binary web sockets and all the

215
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,540
logic is actually taking care by the

216
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,480
browser so the browser is responsible

217
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,240
for running the vm for playing with

218
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,060
playing every from playing the DVD but

219
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,850
it just asked for the server for for the

220
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,589
date i and and then the server does

221
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:05,940
nothing more than just taking the data

222
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,320
from the DVD and sending to the browser

223
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,449
that doesn't work but doesn't work

224
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:15,060
because the main the problem is we play

225
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,560
back is to Turkey's the issue is the

226
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,010
server is actually whenever the browser

227
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,199
requests a video of a server is going to

228
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:27,570
take the original video from the disc

229
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,470
encoded to to a format that's readable

230
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,089
in a browser and send it to a browser

231
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:35,760
the problem is this encoding takes

232
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,130
longer than than than reading so

233
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,130
obviously the browser most of the time

234
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,720
is waiting for data that are being

235
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,630
encoded so I couldn't do like this so I

236
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,089
had to fight to find some something else

237
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:49,890
so I thought ok so what I going to do

238
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,630
now is I'm going to take the video we

239
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,000
are going to encode it to to wear them

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,519
that can be read natively in the browser

241
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,959
and then the server is going to be

242
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,440
responsible for sending the

243
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,060
a video already encoded so I updated my

244
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,550
architecture I've a server instead of

245
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,560
just taking the data from the DVD is

246
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,840
taking the data all the binary data from

247
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,720
the Eiffel files from the DVD and all

248
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,090
the video is taken directly for a pre

249
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,610
encoded file and and the rest of the

250
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,020
architecture is very similar to the

251
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,480
previous experiment and and I was very

252
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,430
happy because it's worked and I was cool

253
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:37,150
but but I had many many many issues for

254
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,460
so first of all the server and the

255
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,320
browser I completely out of sync if the

256
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,420
server is well ahead of the browser so

257
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,490
so yeah that's an issue and also it

258
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,900
needs a very super powerful

259
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,910
configuration because first server

260
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,370
should be super efficient the browser

261
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,460
should should use it only actually it

262
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,280
only worked on modern browser with

263
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,450
experimental flags activated so overall

264
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,990
it was a very fragile implementation and

265
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,970
also because of that powerful

266
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,650
configuration needed I couldn't run in

267
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,810
on on a bra on online online mobile and

268
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,380
if you remember running this thing on my

269
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:25,040
mobile was my main goal so so yeah that

270
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,960
wasn't okay but actually the biggest

271
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,410
issue I have with with this thing is it

272
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,570
it is in the web it isn't aware because

273
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,120
i had to reimplement many things but are

274
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,040
already in the browser like for example

275
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,850
video buffering re-implemented

276
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,500
re-implementing video buffering and

277
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,630
that's a bit ridiculous because it's

278
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,270
already everything is already

279
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,010
implemented in the browser so it's a bit

280
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,150
like if you if you want to do your own

281
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:57,680
image image library and Yuri implement

282
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,010
it on on top of one converso but that's

283
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,900
not that's not good so I had to somehow

284
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,750
reintroduce the web into my project and

285
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,620
to do so I I used a converter so the

286
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,350
idea of a converter

287
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,740
was actually came from the static web

288
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,470
site generator as you know static web

289
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,320
site generators we're quite a hot topic

290
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,630
probably six months ago i'm not sure now

291
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,560
but yeah probably it still and so the

292
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,620
idea was okay i can't read DVD on the

293
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,620
fly so what I going to do is I going to

294
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:41,770
to to use a converter to generate static

295
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,290
assets directly that can be directly

296
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,430
consumed by the browser and it has

297
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,290
several advantages the first one is

298
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,450
obviously that you can offset yourself

299
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,090
because the video is going to take a lot

300
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,090
of place and and server space is quite

301
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,860
expensive so doing cell fasting is

302
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,670
probably a good idea and also i go into

303
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,690
to generate static static assets so i

304
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,170
won't need something i wanted a very

305
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,900
powerful server i mean its control icon

306
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,660
cumbuco i can probably use Leiter your

307
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,130
engine eeks running on top of a

308
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,780
Raspberry Pi and also that will be

309
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,930
mobile friendly because I won't have to

310
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,470
use crazy hacks to to to make it work so

311
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,170
before going into the details of that

312
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,390
particular converter are going to show

313
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,210
you the demo so the day we are going to

314
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,300
show you is a movie called Sita Sings

315
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,180
the Blues it's an animated movie created

316
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,820
by the animator and free culture

317
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,700
activist ninah Paley and she realized

318
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,120
this movie and of a ver cc0 license so

319
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,750
this movie is is is public domain so I

320
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,090
believe it's a completely legal for me

321
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:06,040
to do to show it to you ok so it's the

322
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,400
pre-recording video of so on the

323
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,830
left-hand side varies the original DVD

324
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,940
run on a DVD player in this case it's

325
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,490
VLC media player and on the right-hand

326
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,130
side that's my application that mimics

327
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,860
but the converter of so as you can see

328
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,310
two completely

329
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,620
work in progress if you if you pay

330
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,780
attention to the buttons versity are

331
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,710
still using this gray button with round

332
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,420
corner because I haven't implemented the

333
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,420
overlay passing and and sometime it's a

334
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,200
big it's it's a bit buggy like the menu

335
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,190
are not where they supposed to be and

336
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,480
but however you can still navigate

337
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
through the menu you can start playing

338
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,640
the video and is going to play ad right

339
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,430
chapter VIII chapter you've selected and

340
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,560
obviously you can you can pause it start

341
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,180
it and jump to the next chapter and

342
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,860
doing all that stuff like you would do

343
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,760
in a in an actual actual DVD River River

344
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,480
river with with a normal DVD video

345
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,580
player so how did I do that so when I

346
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,040
started thinking about this converter I

347
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,760
thought okay what I need to do is I need

348
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,360
to map the features of a DVD to

349
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,980
something semantically equivalent on the

350
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,310
web platforms so let's go through all

351
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,140
the features of a DVD and let's find

352
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,260
something similar on the web so first of

353
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,240
all obviously we have a verb files that

354
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,660
contain the video so on the web platform

355
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,430
the equivalent would be the video tag

356
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,640
then we have the subtitles on the web

357
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,390
file and on the web platform we have the

358
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,660
track the track tagged and for webvtt

359
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,480
format for supplied for adding subtitles

360
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,640
to to a video some DVDs can can be

361
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,440
multi-angle that means we have multiple

362
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,720
stream of video and can have multiple

363
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,380
audio tracks so what we can use is the

364
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,020
API call media controller have your word

365
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,700
of media controller yeah ok 1 / 2 maybe

366
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,460
so the thing is beta controller is an

367
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,820
API to sync several video and several

368
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,400
audio stream together so let's say you

369
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,380
have free video and two toward you

370
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,450
stream you can using this this

371
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,680
this API you can keep up in sync it's

372
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,340
only implemented in in Chrome but it has

373
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,400
been i believe it's now only active you

374
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,580
can only enable it using using a flag

375
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,430
server yeah it is yeah it's still very

376
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:57,370
experimental then we are the chapters on

377
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,980
a DVD and we equivalent on on the web

378
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:06,520
would be would be a track track tagged

379
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,300
with the kind attribute attribute being

380
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,040
chapters then anh vui we have money

381
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,690
buttons so obviously we're going to

382
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,450
implement them using the button tag and

383
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,760
and n PNG because on a DVD the buttons

384
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,900
are they use actually an overlay that is

385
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,570
like a four color images with with

386
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,430
transparency so that's very well

387
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,760
convenient to to implement it using PNG

388
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,230
so that's the part actually I actually

389
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,110
haven't worked on so that's why if you

390
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,230
remember on the video I I the office big

391
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,120
ugly grey buttons anyway and and we have

392
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,780
a DVD vm but we need somehow to to

393
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,270
reimplement on the browser so obviously

394
00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:00,720
we're going to use javascript ok cool so

395
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,930
so at this point I i have have a way to

396
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,840
to mimic the features of a DVD and to

397
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,260
make it work on on the browser so i

398
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,120
started working on line on my converter

399
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,160
so this converter is actually made of

400
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,580
several several steps and and the first

401
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,280
step is so all the iphone 5 i'll pass to

402
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,830
Jason so I just pass it pass these five

403
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,500
once and when I can just use with Jason

404
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,480
to to read the data as very convenient

405
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,350
but then all the sharp the chapters are

406
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,330
the information above the chapters on

407
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,630
the DVD are stored in VI for files so i

408
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,190
take this jason and

409
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,470
I generate webvtt files that I going to

410
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,750
to use in my in my browser for for the

411
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,460
chapters of a video then I extract was

412
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,159
what's called Nath packet so basically

413
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,669
there are data packets embedded into the

414
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:11,470
video stream and they contain several

415
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,700
things like the button overlays button

416
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,809
logic button coordinates and size and

417
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,429
all that stuff so I first of all I just

418
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:24,039
extract these these packets and pass

419
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:27,190
them to Jason form to make it easier to

420
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,789
handle later then I extract the button

421
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:32,500
size and position and obviously are

422
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,750
going to save this using CSS I just

423
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:42,090
create static CSS file holding V

424
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,700
whatever is is related to the position

425
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,830
of the buttons then the menu the menu

426
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,919
are made of static images so the easiest

427
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,110
way to do is to extract them and save

428
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,539
them to to PNG but the browser can read

429
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:03,600
them natively and and and obviously

430
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,889
regarding the vm i have 2x try for

431
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:08,620
comments and and compile them to to

432
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,629
javascript and yeah DVD comments are can

433
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:16,840
be stored in multiple location on the

434
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,539
disc so i have to somehow cover all this

435
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,000
command compile them to javascript and

436
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,460
and create a huge javascript file so

437
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,149
that the browser can execute it whoops

438
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:31,779
and then obviously at the end i encode

439
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,399
the video to wear them so wide browser

440
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:40,000
will be able to to to play it for

441
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,980
playing the DVD i created a web

442
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,309
component that I called X video so it's

443
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:47,590
basically like an enhanced video player

444
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:52,299
vai can do chapters playlist menu and so

445
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:53,919
that's what was very convenient for me

446
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,529
because it could take all that burden

447
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:58,919
out of my application and I could just

448
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,539
generate my static

449
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:06,279
set and send them to turn to xvideo and

450
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,619
I would just make it easier to develop

451
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:11,979
and and obviously this component is

452
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:13,659
completely independent and you can use

453
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:19,570
it without this DVD application so doing

454
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,299
working on like that project I were I

455
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:26,769
learn many things so as I told you the

456
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,419
browser at the moment we are not

457
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:31,350
powerful enough to play DVD on the fly

458
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:35,139
but the web platform is is quite

459
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:39,479
powerful because because it it's a

460
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,729
browser can play an application as

461
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:45,429
complex as a DVD natively it has already

462
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:47,830
everything so but that's great and also

463
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,989
if we use javascript we can pass binary

464
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:56,109
binary files like we can play mp3 you

465
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:59,139
can read PDF we can emulate flash and

466
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:01,570
now we can even play DVD so that's

467
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,729
that's something great i think i'm and

468
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:10,210
and also the web is versatile like

469
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,119
remember of in dvds 10 for versatile and

470
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,460
the web is versatile as well because it

471
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,960
has many element that you can recombine

472
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,359
together to create something a richer

473
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:25,029
experience and and yeah what I loved

474
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:27,820
also is the web can be used to give some

475
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,429
kind of second life to all formats like

476
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:36,279
like a DVD so yeah that's it I'm almost

477
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,869
done so if you want to have a look at

478
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,359
the other code it's hosted on github

479
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,440
just go to to this address it's is

480
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,720
actually on you have to go to work to

481
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,249
the branch called converter and all the

482
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,440
first implementation I've show you with

483
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,269
a plane trying to play DVD on the file

484
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:56,919
is on the master branch and all the

485
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:59,679
converter is on the converter branch so

486
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,139
what's next obviously it's still work in

487
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:03,999
progress so in the future I'd like to

488
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:08,220
make it more more feature complete like

489
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,259
porting all the commands and all that

490
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,509
stuff so if you want you to help don't

491
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:15,010
hesitate to simple request

492
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:20,110
very happy and so yeah maybe in the

493
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,540
future I'll be able to to play blu-ray

494
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,080
disc and why not so oh yeah I have I

495
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,700
have a boner because obviously it's a

496
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,980
talk about the DVD so like like any good

497
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,670
DVD I have to I have to to have a bonus

498
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,790
so in this in this case are going to to

499
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,350
show you the application are going to

500
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,830
show you is actually it's actually the

501
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,940
web is not just something some fig thing

502
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:54,220
okay so there we go okay so this is for

503
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,440
example a button so we are going to

504
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,640
inspect it so as you can see I'm not

505
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,370
lying to you it's it's it's a real input

506
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:08,050
tag with always information about this

507
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,170
size and the position of a button is

508
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,340
generated into a static JavaScript and

509
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,230
the background here is it's just an

510
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:22,060
image an image tag with a PNG that has

511
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,620
been extracted from from a DVD and yeah

512
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,940
can I can use it to navigate to go to go

513
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:37,440
to navigate through the menu and and

514
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,980
yeah I can also play the movie why not

515
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:47,410
so whoops what what just happened okay I

516
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,730
know I must have clicked face anyway I'm

517
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,830
almost done yeah I'm actually done
