1
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,050

I'm gonna talk about optimizing for

2
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,640
developer delight I am NOT going to talk

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,960
about there's no right answer because

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,970
Pete and Andrew kinda already did that

5
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,750
justice earlier today and I just worked

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,369
on that talk for a month and it wasn't

7
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:32,920
going anywhere so I wrote this instead

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,260
these days i work at bazaarvoice i'm a

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,640
senior software engineer at bazaarvoice

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,190
where alex is working for another little

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,370
bit so i said the whole currently thing

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,010
and i work on the client-side framework

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,100
that powers the ratings and reviews and

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,650
lots of other applications of our core

15
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,680
application is a ratings and reviews

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,239
third-party javascript widget so if you

17
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,110
are big retailer then and you want to

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,350
have reviews on your site then you might

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,059
use the Bazaarvoice ratings and reviews

20
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:07,460
product in order to get reviews on your

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,780
site without you having to write all

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,720
that code yourself and i'm working on

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,180
the framework that underlies the new

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,229
version of this system of the software

25
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:20,810
and there's a huge motivation to get our

26
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,420
customers switched over to this new

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,659
version the legacy version long story

28
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,670
short kind of requires a lot more effort

29
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,450
on our part I could talk about that and

30
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,689
the 4000 XML tag options that you can

31
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,180
set in the old version but it won't of

32
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,710
its didja law or effort that goes into

33
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,560
configuring the old legacy version of

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,539
the software and the new version of the

35
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:47,240
software is configurable by the client

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,429
rather than by us and so long story

37
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:52,219
short we want clients on it because that

38
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,560
means less work for the same amount of

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,899
money that's pretty cool so of course

40
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,429
customers don't want to switch to the

41
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:00,799
new version of the software until the

42
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,869
new version has all the same features as

43
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,240
the old version has and you know word

44
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,740
we're negotiating on some of that but

45
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,119
they're still our features that we need

46
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,060
to build out because they existed in the

47
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,950
old software they were important to

48
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,230
clients in the old software and before

49
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,160
they're willing to sign on the dotted

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,319
line to switch over the new version they

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,210
need those features there and said

52
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,180
bottom line the easier I can make it for

53
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,370
developers to create new features on top

54
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,010
of this framework in the new system the

55
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,940
easier I can make it

56
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,800
them to do that the more money we make

57
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,200
faster so that's kind of the point of

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,060
this talk today and to give you a sense

59
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,130
of scale of the framework and the

60
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,710
application we're talking about kind of

61
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,320
about twenty five thousand lines of code

62
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,600
for the core application and framework

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,260
another 10,000 or so lines of tests unit

64
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,240
tests and functional tests and if you

65
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,740
throw in all the vendor libraries and

66
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,750
templates and tooling the development

67
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,150
server and all these other pieces then

68
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,560
you get up to about ninety thousand

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,350
lines of code so this isn't enormous

70
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,730
like this is not gmail but it's big it's

71
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,560
probably the biggest application that

72
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,900
I've had the opportunity to work on so

73
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,700
it's big enough and there are some

74
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,540
issues that arise when you have a piece

75
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,970
of software that's this big being worked

76
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,640
on this by this many developers and

77
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,830
being worked on by developers of

78
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,630
different JavaScript skill levels

79
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,160
everyone is our voice is really smart

80
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,290
but some of them came from Java some of

81
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,270
them came from Python some of them came

82
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,040
from who knows where I like to make fun

83
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,330
of the job of people but they're still

84
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,959
nice to me so I appreciate that and and

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,550
so a whole bunch of different people a

86
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,420
whole bunch of different JavaScript

87
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,850
skill levels and of course also doing

88
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,560
this all under the pressure of deadlines

89
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,620
and we had a particularly large deadline

90
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,940
before I started working there in

91
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,220
November and I sort of come here in

92
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,660
February the deadline was in November

93
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,709
and a whole lot of stuff happened that

94
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,940
some people may not be particularly

95
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,010
proud of in hindsight but we've all been

96
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,780
there too so I want to make clear that

97
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,640
none of this talk is like oh those dumb

98
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,590
people are our voice I had to go fix all

99
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,470
their no um they wrote good code

100
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,760
but they did a lot they did a lot of

101
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,570
this under pressure and so decent site

102
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,220
decent-sized code bases with lots of

103
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,019
developers working on them are

104
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,030
definitely interesting creatures because

105
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,440
even if you have a whole bunch of really

106
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,900
smart people working on them you still

107
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,240
can end up with people making decisions

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,880
that are in the interest of the feature

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,310
that they're working on today and not

110
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,180
making decisions based on the interests

111
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,890
of the code base as a whole or the

112
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,060
developer who's going to be working on

113
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,520
another feature tomorrow or next week or

114
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,490
next month and so even really smart

115
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,520
people can may

116
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,960
decisions that are good in the narrow

117
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,690
case but cause problems down the road

118
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,970
for other people and so what I want to

119
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,409
talk about today is this idea of

120
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,300
developer delight which is probably

121
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,550
overstating it a little bit I don't know

122
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,470
that anyways like yay I get to work with

123
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,110
this code I am I'm pretty excited about

124
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,400
working with this code but I might be

125
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,669
weird so developer delight developer

126
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:10,830
happiness there are lots of things that

127
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,870
make us happy money is one and time off

128
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,130
and you know there's lots of things that

129
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,300
are out of my control that make

130
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,460
developers happy but the things that are

131
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,520
in my control in this code base and in

132
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,039
this job number one getting a clear path

133
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,319
for getting people up to speed that was

134
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,759
one of the first things that I focused

135
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,919
on when i started at bazaarvoice was i

136
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,229
don't know where to start how do i make

137
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,509
this easier for the next person how do i

138
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,569
make it so that Alex doesn't that the

139
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:41,219
onboarding process isn't alex sitting in

140
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:42,810
our room with me for three hours

141
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,460
explaining everything that i need to

142
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,409
know how do we make the onboarding

143
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:49,370
process for this framework more more

144
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,639
automated more more self-serve kind of

145
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,199
thing number two how do we make sure

146
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,740
that we don't need all senior software

147
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,050
engineers working on developing features

148
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,090
because you there's probably a lot of

149
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,800
senior senior software engineers in this

150
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,990
room you know how many recruiting emails

151
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,759
you're getting there aren't enough of us

152
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,130
we can't that can't be our answer is Oh

153
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,080
we'll just find isn't matter we're

154
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,889
willing to pay we can't find them and

155
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,969
number three we want to make sure there

156
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:20,099
is few surprises as possible we want the

157
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,620
it just works we don't want there to be

158
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,409
any well I tried this nut didn't work

159
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:27,599
and then I put this variable here and or

160
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:28,949
I put this argument here and then

161
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,240
suddenly it worked so i'm just going to

162
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,430
commit that move on wait a lot of that

163
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,990
and we're trying to get away from that

164
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,029
we want to isolate complexity so you

165
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,190
don't have to understand the crazy

166
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,199
mechanisms that we use in order to do

167
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,169
our event binding which is a whole other

168
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,240
talk that andrew de pont could give

169
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,409
because he wrote all that for us

170
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,240
recently we don't want to have you

171
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,529
wouldn't want developers to have to

172
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:51,240
understand the complex purchase the

173
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,919
framework we want to make it really easy

174
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,070
so they can develop features we want the

175
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,480
development process to be

176
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,730
is seamless and for them to have the

177
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,140
information that they need they don't we

178
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,250
don't want them to have to go digging

179
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,650
for it and finally nothing should be

180
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,560
more difficult than it should be you

181
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,440
know we can't make everything easy but

182
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,360
we can make it so that nothing is harder

183
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,150
than it needs to be and so those are

184
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,210
kind of the goals that I set out for

185
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,920
myself when I joined in February my job

186
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,110
like I said or maybe I didn't save my

187
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,730
job when I joined was not to develop

188
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,220
features not to fix bugs but was to

189
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,710
focus on making this a better experience

190
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,210
for people and that's what I want to

191
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,500
talk about today is kind of what I've

192
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,020
done and things that I think are

193
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,030
generally applicable not just to our

194
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,770
code base that we're working on but to

195
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,890
any large project that has a number of

196
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,510
developers of different skill levels

197
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,030
working on it and deadlines like the

198
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,290
deadline part kind of goes without

199
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,150
saying there's always pressure there's

200
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,430
always deadlines so that's why I want to

201
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,600
talk about some of the things that I'm

202
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,450
going to talk about are so simple that

203
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,550
you might not think to do them because

204
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,350
they're so easy and some of them are a

205
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,750
little bit more complex so i just gotta

206
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,450
you know 22 minutes left so let's dive

207
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,580
in and one of the simplest things that

208
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,300
we did was to add assertions to the

209
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,280
framework so simply to say i expect this

210
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,830
thing to be true at this moment and so

211
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,240
how many of you have been you know

212
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,420
working on a feature in a project you've

213
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,550
seen something like this right like

214
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,960
anyone who doesn't put up their hand is

215
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,190
just lazy because it's the end of the

216
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,169
day so you've all seen this and this is

217
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,000
not a useful error of course there's a

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,380
lot you can go dig up the line number

219
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,330
and see what happened but maybe this

220
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,500
happened is the result of some

221
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,290
asynchronous operation and so you really

222
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,360
have to go trace back where things went

223
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,180
wrong we added just these really simple

224
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,850
assertions to our code base to say I

225
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,520
expect that right now that config is an

226
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,500
object I expect that it has a property

227
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,380
of subject ID and if these two things

228
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,640
are wrong blow up please make noise now

229
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,370
rather than 400 milliseconds from now

230
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,020
when the Ajax requests that gets fired

231
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,510
three lines later finally responds and

232
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,570
so just

233
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,700
adding these was really simple it's just

234
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,450
you know we have this bv reporter a

235
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,340
beauty reporter object that has this

236
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,410
assert method on you can bring your own

237
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,940
assertion you can write your own really

238
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,550
simple assertion function you can bring

239
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,620
chai or any other assertion library cut

240
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,570
it doesn't matter this is this is kind

241
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,520
of the simplest and dumbest thing that

242
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,620
you can possibly do but the nice thing

243
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,170
about this is that with these assertions

244
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,600
you figure out and some of them are

245
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
actually a lot more do they explain in

246
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,680
much more detail what went wrong and

247
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,840
even very easily zero in on where you

248
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,210
have screwed up of course these are all

249
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,820
know ops in production so in production

250
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,030
we just catch our errors and fail

251
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,370
silently as far as the user is concerned

252
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,900
or even gracefully if if we're good next

253
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,710
thing is to I'm pressing the back button

254
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,520
there we go the next thing and which is

255
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,740
also really deceptively simple is to

256
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,320
tell people what's going on you know we

257
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,290
have this 25 thousand lines of code the

258
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,000
the framework is smaller than that but

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,710
does a whole lot of crazy things like I

260
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,720
was saying as far as event delegation as

261
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,670
far as how it sets up the views and

262
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,070
everything so just telling people what's

263
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,920
going on is a huge win when I showed up

264
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,680
this is what I saw in the console when

265
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,770
you pressed refresh essentially nothing

266
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,300
it doesn't matter what that says it's

267
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,040
just like hey I thought this is a font

268
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,530
and it's a font but I'm going to be

269
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,380
grumpy about it and so this is what I

270
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,670
saw this is what you would see in the

271
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,400
console when I showed up and if you

272
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,870
wanted to understand what was going on

273
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,520
especially as a new person working on

274
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,980
this framework it was up to you to put

275
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,200
in console.log statements all throughout

276
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,430
the code and then to make sure of course

277
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,080
that you deleted them all before you

278
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,700
commit hit or else Aaron for sander

279
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,850
would fix it on his branch and and it

280
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,560
was really cute branch it's like he has

281
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,340
kenny powers and he has um lynchburg is

282
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,400
his other his other branch for fixing

283
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,620
things to make you feel guilty so if you

284
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,720
if you if you want to find out what was

285
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,900
going on then it was up to you to put

286
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,910
those logs in to take them out and then

287
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,520
the next developer who came around with

288
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,840
we gonna put it in exactly those same

289
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,540
hugs to figure out was going on and then

290
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,100
have to take them out and it's

291
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,750
especially hard to understand what's

292
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,800
going on when you're dealing with an

293
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,360
asynchronous system where things are

294
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,780
happening later and you know there isn't

295
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,440
just a clear procedural chain of events

296
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,420
so we added lifecycle logging and

297
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,010
especially probably the most exciting

298
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,020
thing is these groups that we added

299
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,350
chrome devtools has console group and

300
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,990
console group end I other devtools may

301
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,420
have it as well we wrote this so that if

302
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,010
it doesn't find console group and

303
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,420
console group end then I'll just fall

304
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,820
back to normal console.log but what this

305
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,090
gives us is a nested view of everything

306
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,710
that's happening and so when we're

307
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,290
building this really complex view

308
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,710
hierarchy we can see exactly how that

309
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,210
happens and we're build it and you

310
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,640
anything that happens kind of in groups

311
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,250
we can see when that starts and when

312
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,670
that ends and so now when you are trying

313
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,960
to figure out where something's going

314
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,710
wrong you can put in one console log and

315
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,660
you can see exactly where that's

316
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,450
happening in the whole chain of events

317
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,010
and we also set up different log levels

318
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,840
so that if you don't want to see this

319
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,390
much detail this is actually an

320
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,850
abnormally high level of detail if you

321
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,050
don't want to see this much detail you

322
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,540
don't have to and so in a more normal

323
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,910
log level you would see more basic and

324
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,730
important information and again this is

325
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,710
really great for newcomers because when

326
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,210
they press when they get that server

327
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,800
running for the first time and see the

328
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,240
application running for the first time

329
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,500
they can see exactly what's happening be

330
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,090
like huh let me go look at that code

331
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,310
that does that it's also great for

332
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,950
debugging because as someone who knows

333
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,080
the framework you kind of learn what you

334
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,540
learn what this flow looks like you put

335
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,160
in your log message and you immediately

336
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,750
know where or something broke liga Tory

337
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,630
sniffle this one's a bit more complex

338
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,110
it's kind of a hard concept to explain

339
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,330
its kind of the more you do this the

340
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,720
more you know what this means that

341
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,220
eliminating temptation again you've got

342
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,680
lots of different developers possibly of

343
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,140
different skill levels working against a

344
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,420
deadline you want to eliminate

345
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,430
opportunities for them to make bad

346
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,730
decisions now in our case there are

347
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,870
probably lots of different kinds of

348
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,430
temptations but in our case our

349
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,360
particular temptation was a global it

350
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,370
was this you know we use AMD so there

351
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,709
aren't really any Global's well there

352
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,870
are but that's a whole thing there

353
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,190
aren't really any Global's but we had

354
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,060
this thing called env capital to make

355
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,380
you know that it was really important

356
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,010
and it was a dependency in just about

357
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,430
every single file in the entire code

358
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,320
base some files didn't actually use it

359
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,940
we actually we have scaffolding a

360
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,589
scaffolding tool like when you need a

361
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:14,610
new feature when you want to make a new

362
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,560
feature you see me a new feature and it

363
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,029
would automatically just be like you're

364
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:19,709
probably going to need env so I'm just

365
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,260
going to put it there for you it turns

366
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,700
out that this is really a bad idea

367
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,959
because if you give this global to

368
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,779
people they will find all kinds of ways

369
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,529
to take advantage of it in a really bad

370
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:36,420
way and so the next thing you know the

371
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,279
solution become this is this global kind

372
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,690
of becomes the solution for everything

373
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,399
so it was a global event bus for us okay

374
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,380
it was an error aggregator so whenever

375
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,640
there was an error we would fire another

376
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,529
event and that did something else we'd

377
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:52,290
send the error along to it was also how

378
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,880
we pass through analytics stuff that was

379
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,270
going on yeah cool um anything that we

380
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,350
couldn't figure out a better place to

381
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,720
put it and be seems like a good place

382
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,899
for it it was also this magical third

383
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,890
argument to on trigger set and get and I

384
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,500
I don't know that there's any what I can

385
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,899
tell you now what that did but when I

386
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,430
showed up I don't know if there's anyone

387
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,860
who could like any single person who

388
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,560
could tell you exactly what that did of

389
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,579
course there were no test for it either

390
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,970
so so we one of the things that I did I

391
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,279
saw this envy is just like the scourge

392
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,390
on the code base and I spent months

393
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,220
I finally got rid of almost all of the

394
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,210
env s just last week I spent months the

395
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,760
last few months trying to eliminate this

396
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,740
from the code base and so maybe you

397
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,380
implement things via a global but that

398
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,580
doesn't mean you need to expose the

399
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,750
global to every single every single

400
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,360
module every single piece of code so now

401
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,610
instead of saying envy trigger show

402
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,070
loading we have a loading overlay object

403
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,550
that we say hey show yourself now and it

404
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,430
may be implemented through envy trigger

405
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,050
show loading maybe it doesn't I don't

406
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,660
remember doesn't matter to that

407
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,810
temptation of env isn't there anymore we

408
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,170
create a BD tracker object that has an

409
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,030
error method and a conversion method a

410
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,320
bunch of other things so any time that

411
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,940
we want to track that something has

412
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,910
happened we now do that in the code

413
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,660
through BB tracker we eliminated the

414
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,090
magical envy arc which is a whole long

415
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,390
story basically it was a weird pub

416
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,730
subsystem and so we said hey let's make

417
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,710
methods called publish and subscribe and

418
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,680
they achieve that same thing but hide

419
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,880
the fact that they're doing it they're

420
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,280
not doing it through env anymore but

421
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,900
even when they were doing it through env

422
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,910
they hid that inside of the methods so

423
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,220
that developers weren't kind of having

424
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,430
to figure out what this magical env as

425
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,190
the last argument meant or what it did

426
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,110
we gave them a method that was what it

427
00:16:54,110 --> 00:17:00,080
did and you one isolated that complexity

428
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,900
and to eliminate that temptation of oh

429
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,160
and these here let me just use it

430
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,000
another thing that we did was to another

431
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,430
kind of rule that I'm trying to enforce

432
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,500
on the code base is this idea of having

433
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,220
code for every concept and so if there's

434
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,820
a concept that you talked about that you

435
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,829
use when you describe how your

436
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,050
application works to another developer

437
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,810
they ought to be able to go in the code

438
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,490
and see the code for that concept and so

439
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,470
we saw this just a second ago with BB

440
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,090
tracker where we have this concept of

441
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,040
tracking when a user does something and

442
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,000
tracking when there's an

443
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,370
her and so before there was no one place

444
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,660
where they could go and see all the

445
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,130
different things that we could track and

446
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,480
how we track them and what the signature

447
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,520
was to do it and all that now we have

448
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,340
this BB tracker object which is where a

449
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,380
developer can go and learn about this

450
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,540
and now there are tests so we know that

451
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,360
it works and so having a code for this

452
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,210
concept of tracking makes it easier to

453
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,100
understand and makes it so you don't

454
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,690
need to know so much about how it works

455
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,620
under the hood in our application we use

456
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,810
these configurable components so this is

457
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,510
an example of a portion of a component

458
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,840
configuration for a review content list

459
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,670
and in when I showed up we had we were

460
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,170
passing around these raw objects so when

461
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,740
we needed to you know initialize a view

462
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,820
for a component we had this in it object

463
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,970
that had an annuity vez raw component

464
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,060
object and use that to initialize the

465
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,740
view of course we stored all these are

466
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,330
all component objects on env shocker and

467
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,840
and so we when I should have not want to

468
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,030
know like what is a component like what

469
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,890
does that mean how do we use them how do

470
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,620
they is this a component or is this like

471
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,690
part of a component I don't understand I

472
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,170
was really really confused and we were

473
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,300
using this term all the time to talk

474
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,310
about how our application worked you

475
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,390
know the Alex would say we have

476
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,800
components and they have features that

477
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,140
but I couldn't go into the code and see

478
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,790
what the heck of component was I just

479
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,760
saw these objects being passed around

480
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,740
and then and at but they there was no

481
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,760
thing that was a component and so a huge

482
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,080
part of the time that I've spent is

483
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,360
actually making this component be a

484
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,960
thing be a documented thing be a tested

485
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,940
thing so that now when you're a new

486
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,470
developer you can go see when we're

487
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,940
talking about components you can go see

488
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,900
the code that is making that whole

489
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,120
system that is the underpinning of our

490
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,040
framework we can see the code that's

491
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,950
making that work and so now we iterate

492
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,350
over the array of component objects and

493
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,260
we make a new component and then we tell

494
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,290
the component to an it it's

495
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,510
you rather than having this view

496
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,850
function that might be totally separated

497
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,110
from something else that we do with

498
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,700
components now everything that we do

499
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,360
with components is a method on the

500
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:11,540
component class dirty words sorry

501
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,320
another thing that we've done that I

502
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,050
can't emphasize enough is to automate

503
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,660
everything no matter what this XKCD

504
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,670
comic says automate everything

505
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,260
especially when you're working with a

506
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,350
large team large code base with a bunch

507
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,930
of developers of different skills we are

508
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,860
most of the people in this room are

509
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,180
probably really good troubleshooters

510
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,830
you're probably really good at figuring

511
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,360
it when something doesn't work on the

512
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,670
command line you might be pretty good at

513
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,180
figuring out why that is people of all

514
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,400
different skills will have strengths in

515
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,160
some areas not in others and so the more

516
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,220
you can automate these wrote tasks the

517
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,320
better off you'll be so one thing that

518
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,870
we have is this internal tool I can't

519
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,810
emphasize enough make one of these make

520
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,630
an internal tool that you throw in a

521
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,210
client name and it pulls up the whatever

522
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,440
information you might need about a

523
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,270
client their configuration a demo a

524
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,240
preview of their site a preview of their

525
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,090
site using development code whatever so

526
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,140
we have this tool and the great thing

527
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,820
about having this tool that automates

528
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,280
these tasks that otherwise they would be

529
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,370
going into the new admin tool clicking

530
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,410
on this including the old process for

531
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,000
doing some of the things on this page

532
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,640
was like a lot of clicking and now

533
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,020
there's not so much clicking you just

534
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,790
type something in boom you have we need

535
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,280
on the page very developer focused

536
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,550
rather than end user focused or customer

537
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,920
focused or non technical person focused

538
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,600
like this is a developer focus tool is a

539
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,130
tool focused on making it easier for

540
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,010
developers to do their job and the great

541
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,480
thing is that once you have a tool like

542
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,030
this you won't think twice about adding

543
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,770
more things to it so once you go through

544
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,110
that hard work of setting up this is the

545
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,240
first funk piece of functionality and a

546
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,100
tool like this then you won't think

547
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,040
twice about now you have this place

548
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,170
where I want to have performance graphs

549
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,450
of different instances Oh we'll put that

550
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,330
in what we

551
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,680
FBI Firebird inspector I want to have I

552
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,920
want to see how many errors there are on

553
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,570
clients or I want to see how many page

554
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,680
views are on clients well let's throw

555
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,120
that in Firebird inspector will throw

556
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,790
that data in there we weren't happy with

557
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,740
just that though so we've used grunt to

558
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,270
automate a lot of this on the command

559
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,980
line in addition so now you can just say

560
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,650
hey give me a preview URL for this

561
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,840
client in the QA environment and it'll

562
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,210
spit out how you can get to all of that

563
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,090
data so grunt is amazing for this sort

564
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,760
of automation we also have tasks for

565
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,040
scaffolding a new feature like I said so

566
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,420
just like in rails land where you say

567
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,730
rails G and it generates you all the

568
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,860
code you need for a new feature you can

569
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,860
say grunt feature and then the feature

570
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,100
name and it will generate code to get a

571
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,260
basic working feature into the system

572
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,140
for you we of course odd mate running

573
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,630
our tests and we automate getting there

574
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,940
getting our environment back to a happy

575
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,620
place because sometimes you'll get your

576
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,930
environment into a sad place and you

577
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,580
need to kind of blow away all of your

578
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,980
config files and all these things were

579
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,420
things that you know the some of them

580
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,800
existed when I showed up some of them

581
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,240
we've added since I showed up it's it's

582
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,400
all just a matter with the automation

583
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,750
especially it's all just a matter of

584
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,790
listening to the people around you and

585
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,310
what is hard for them and either giving

586
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,490
them a gentle not a gentle nudge to fit

587
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,650
to automate whatever they just struggled

588
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,530
through or doing it yourself if you're

589
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,020
lucky enough to be in a role like mine

590
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,940
where that's my job to do that you

591
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,250
already probably know you should be

592
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,870
documenting everything right I don't I

593
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,340
don't actually agree that you should

594
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,770
necessarily document everything I think

595
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,760
that well written codes it's modularized

596
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,610
and small methods that do one thing and

597
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,630
do one thing well you know doing all of

598
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,690
that will alleviate a lot of the need

599
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,870
for say API documentation developers

600
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,640
should be able to go read code to figure

601
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,530
out how code works but there are some

602
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,510
things that even the best code can't

603
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,940
tell you and so document is a kind of

604
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,280
rationale behind your tool the high

605
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,530
level of this is how

606
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,360
it works this is the problem we're

607
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,880
trying to solve and this is at a very

608
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,850
high level this is how we solved it

609
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,020
document how to do things how do I make

610
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,150
a new feature you know that the code

611
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,070
can't tell you you can go look at other

612
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,410
features but often figure out how do I

613
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,780
get started is really hard so document

614
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,730
how to do things document how to fix

615
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,820
things document where to find things in

616
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,250
your code base and if you can't say what

617
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,530
a directory is for you're doing it wrong

618
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,890
make the directory do less document the

619
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,000
things you wish you didn't have to

620
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,870
document like how to use get in your

621
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,060
suit like how you are using get on this

622
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,590
project how whether you do future

623
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,330
branches in your own repo or whatever

624
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,550
document things like that that maybe

625
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,140
when you were a small team you all just

626
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,180
agreed on with a handshake but now as

627
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,740
your team is growing you need to share

628
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,700
this out treat your code if you have

629
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,220
more than a tiny handful of developers

630
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,290
working on a project like this treat

631
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,610
your code like an open source project

632
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,220
have a change log every week that says

633
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,320
not these are the new features we made

634
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,050
like the new customer facing features we

635
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,090
made but hey I changed how this method

636
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,380
works and you're going to want to know

637
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,050
about that and so have a change on treat

638
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,340
your project like an open source project

639
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,720
so that other developers can know what's

640
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,850
going on just like hopefully they know

641
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,920
what's going on in a in a well

642
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,840
maintained open source project in

643
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,060
finally put it all in the repo at least

644
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,340
to start you know don't put it on your

645
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,290
company wiki that's not where your

646
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,230
developers are working every day I think

647
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,080
that a company wiki is just not a great

648
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,900
place if its documentation about the

649
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,180
code it belongs as close to the code as

650
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:04,120
possible lastly measuring things this

651
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,780
was this is something that's important I

652
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,700
have no idea what the answer is because

653
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,400
how do you measure developer happiness

654
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,440
like you can measure attrition but

655
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,440
that's kind of a terrible way to find

656
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,050
out that you didn't do a good job it's

657
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,850
really hard to quantify the speed of

658
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,710
feature delivery you can't really you

659
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,420
know the feature a is not equivalent to

660
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,010
feature be you can't say Oh feature a

661
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,620
took two weeks and now it only takes one

662
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,180
but it's a different feature it does it

663
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,220
you can't make a good comparison a

664
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,040
couple of things you can do is make sure

665
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,080
that these changes that you're making

666
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,240
aren't making things worse so we keep an

667
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,610
eye on these cyclomatic complexity of

668
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,559
our code and some other complexity

669
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,240
metrics to make sure that we're not

670
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,820
doing anything terrible in this

671
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,610
refactoring that our overall complexity

672
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,440
is either staying the same or going down

673
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,330
and also the complex that this is a

674
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,940
grunt grunt plugin called complexity

675
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,850
report and it's a great way to also kind

676
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,040
of identify oh maybe I should spend some

677
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,990
time looking at that file because it is

678
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,700
reporting that it is less maintainable

679
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,059
or more complex than other files in the

680
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:19,000
in the code base you can also make sure

681
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,690
that you aren't making a performance on

682
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,370
improvements so that's another thing

683
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,900
that we're doing is keeping an eye I

684
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,000
have no idea what this little jag is at

685
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,050
the beginning I kinda need to figure

686
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,840
that out because that's bad but it's

687
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,280
going back down so that's good so you

688
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,250
can you can keep an eye on how your how

689
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,480
these changes are affecting the

690
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,490
performance of your code but probably

691
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,580
the best measurement I have of whether

692
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,980
this is working and whether I'm doing my

693
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,750
job is just listening to the people

694
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,559
around me and listening to what they're

695
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,270
saying and I'm getting a lot of good

696
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,400
feedback about like I wish I had this

697
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,820
you mean I can just do this or you know

698
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,040
those sorts of things hearing success

699
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,470
stories that's that's not a very

700
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,000
objective measurement but it's a nice

701
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,480
one and I think so much of this is just

702
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,330
about listening to people listening to

703
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,920
people when they say nice things and

704
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,179
listening to what they're complaining

705
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:15,610
about and going and fixing it and I

706
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,740
think that even maybe you aren't lucky

707
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,270
enough to have someone who's dedicated

708
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,710
role is this on your team but I'll tell

709
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,630
you what if you nominate yourself to be

710
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,300
that person and just start doing it

711
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,230
you're going to have a new and better

712
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,110
job really soon either the company

713
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,520
you're at or somewhere else who's going

714
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,730
to appreciate this sort of this sort of

715
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,020
thinking about how to make things better

716
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,960
and not just doing your job so are we

717
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,160
there yet is it

718
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,650
done that would be nice cuz I'm about to

719
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,130
disappear for parental leave but I think

720
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,670
that this requires constant vigilance

721
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,170
you can't there's no time when you're

722
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,030
done there's a time when maybe you

723
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,530
aren't spending as much time on these

724
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,930
sorts of things but there's no time when

725
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,270
you're done ensuring that developers can

726
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,780
work with your framework and so that

727
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,330
means doing code reviews reading every

728
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,860
single pull requests and just knowing

729
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,960
what's going on doing the changelog so

730
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,430
that you kind of have a sense of the

731
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,280
churn that's going on eavesdropping on

732
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,020
planning conversations that maybe you

733
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,150
weren't involved in or maybe you don't

734
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,130
strictly need to be involved in but

735
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,570
listening to what's coming down the

736
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,100
pipeline so you can get involved in

737
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,230
conversations about how you can solve

738
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,260
those problems or write those features

739
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,580
so that you aren't creating more

740
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,470
problems down the road yeah that's me
