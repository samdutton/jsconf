00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,120

hi welcome to Berlin evrim and that look

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,530
like an here myself everyone that

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,849
doesn't live here everyone that does I

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,449
see on a most viewed work with you all

5
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:20,730
my name's Ben green and welcome to the

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,920
most deliberately low-tech presentation

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,019
with Jess conf I'm really happy to be

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,779
here I work on a bunch of web projects

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,119
javascript-based and others and not

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,070
talking about those maybe next year if

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,239
they go well I work in Berlin for nokia

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,110
on a great big mapping application and

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,920
i'm not going to be talking about that

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,270
either if you wanted anything about that

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,520
andreas talk tomorrow is going to be

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,770
brilliant take your hangovers and enjoy

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,100
that so and then green but you can call

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,170
me anything you like Sideshow Bob is a

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,170
quite a common one and the title of my

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,300
talk is how to be better it's how to be

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,309
better how to get better and how to

22
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,350
decide how good you want to be how to

23
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,290
argue with jas lint but if anything it's

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,200
a celebration of core JavaScript so a

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,820
little bit peculiar coming straight

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,150
after Sammy's talk about frameworks

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,009
because this isn't frameworks it's

28
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,420
called JavaScript first question then I

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,040
suppose that needs to be answered is is

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,430
what is getting better mean the original

31
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,530
rubric for this talk said that it was

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,479
one mediocre JavaScript developers

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,820
tedious and ongoing attempts to become

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,299
slightly less mediocre that's me the big

35
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,939
shots of JavaScript to hear fortunately

36
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,710
no matter how ur embarrassed and nervous

37
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,509
I am I don't think I can be Brendan

38
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,950
Ike's nervousness and embarrassment this

39
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,110
morning when that a very nice young lady

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,210
sang to him so that's ok be the big

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,979
shots of JavaScript to hear I am NOT a

42
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,540
JavaScript demigod I'm not sitting on a

43
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,880
cloud saying hey I'll give you a hand up

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,189
this is how this is how you get here I'm

45
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,860
struggling to get there just exactly the

46
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,829
same as everybody else the second part

47
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,210
of it i suppose is when did javascript

48
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,190
get hard it is hard

49
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,410
about it there's a lot to learn when I

50
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,260
started on the internet when the

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,670
distinction between the internet and the

52
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,440
world wide web was still important and

53
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,740
relevant the internet at the time was

54
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,390
all particle physics and tributes to

55
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,670
Jerry Garcia if you don't know Jerry

56
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,370
Garcia was to see me after class and

57
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,100
light bulb jokes and Klingon jokes this

58
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,200
is an unsustainable ecosystem as soon as

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,180
the ultimate mashup of the internet

60
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,460
happened which was how many Klingons it

61
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,650
take to change a light bulb that was the

62
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,300
end of that he was doomed and we needed

63
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,550
something else new thing of course came

64
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,220
along thanks Tim was was the world wide

65
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,300
web and things started to get difficult

66
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,750
straight away in the in in the start it

67
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,580
was dead easy everyone wanted to get

68
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,410
their their documents their brochures

69
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,750
they wanted to get the math in in the

70
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,720
electronic space and this was by no

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,580
means programming there was nothing

72
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,140
about this that we would recognize his

73
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,660
programming today but at the time back

74
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,150
then no one could touch type computers

75
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,580
were still sufficiently intimidating for

76
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,820
a profession to grow up out of this then

77
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,480
those are nice folks at Microsoft and

78
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,940
then to invent it away where you could

79
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,040
change already you had free access to

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,160
the SRC property of an image for example

81
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,040
something we could change images and we

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,520
call this D HTML and then the again it

83
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,560
was Microsoft again they invented this

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,600
thing called Ajax and the job boards

85
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,610
went mental with we want people who can

86
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,500
you can speak Ajax so you looked it up

87
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,959
on the world wide web which we now call

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,150
the Internet where this time you looked

89
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,260
up and you found it was to new things

90
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,530
you need to learn one new xhr request

91
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,209
activex component thing and

92
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,940
onreadystatechange look this instead

93
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,580
excellent like into ajax and at this

94
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,980
point things started to get interesting

95
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,010
and we started the game called a mystery

96
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,820
a mastery buzzword bingo d HTML became

97
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,980
ajax ajax became object orientation

98
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,709
object orientation became behavioral

99
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,959
driven development don't know what the

100
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,160
next big thing is that we're going to

101
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,560
have to do is BDDs already about six

102
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,289
months old so in internet time table 2

103
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:18,540
certainly a little bit

104
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,130
but it's fear it's the paper scissors

105
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,690
rock Spock of JavaScript mastery bdd

106
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,479
beat 00 beat say Jack say Jack sweets

107
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,860
DHL DHL beats flash I supposed and the

108
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,910
it's about halfway through this list

109
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,889
some moved in a Jets an object object

110
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:40,479
orientation but things got interesting

111
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,430
and when it got interesting then we

112
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,870
could do more with it and when we start

113
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,930
being able to do more with it it

114
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,330
attracted a better a better caliber of

115
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,280
developer and better developers come in

116
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,750
why don't I do make it more difficult

117
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,630
for the rest of us the more difficult it

118
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,400
gets the better quality developers it

119
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,710
attracts the more the pay goes up I mean

120
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,780
it keeps getting harder and harder but

121
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,910
the great thing is all of this stuff was

122
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,060
there in in the in the original spectral

123
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,889
earring Douglas Crockford invented

124
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,380
invented Jason but it was already there

125
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,720
it was it was already part of JavaScript

126
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,479
I mean obviously harmony is going to do

127
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,830
great things about this and it's going

128
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,410
to it's going to make it all it's going

129
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,610
to throw away the rulebook an agency

130
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,960
it's going to come to a real proper

131
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,330
stuff so the question is if Java scripts

132
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,160
getting harder or subtracting better

133
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,080
developers and what are you going to do

134
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,169
about it and the original rubric I wrote

135
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,750
for this talk the one that thanks guys

136
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,520
got me the talk in the first place I'm

137
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,919
said something along the lines of you've

138
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,900
ripped yeah I'm missing a slide I'm very

139
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,620
gay just keep talking to each other okay

140
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,030
I'm missing a slide actually it looks

141
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,970
like that hey you can't say hey probably

142
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,289
probably turn up somewhere a little bit

143
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,690
later on in the image I this is low tech

144
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,050
as I said and the original the original

145
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,940
description of this talk said okay so

146
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,889
you've read the definitive guide you

147
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,539
flick through Dec my standard and you've

148
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,520
joined your local user group what are

149
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,169
you going to do now how do you take the

150
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,419
next step I spoke to a bunch of friends

151
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,460
of mine JavaScript developers of a love

152
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,560
and respect and think great things off

153
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,720
it turned out that none of them had read

154
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,460
the definitive guide and very few of

155
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,400
them a flick through the standard and

156
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,550
none

157
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,280
join local user group so I wish this was

158
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,930
on the on the on the screen HD cuz it's

159
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,430
a good one it's got takes this is this

160
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,900
is what I say is that the first step

161
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,160
this is this not what I want to talk

162
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,540
about today these are the first step so

163
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,460
going back in and look at these things

164
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,720
and of course it doesn't have to be the

165
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,550
definitive guide and the guy downstairs

166
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,410
talking in a minute is written in one of

167
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,050
the very greatest books on JavaScript

168
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,400
there is in my opinion and I don't know

169
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,480
why you're not all down there he's

170
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,880
wonderful you don't need to read easy ma

171
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,500
standard of course you can read Dimitri

172
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,210
shot and coughs explanation of it which

173
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,340
is just like the easy ma standard but

174
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,740
it's explained and it's got its got

175
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,720
getting a mission much much far fewer

176
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,270
square brackets in it which certainly

177
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,310
play with my head and you don't need to

178
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,380
join your JavaScript local user group

179
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,270
join a user group where you can talk to

180
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,030
other developers about coding about

181
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,520
writing stuff the things I want to talk

182
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,010
about today so just to go back and those

183
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,390
three things at the start they're not

184
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,400
the path the path I want to talk that

185
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,590
has these three strands on it our

186
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,190
purpose autonomy and mastery the talks

187
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,310
how to get better clearly we're at James

188
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,690
Caan forget me talking like JavaScript

189
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,560
we're going to be using javascript

190
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,630
examples but it's about getting better

191
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,280
this might not be the best talk here but

192
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,780
it's the only one that tells you it's

193
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,130
going to make you happier and healthier

194
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,300
and better person very good first often

195
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,920
the purpose what is the purpose of what

196
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,370
we're doing first up purpose is the

197
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,170
product that you're working on do you

198
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,850
love the product I'm lucky and working

199
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,210
for a team that really really gets me

200
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,370
gets me quite excited as a nine-year-old

201
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,260
kid the only thing that I thought was

202
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,850
really important in the world was maps

203
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,530
those are the maps and computers and

204
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,150
make care of the work down the chip shop

205
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,180
put them never got anywhere with a one

206
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,270
out of three of those so maps and

207
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,430
sausage million-match aspect and none of

208
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,130
us are feeding the world or curing it

209
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,230
evades unless any of you are in which

210
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,090
case comes me I'll give you a donation

211
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,970
afterwards good work but that doesn't

212
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,380
mean we can't engage with the products

213
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,840
that we're creating me I'm working on

214
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,390
maps Nokia Maps as I'm going to make a

215
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,430
big song and dance about it but the

216
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,510
purpose for the product

217
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,590
there are more important things in the

218
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,650
world and maps but I really love it

219
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,040
number two in purpose is your users your

220
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,060
personal experience on this one of

221
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,310
course of in freelancing for many years

222
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,350
now and working full time with the

223
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,550
product that I'm currently working on

224
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,800
it's in beta we don't have any users and

225
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,300
we have be two testers but you can't

226
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,970
trust them because they're all fanboys

227
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,000
which takes us on to the some familiar

228
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,530
not be nice about it either but there we

229
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,040
go which takes us onto the team the

230
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,440
question about the team is possibly the

231
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,690
one that's hardest to address and you

232
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,070
have to get on with your colleagues and

233
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,770
clearly if you don't then do something

234
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,860
about it if you're alone JavaScript

235
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,320
developer you're probably not going to

236
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,910
get any better it's going to be really

237
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,530
difficult for you try and get yourself

238
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,120
into a team clearly if you are Elaine

239
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,620
JavaScript developer if you're a jobbing

240
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,640
freelance and you're having fun

241
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,770
absolutely fantastic there are plenty of

242
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,990
talks at this conference that will help

243
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,280
you with your jobs in your day-to-day

244
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,620
work this talk is that how to get better

245
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,720
and it did say that you need to decide

246
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,510
how much you really want to do the

247
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,370
question that's relevant with your team

248
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,860
though about you getting better is are

249
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,390
you the best JavaScript developer on the

250
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,150
team if the answer's hell no that's fine

251
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,600
if you want is absolutely yes then it

252
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,370
probably isn't the important answer is

253
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,700
long ago yeah well not quite sure and if

254
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,860
you're in this position then you're not

255
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,290
going to learn as much from your team as

256
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,720
someone who's more junior so you now

257
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,750
have to you have to find out something

258
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,220
else to do so if you love your products

259
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,230
and you love helping your users but you

260
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,660
sort of may be top dog in your team it's

261
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,340
about time to start giving swing back

262
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,890
you got to mentor the juniors you got to

263
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,110
teach the world start a blog why not

264
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,370
there are loads of good blogs out there

265
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,260
but there's always room for another one

266
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,810
there's always a new angle and or you

267
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,940
can quit I've done it I've quit more

268
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,380
jobs than that I've had hot milk you

269
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,300
learn quickly as a freelancer jump

270
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,710
between jobs you will learn stuff from

271
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,420
people because you're meeting awful lot

272
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,740
of people you'll get exposed to a lot of

273
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,660
stuff it won't all be good you'll see

274
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,920
stuff that you go oh my god that's

275
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,170
terrible I did that last week and

276
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,400
you'll stop doing it you can learn from

277
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,610
negatives as well as positive and

278
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,640
but for my money the best way to learn

279
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,779
once you're getting good when she coming

280
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,670
somewhere close to mastery is long-term

281
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,220
development on full on multiple life

282
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,190
cycles of the product let's look at the

283
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,260
next one in purpose autonomy and

284
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,360
mastering mastery this is probably the

285
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,660
one that's sort of most interesting and

286
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,010
when I spoke to the organizers they said

287
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,029
I hope you're going to show us lots of

288
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:11,250
tricks and great little things that will

289
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,600
make you a better JavaScript development

290
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,430
i said course I am and there aren't any

291
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,079
it's as simple as that there's nothing I

292
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,480
can say do this and you will be a better

293
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,220
JavaScript developer understand

294
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,930
JavaScript you'll be about a JavaScript

295
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,730
developer but there's nothing I can say

296
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,990
there's nothing I can give you to take

297
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,880
away that if you start doing you'll get

298
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,180
better however we can say some stuff

299
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,690
what's mastery there is a definition of

300
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,670
mastery in a dictionary can't run which

301
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,579
one it was the ability of power to use

302
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,130
control or dispose of something so we

303
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,899
all use JavaScript this is good we're

304
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,000
all here because we use JavaScript but

305
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,300
do we control it or does it control us

306
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,370
control is deliberate and careful

307
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,100
construction really glad to see Sam eat

308
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,690
on that construction we're constructing

309
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,300
stuff are we constructing JavaScript or

310
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,250
are we checking it all together in in a

311
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,649
pile like a rubbish bin outside the

312
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,260
restaurant are we making it go beyond

313
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,180
what it what we think it can do what we

314
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,990
think they can naturally natively do to

315
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,240
dispose to dispose of something the

316
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,370
meaning of disposes to throw away is a

317
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,630
fairly modern meaning really what it

318
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,620
generally means what what it's always

319
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,480
used to mean was to deal with finally

320
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,880
and conclusively so to achieve mastery

321
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,190
in something is to use something

322
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,010
deliberately and conclusively are we

323
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,540
using our JavaScript like this an

324
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,870
example maybe is the best JavaScript

325
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,490
developers I know right the best unit

326
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,260
tests okay we don't need to open a

327
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,880
conversation on unit tests we all right

328
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,750
then we walk one hundred percent

329
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,730
coverage we all run them for every

330
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,930
commit go sweetie especially me they're

331
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,339
our team members of mine here they're

332
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,899
the ones laughing hardest I think I can

333
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,560
feel it and

334
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,850
the best JavaScript Phillips I know

335
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,620
right best unit tests this isn't an

336
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,240
accident it's because they're writing

337
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,370
tests which there aren't a code excuse

338
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,990
me which they control which they

339
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,370
natively understand there's nothing

340
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,320
strange about it there's a famous

341
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,300
golfing quote that's variously

342
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,040
attributed to arnold palmer and gary

343
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,390
player but it was an actual fact neither

344
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,420
of these after shooting extremely long

345
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,630
and difficult part on the 17th green no

346
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,529
error and syncing it some some wise

347
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,140
commentator said you know Arnold Oh Gary

348
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,970
or whoever it was you're really lucky

349
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,670
the answer was I know it's amazing and

350
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,140
the more I practice the luckier I get

351
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,690
it's the same with writing unit tests if

352
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,089
you're in control of your code your

353
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,850
tests will be easier it's a good it's a

354
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,380
good mark of if you're if you're winning

355
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,760
if your unit tests are getting easier to

356
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,040
liberals inconclusive means there are no

357
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,460
wtf's in JavaScript here's my favorite

358
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,410
one okay I'm sure you've all seen it

359
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,480
it's so it's not completely unheard of

360
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,000
its it's not particularly new it does

361
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,290
matter it's still my favorite even

362
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,990
though it's old I have two expressions

363
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,510
the first one has an empty array

364
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,250
equivalent false the second one has not

365
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,070
an empty array equivalent false

366
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,300
presumably only one of these expressions

367
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,550
can possibly evaluate to true the other

368
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,680
one must be false question announcers

369
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,060
are boring I'm not gonna not going to

370
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,520
say your hands up or anything but these

371
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,680
want the folks here encapsulate pretty

372
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,930
much all JavaScript WTF so at least all

373
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,780
the easy ones foxy values type coercion

374
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,390
and operator precedence they're both

375
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,650
true the first one is simply a statement

376
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,260
of fact the foxy values in javascript

377
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,390
need to know them do we all know them

378
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,339
faulty values and Java scripts are right

379
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,440
there if you have an empty array it

380
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,010
equates default however the truthiness

381
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,930
of an empty array you stick a stick of

382
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,790
bank before it and you no longer looking

383
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,050
at the mt array you're looking at the

384
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,940
truthiness of an empty array eraser

385
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,620
objects objects are always truthfully

386
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,150
objects aren't in that list so the

387
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,890
truthiness of an empty object of an

388
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,040
empty array negated false both of those

389
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,440
statements are true and when i first

390
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,870
started designing this talk i thought

391
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,520
about starting with foxy values and then

392
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,139
the phone

393
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,019
sizing and and we're all way beyond that

394
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,109
and then a couple of days later and I

395
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,939
genuinely do work with some of the best

396
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,470
JavaScript developers I've ever met I

397
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,350
found a wrong falsely value someone had

398
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,029
got something on so learn the small

399
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:16,859
stuff first I know you all know this you

400
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:18,449
all know there are six foxy values not

401
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:20,910
five and not seven in you can you can

402
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,009
you can read all them all off on the top

403
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:25,049
of your head off the top of your head

404
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,119
but first thing is learn the easy stuff

405
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,220
secondly it's learned more difficult

406
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,169
stuff again this is patronizing leeez

407
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:34,350
I'm not attempting to show anyone

408
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,779
anything new here two ways of making an

409
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,399
array one is using new word over the

410
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,869
array constructor and the second one is

411
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:42,540
the the literal construction of it okay

412
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,579
my suggestion isn't that this is really

413
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,679
new and exciting it's just a nice card

414
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,269
to show what I actually want to say

415
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:50,759
which is there a 21 native methods of

416
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,730
arrays his little game for you to play

417
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,309
afterwards mix up with pairs or threes

418
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:58,619
or fours sperling it's swinging when

419
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:00,720
none of us might after the talk grant

420
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,929
paper and a pencil and see if you can

421
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,660
write down all of the 21 native arrays

422
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,669
native methods of a raise my betting is

423
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,079
very few of us would be able to do it

424
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,910
I'll give you a clue there are seven

425
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,040
mutators seven excesses and say seven

426
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,259
iterators but you know if you don't know

427
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,169
this stuff and you're not was that so

428
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:20,790
that's what someone's directing me which

429
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,699
is entirely possible i love accumulating

430
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,319
these i'm a twitcher a twitter in

431
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,110
english is a birdwatcher I almost keep a

432
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,519
little book by the cert of my desk and

433
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,319
every time I use a new array method I

434
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,939
noted down with the date and feel

435
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:35,759
extremely proud of myself this one I

436
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,649
don't actually clearly there'd be far

437
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:39,899
too nerdy and I got to use a raise some

438
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,910
for the first time this week and that

439
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,679
made me extremely happy then there's one

440
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,319
of your iterators by the way that's som

441
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,769
e honest lee seun doesn't exist if it

442
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:51,720
did i guess you'd use array reduce

443
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,679
there's another one there's two

444
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,169
iterators some and reduce just fine for

445
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:59,399
those together and so when your erase

446
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,799
learn your foxy 840 values start simple

447
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,079
around 40 values we build up strings are

448
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,760
easy there's not so much to learn about

449
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,949
those coercion but stringz usually win

450
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:10,439
that race learn objects learn how to

451
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,590
tell a raisin objects part

452
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,730
something that was in my talk earlier

453
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,310
but speaking to Morgan sitting at the

454
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,440
front a friend of mine and named quite a

455
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,840
velocity something that came up there

456
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,160
just this morning was know the

457
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,800
difference between global variables and

458
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,300
properties of the window object they

459
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,830
look exactly the same but they're not

460
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,580
these are the things that mastery

461
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,350
requires and power it requires power and

462
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,700
mastery and so there are two more things

463
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,410
aren't say about JavaScript I've got no

464
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,750
idea how I'm doing for time I'm probably

465
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,820
speaking Farsi fast and nearly finished

466
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,340
the first thing I want to say I musingly

467
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,100
coming straight after also learn css3

468
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,710
transitions there's the slide won't help

469
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,060
you with your JavaScript but it'll make

470
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,380
you a better developer I promise you

471
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,750
learn them they're really awesome but

472
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,090
let's flip over them and it'll mean you

473
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,740
lose use a lot less jQuery helpers then

474
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,600
we are allowed to use things to help us

475
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,150
to learn core java script this is fine

476
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,660
I'm not too too harsh on this one he

477
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,330
says help is part one then his

478
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,550
frameworks and we've just seen fantastic

479
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,220
fantastic talk about frameworks by a guy

480
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,510
who knows an awful lot more about in

481
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,940
than ID our frameworks are good faint

482
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,340
frameworks fill the holes in JavaScript

483
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,930
implementations and browses the shins

484
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,420
and they even out accesses to things

485
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,730
that are difficult it's ridiculous that

486
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,250
the event model is still kind of hard to

487
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,500
get to and not completely constant

488
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,570
across all browsers it helps us with

489
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,720
repetitive tasks helps us do stuff that

490
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,390
we would find difficult to do otherwise

491
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,760
my question is why they say damn big and

492
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,520
why do they do so much stuff um there's

493
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,040
a whole bunch of them and clearly know

494
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,440
some of them some of them you don't for

495
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,050
example those ones as the ones i wrote

496
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,940
you never heard them because i never

497
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,410
released them if you if you need the

498
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,120
shins and you're traveling from job to

499
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,650
job let's get rid of those because

500
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,200
you'll just focus on them I used to

501
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,820
carry these things around on a floppy

502
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,530
disk which became a CD which became a

503
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,780
pen drive which broke and I've got a

504
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,910
backup somewhere I'm sure you carry

505
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,410
around the functions that you really

506
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,769
need

507
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,459
all of a sudden you put the frame that

508
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,619
you put functions you really need on a

509
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:27,700
floppy disk and you've got yourself

510
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,599
framework one impeachment one beseech

511
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,539
Minh please do not put them on get there

512
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,369
are enough there already use them to

513
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:38,589
Sammy said use them to fix the problems

514
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:41,109
in your application in other words write

515
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:43,929
them for your application no doubt about

516
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:45,879
it you will code faster using a

517
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:47,499
framework you will knock stuff out more

518
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,509
quickly but I'm not interested in what

519
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:51,309
your freelancer day rate is I'm

520
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:53,229
interested in making us better call

521
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:55,719
javascript developers and one word is if

522
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,849
you use a framework even when the

523
00:19:57,849 --> 00:19:59,799
awesome ones i read you will not become

524
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,229
a better called JavaScript developer i

525
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:05,139
also have an interlude very nice a

526
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:06,940
couple of things about helpers this is a

527
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,379
help as interlude we're on the subject

528
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:10,629
of both get and helpers here are some

529
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,549
things to consider as a JavaScript

530
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:15,609
developer using vile vin drinking energy

531
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:18,129
drinks using now using get all of these

532
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:19,629
will make you a better call javascript

533
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:21,669
developer in exactly the same way that

534
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,169
riding a fixie makes you a better

535
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:25,389
JavaScript developer I don't care what

536
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:27,459
ide what takes 30 to use I don't care

537
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,159
what you drink club parties disgusting

538
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,649
whatever I don't care if you're on git

539
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,329
or svn or if you're on sneaker sneaker

540
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:41,679
whatever it is it doesn't matter it's a

541
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,700
it's what you do and not particularly

542
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,979
the tools you use to have you there I

543
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:50,589
told you use to do it I'm we spring this

544
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:53,440
on to help us part 2 as I'd like a

545
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,209
Bering a lot of fist fight after this we

546
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,889
better move away from the get in the air

547
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,979
and the the club Marty conversation and

548
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:01,989
move swiftly on help us part 2 could

549
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:04,479
also be called coffeescript vs jayus

550
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:10,149
lind best way to look at these are

551
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,829
spaced best introduction is to look at

552
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:13,539
some quotes best quote I over heard

553
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,070
about coffee script was actually from a

554
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,619
boss of mine is that everyone gets bored

555
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:20,109
of writing braces sooner or later and if

556
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,029
you're using it on coding on a german

557
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:23,499
keyboard you're going to get bored of

558
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:25,509
them even sooner it's a real finger

559
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:29,229
that anyway this quote I honestly don't

560
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:29,990
remember who is

561
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,520
there was from one of the gods in es

562
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,110
discuss it might be market smell it

563
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,500
might have been half an hour ago I knew

564
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,850
the other person it might have been the

565
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,840
better JavaScript rewrite excuse me the

566
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,780
better your coffee script will be seized

567
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,480
me dry up the better JavaScript you

568
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,559
write the better your Papa script will

569
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,840
be coffee script doesn't improve your

570
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,490
JavaScript it writes your JavaScript for

571
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,850
you it's sugar it makes things easier if

572
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,800
we're attempting to be on the path to

573
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,300
perfection the path of mastery the path

574
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,340
of getting better if you're committed to

575
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,350
this road of improvement you do not want

576
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,700
to be making things easier for yourself

577
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,559
you want to me making them more

578
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,500
difficult for yourself improvement comes

579
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,809
from overcoming hurdles from bettering

580
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,460
your knowledge not from bypassing them

581
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,240
and taking shortcuts j/s link will hurt

582
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,309
your feelings it's the only quote about

583
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,929
Jazlyn that really matters it's from

584
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:26,179
Crockford himself everybody knows it by

585
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,820
gun does James Lind hurt my feelings it

586
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,309
puts boulders in my path but then sort

587
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,120
of that sort of boulders that I like but

588
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,400
my rules for Jay Iceland you can only

589
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,800
stop using it when you can effectively

590
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,170
argue with it I've seen some arguments

591
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,570
against Jazlyn that I do not understand

592
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,340
at all if I don't understand those

593
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,250
arguments then I don't feel that I'm

594
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,280
that I'm allowed to use them well you

595
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,770
can do those you can look at the options

596
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,240
one bar with white reg 81 violent forces

597
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,100
hoisting stick variable at the top with

598
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,260
says we're not allowed to use it whiting

599
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,470
forces whitespace rules and regs kills

600
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,309
records basically that's southern bottom

601
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,240
you don't have to be able to argue with

602
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,470
the whole of jazz Lind but you can only

603
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,330
start turning options off when you can

604
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,970
argue with those options reg ex really

605
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,950
easy to argue with the rules for reg ex

606
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,350
ganja in jail in break almonds

607
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,870
nationalization

608
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,860
personally I've fair dealing in

609
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,040
internationalized stuff can I turn that

610
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,030
off nice and easy white space does an

611
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,740
argument that says code consistency is

612
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,990
good there's an argument that says why

613
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,400
are you telling me to use white space

614
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,260
it's a little bit trickier to argue it

615
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,110
with for example and the guy currently

616
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,350
talking downstairs won the JavaScript 1k

617
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,180
competition this year I don't have seen

618
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,490
this little canvas jumpy gaming house it

619
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,110
fantastic crack open the code have a

620
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,910
look at it it's amazing it relies

621
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,270
extremely heavily on with other than

622
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,280
that with is generally dangerous it's

623
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,290
generally bad if your code is good

624
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,060
enough to win the JavaScript 1k

625
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,240
competition don't use with other than

626
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,060
that it's probably considered bad 1-var

627
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,100
if anyone can find an argument for not

628
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,190
doing this buy me a drink now by your

629
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,780
jigger and buy you out by your case of

630
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,610
drinks there's nothing you can argue it

631
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,860
about one where at all so James min term

632
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:24,000
bits off a my mind I again turn bits off

633
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,020
hey when you can argue convincingly with

634
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,690
them which leads us to a graph this is

635
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,610
the graph of J's link vs coffeescript

636
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,340
usage percentage you're allowed to use

637
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,850
them plotted against your own personal

638
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,490
JavaScript skills ors CoffeeScript makes

639
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,140
things easy jobs could make things hard

640
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,940
as you get better you can start using

641
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,460
one more than the other

642
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,179
then we'll note on that javascript makes

643
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,980
you think CoffeeScript makes you fast

644
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,309
we're good if you need to think then you

645
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:59,280
shouldn't be speeding up so we called

646
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,440
tell me alone when I'm good if you need

647
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,700
to think you don't need to be speeding

648
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,980
up coffeescript is not a shortcut to

649
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,630
mastery it's not a short cuts getting

650
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,700
better it's the reward you get at the

651
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,370
end for being that damn good it's the

652
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,440
Karate Kid apprenticeship comes before

653
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,720
mastery if you can't wax on wax off

654
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,520
you're not allowed in the ring couple

655
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,169
more things to say not very much nearly

656
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:23,250
there at the end probably a bit too

657
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,220
early being speaking too fast one of the

658
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,510
most important things and Sammy touched

659
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,870
on this as well is the styles change

660
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,850
about a year ago dis looked horrendous

661
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,470
this looked terrible to everyone that

662
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,030
saw it I still know some people who

663
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,710
argue with it I think it's really cute

664
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,299
and really neat and it's not new and

665
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:43,850
we've all seen it yeah assignment by

666
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,289
what is it son by some sort of boolean

667
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:47,789
check first I think that's absolutely

668
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:53,100
fantastic be prepared for be prepared

669
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,900
for styles changing and adapt your stars

670
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,520
to them be aware of when they're

671
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,559
changing as well this one here's a

672
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,840
little more controversial maybe if you

673
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,640
go to google and you type in javascript

674
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,400
assignment in conditional you get 15

675
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,559
pages of java developers saying this is

676
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,780
so bad don't do it don't do it again i

677
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,340
disagree i think this is this is really

678
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,260
quite elegant and it saves a line and i

679
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,030
think it's a thing it's gonna start

680
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,360
getting used an awful lot more last

681
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,520
thing on mastery and I was gonna say

682
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,250
quite a bit about garbage collection and

683
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,679
making things faster but I think a lot

684
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,539
of you were just downstairs and most of

685
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:28,470
what I was going to say I was going to

686
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,049
Nick from his talk so if you've seen all

687
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,299
that there's no point be going over it

688
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,610
and Sony we're going to skip everyone

689
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,740
and pretend that wasn't there there was

690
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,120
a mistake in it several mistakes in it

691
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,070
high-end mastery then we've done the

692
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,690
easy stuff done false values done

693
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,830
strings with an object's have done

694
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,770
window objects we know all the methods

695
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,460
of all the natives high-end mastery then

696
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,880
is about garbage collection if you've

697
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,169
mastering if you're mastering the

698
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:00,850
intermediate then move on to the

699
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,820
the real hard stuff the only thing I

700
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,810
really want to say about garbage

701
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,680
collection is objects are not data dumps

702
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,260
the most I remember one step forward

703
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,930
that I took was when I was passing a

704
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,910
single parameter into a function and

705
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,920
suddenly I needed to pass too and as I

706
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,540
crap how am I gonna do this because I

707
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,740
really couldn't modify anything in the

708
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,290
code and guy sitting next to me I was

709
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,270
much younger obviously guy sitting next

710
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,250
to me they passed an object in I thought

711
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,260
this is actually fantastic you got two

712
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,050
parameters for the price of one really

713
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,540
really useful these days they my opinion

714
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,520
is that you should never ever use an

715
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,050
object as a data dump never just keep

716
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,820
willfully extending an object it's

717
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,280
really really bad the key word is keep

718
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,620
your object shaped object shapes the

719
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,300
same and I'm afraid I don't have a card

720
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,580
for this but if two objects have exactly

721
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,770
the same structure then as you'll have

722
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,420
heard from downstairs I expect you

723
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,760
mentioned it the comparisons getting

724
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,990
something like absolutely blindingly

725
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,020
fast so tidy up your objects for me this

726
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,580
is the one that I'm at at the minute and

727
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,950
I still extend objects absolutely

728
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,260
willy-nilly I spoke to a colleague of

729
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,810
mine about this and he said yeah it's

730
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,400
dead easy always use constructors for

731
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,340
objects great advice it's long that I'm

732
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,040
going to be trying to go for our next to

733
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,890
the final thing then in achieving

734
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,800
greatness is autonomy autonomy is what

735
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,870
happens when you have enough space and

736
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,450
enough time to think about stuff the

737
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,820
fable urban myth by Brendan rising j/s

738
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,320
in 10 days it wasn't that he sat down a

739
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,060
rated in 10 days it's that he was given

740
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,100
10 days of free time in which to write

741
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,890
it a 10 days of free time is not a whole

742
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,290
lot but these 10 clear days without any

743
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,030
molestation when he could bring together

744
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,650
everything he knew about Netscape and

745
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,020
small talk and hyper card and all the

746
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,370
other things in you and he was allowed

747
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,890
this creative splurge and if in your

748
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,380
workplace you are not given free time to

749
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,290
do some of your own stuff I'd change it

750
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,940
I mean change it is actually relatively

751
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,920
straightforward getting there get

752
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,480
yourself research days and research

753
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,690
weeks if you're really lucky allow slack

754
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,390
in your in your agile planning because

755
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,100
we're all doing our job clearly allows

756
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,840
slacking you're planning to do extra

757
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,460
stuff just to sit and think if that's

758
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,770
all it takes and you need space and

759
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,080
time and privacy I supposed to combine

760
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,640
new ideas and autonomy leads to

761
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,400
inspiration inspiration is ideas having

762
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,940
sex inspiration leads to genius genius I

763
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,000
told you don't say that and so talk

764
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,040
about purpose how to get greater

765
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,510
JavaScript need purpose you need to

766
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,980
understand your product and you use as a

767
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,660
new team and you need to know that

768
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,900
they're all working for you mastery do

769
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,880
the easy stuff first don't assume you

770
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,170
know all the easy stuff because you

771
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,150
probably don't the intermediate stuff

772
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,490
has anyone come up with the 21 array

773
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,130
methods yet let me know first onto it

774
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,570
i'll buy them a beer as well issouf on a

775
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,970
beer and the stuff you don't know the

776
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,340
real difficult stuff go over there as

777
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,980
well autonomy allow yourself the room to

778
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,780
breathe and room to think be the author

779
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,490
of your own ambition decide how far you

780
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,320
want to take it and most importantly

781
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,660
keep it to yourself don't tell everyone

782
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,400
what your ambition is they won't help

783
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,380
you necessarily with it thank you very

784
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,820
much that's the end apart from the

785
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,800
course the final slide I know there's

786
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,030
only one reason you've stayed at the end

787
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,770
you want to know how many Klingons it

788
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,360
takes to change a light bulb well the

789
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,070
answer is Klingons are not afraid of the
