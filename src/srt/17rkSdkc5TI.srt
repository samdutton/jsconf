1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,380

I wanted to address a couple things I

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,049
very rarely get to speak and I

3
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:13,889
unfortunately always get put at the last

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,320
slot at this conference so before I

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,730
actually got into my talk I wanted to

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,699
address a couple things in our community

7
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,920
last year I gave talk at this point that

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,930
we need to change our community so I

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,240
wanted to take this chance before my

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,980
actual talk to address some of the

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,750
issues that I'm sure we all have

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,430
questions about I'm sure we were all

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,320
hoping that Eric or Brendan would

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,260
mention certain words that they didn't

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,700
so I want to I want to just talk about

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,410
those real quick the first one would be

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,870
the obvious elephant in the room from a

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,110
leaked email with pure speculation and

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,829
that being dark dark is awesome I think

20
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,090
we as developers has javascript

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,710
developers as web developers should

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,469
embrace dart and I'm not saying give up

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,940
ever give up JavaScript and just go

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,620
running to dart land because we don't

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,359
even know what dart land is everything

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,800
we've heard about at this point is pure

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,610
speculation the web is a massive place

28
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,600
historically speaking if you look at the

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,850
track records the only thing that has

30
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,560
happened when new languages crop off is

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,650
that JavaScript gets better so don't go

32
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,350
spreading negativity about Dart don't

33
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,420
even worry about it until you actually

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,299
know what it is speculation doesn't help

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,030
anything fighting over speculation helps

36
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,520
even less so what I have to say about

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,799
dart is cool let's see what it looks

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,530
like if it's great and we all embrace it

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,729
then it's great because we all embrace

40
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,280
it if it's not great and it ends up not

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,110
working well we'll just merge it in like

42
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,729
we did tamarin and everything will be

43
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,009
great and will all move on so let's not

44
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,390
get all wrapped around the axle on

45
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,940
speculation

46
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,260
did you learn if you want to take away

47
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,930
to let you sleep better at night is Tom

48
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,050
Robinson here where did he go drinking

49
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,830
already ah there Tom had a wonderful

50
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,850
accidental quote is what i'll call it

51
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,130
tom has experienced we don't know him he

52
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,810
helped right he helped all fair

53
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,210
objective j which is a language on top

54
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,540
of javascript and his quote was it is a

55
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,390
lot to ask of people to learn and to use

56
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,300
a whole new language that's a pretty

57
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,190
interesting thing when you think about

58
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,300
it even though we all learn new

59
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,640
languages it is a lot to ask so bear

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,380
that in mind with dart let's see what

61
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,540
the world has to offer i encourage us to

62
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,120
embrace new languages mozilla has rust

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
they're doing amazing things google has

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,980
possibly dark dashed it's something

65
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,830
beginning of d so let's not be afraid of

66
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,540
these new languages let's embrace them

67
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,490
let's see what they have to offer and as

68
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,590
JavaScript developers let's see what

69
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,270
they can do to benefit our language and

70
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,390
make our lives better and that leads me

71
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,209
to my next topic the open web I have a

72
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:53,000
unique position I get to hang out with

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,980
alex russell and brendan eich and have

74
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,310
dinner with some crazy people it's a

75
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,840
unique position for me because I'm not a

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,000
browser vendor I actually don't really

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,130
have much stake in this game I'm a

78
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,830
start-up founder who helps nursing homes

79
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,140
and assisted living which probably some

80
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,920
people in this room that my the benefit

81
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,540
i have is that I get to look at this web

82
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,970
this magical place what all of you are

83
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,320
doing and say wow the battling the not

84
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,750
battling the the energy the excitement

85
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,970
the creativity the innovation the

86
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,640
invention is going on in our space is so

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,070
incredibly amazing when we started in

88
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,190
2009 the world was a lot different place

89
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,560
and it's because we live in an open web

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,690
these days where there isn't a monarchy

91
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,820
instilled and there are multiple

92
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,380
browsers and there are people pushing

93
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,270
the fold and we are doing crazy things

94
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,620
that sometimes seem counterproductive

95
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,400
but in the end this is the web this is

96
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,020
the magic that we all came to this for

97
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:59,559
so hooray open web

98
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,989
which goes to my next talk or next quick

99
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,620
button item promote jas last year we

100
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,840
launched that here and we've done an

101
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,549
amazing job if you haven't looked at our

102
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,260
we first yet we have managed to get

103
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,510
every single search term we were

104
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,310
targeting on the first page of a google

105
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,590
search index that's pretty frickin

106
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,509
impressive but as christian how am I

107
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,250
mentioned that's not nearly enough how

108
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,660
many of you participated in the docs

109
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,810
print that was going on this weekend

110
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,960
that's embarrassing okay I want everyone

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,360
as a mission for as much as you want to

112
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,860
go drinking tonight the cost for

113
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,570
drinking tonight is going on to the mdn

114
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,120
and modifying a doc doesn't have to be

115
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,699
that much just try it break into it

116
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,580
enjoy it go for it it's a shared

117
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,860
document repository it's a wiki anyone

118
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,289
go into it you can add stuff about about

119
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:53,210
Google specific components you can add

120
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,860
stuff about Microsoft specific

121
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,449
components you can add stuff about opera

122
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,160
specific components and of course was a

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,389
little bit like if you added stuff about

124
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,780
mdn or mozilla as well so use this let

125
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,340
this be our center point let this be a

126
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,930
place where we can all come together and

127
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,930
we can all agree on documentation the

128
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,150
next piece is something that I really

129
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,550
want to inspire everyone here when you

130
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,530
leave this place let this not be a

131
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,539
single point in time let this be

132
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,370
something that has changed you let the

133
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,349
presentations today is something that

134
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:23,300
you carry and inspires you and that you

135
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,949
bring back to your local communities

136
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,979
after the last 2 3gs comps that we've

137
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,680
done in each continent at this point

138
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,990
it's been amazing to see the explosion

139
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,970
of different local user groups and

140
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,620
meetups that have popped up and that is

141
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,620
wonderful how many of you out there run

142
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,630
or attend a local meetup a big round of

143
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:52,529
applause to all of you

144
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,009
another cool thing in a cool statistic

145
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:57,259
is this weekend we've been able to

146
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,539
introduce or really push the boundaries

147
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,159
of JavaScript to over a thousand people

148
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:03,530
we have a group assembled here there's a

149
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,220
jquery conf going on in ballston want to

150
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,840
say it's either Boston or San Francisco

151
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,610
and that's a lot of people that are

152
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,169
using javascript and coming to

153
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:15,409
conferences that's very impressive so we

154
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,000
need something to really brandish

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,909
ourselves and we we've been subversive a

156
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:20,840
little bit we've been giving out

157
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,280
stickers and doing these sorts of things

158
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,680
and JavaScript's never had an identity

159
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,810
we had a rhino for a little bit but that

160
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,610
doesn't really seem so good right now

161
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,560
that we're kicking tail and being really

162
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,650
fast so you know what you may hate this

163
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,440
logo and that's cool but I'm gonna say

164
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,690
let's just use it it's simple it works

165
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,639
it doesn't really appeal to any browser

166
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:47,150
vendor it's awesome it's our logo it's

167
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,979
only other laptops already and we're

168
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:52,400
honest cell phones so i'm making this

169
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,150
fully publicly available in raw format

170
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,240
HTTP colon slash slash jazz conf calm /

171
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,630
jst PS if you want to use it great if

172
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,330
you don't great it's up to you we'll

173
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,240
call it a community logo or not it's

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,620
just an offer and that's my offer so I'm

175
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,880

yeah exactly I don't get to speak very

196
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,970
much in fact the last time I actually

197
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,290
spoke was in Berlin at JS con for you

198
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,110
it's a unique position to be conference

199
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,580
organizer and not be able to ever really

200
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,770
talk so when I do get a chance to speak

201
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,390
i'm gonna talk about things i want to

202
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,850
talk to you directly about the issues

203
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,320
and problems that I see with our

204
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,120
community if you hate those kind of

205
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,790
talks I'm sorry we had a whole day full

206
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,180
of technical stuff um I'm not gonna just

207
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,190
offer my perspective on what's wrong I'm

208
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,050
gonna try to give solutions they may be

209
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,120
horrible solutions because I am not

210
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,250
perfect I don't even adhere to all the

211
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,030
solutions I suggest i am not a person

212
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,650
who actually should even be here making

213
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,020
these suggestions but i'm just trying to

214
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,940
start the discussion so people like

215
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,610
yourselves who are better to solve these

216
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,600
solutions can go forward with them I

217
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,490
haven't really ever I haven't always

218
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,810
been like this I used to speak about

219
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,180
technical content node serial port stuff

220
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,960
like that but all that changed when I

221
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,280
unfortunately didn't see video but all

222
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,470
that changed when I watched and

223
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,240
witnessed the birth of my little

224
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,840
daughter it is an impressive moment and

225
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,160
really something that changes your

226
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,400
entire world fatherhood has an amazing

227
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,870
way of kicking you in the ass and

228
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,700
helping you to see really what matters

229
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,100
in this world and so it's because that

230
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,960
reason that I'm here to talk to you

231
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,380
today all my desk at work is a little

232
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,050
metal plaque it engraved on it is the

233
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,140
words what would you do if you knew you

234
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,720
could not fail

235
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,480
I'm gonna say that again if you wouldn't

236
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,370
mind just playing along with me and

237
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,319
close your eyes when I say I'd greatly

238
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:59,459
appreciate it what would you do if you

239
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:05,610
knew you could not fail the co-worker of

240
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,529
mine gave this to me this plaque to me

241
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:10,230
when I was just out of college young kid

242
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,779
I thought it was worthless threw it in

243
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,730
the bottom of my desk drawer pretty much

244
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,079
assumed it was a tchotchke that I'd

245
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,629
never use and then over the course of a

246
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,009
couple years I pulled it back out and I

247
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,569
put it on my desk and I'd look at it and

248
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,790
I kept thinking you know is something to

249
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,129
that what if we couldn't fail what would

250
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:28,230
we do and so I ended up deciding to

251
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,970
dedicate my life to that sorter that

252
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,370
very simple saying what would I do if I

253
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,790
knew I couldn't fail I right now run a

254
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,459
start-up I throw seven conferences a

255
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,000
year I have one hell of a job as a

256
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,699
flower delivery guy because my wife runs

257
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:47,399
a floral design business and I have the

258
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,589
incredible honor and privilege to be

259
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:53,309
raising a beautiful baby girl I do all

260
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:55,410
this because I kind of throw caution and

261
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,699
a lot of good advice to the wind I try

262
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,129
to live life to the fullest and as most

263
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,720
you probably know if you've been out at

264
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,910
the parties I generally tell sleep to

265
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,269
you know sleepy damned and just try to

266
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,050
take life all in one thing has plagued

267
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,779
me when you do when you live this sort

268
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,290
of life when you say what happens if I

269
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,089
could do anything I want and I will not

270
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:24,059
fail you put yourself out there in great

271
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,930
risk entrepreneurs this culture that we

272
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,360
live in is very entrepreneurial focused

273
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,059
we are a risk-taking people we have to

274
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,149
be we are unlike any other industry in

275
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,389
the world we can take nothing open up

276
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:42,680
our laptop create magic in under a day

277
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,540
in 3d too

278
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,920
by a show of hands how many of you were

279
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,279
on a company or have run a company or

280
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,770
work in a company of Grigor of less than

281
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,180
20 okay how many of you have open source

282
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,990
software or hardware awesome all of you

283
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,390
are risk takers that raised your hand

284
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,860
and those that didn't you are risk

285
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,779
takers as well at heart now I know it

otherwise you wouldn't be here I mean

287
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,839
party last night was a big risk and be a

288
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,459
risk taker means you have opened

289
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,080
yourself up to a great deal of exposure

290
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,870
you've put yourself out there when you

291
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,029
open source something when you put

292
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,370
something out in public I that's a part

293
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,830
of yourself a part of your soul a part

294
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,170
of your spirit that is out there in the

295
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,410
open most people don't know this but

296
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,550
James conf was a huge mistake when I say

297
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,660
hellooo when I started jazz comp my wife

298
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,300
and I um we didn't started thinking hey

299
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,520
let's create an amazing conference we

300
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,520
started accidentally with me at a bar

301
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,560
saying I want to go to a JavaScript

302
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,170
conference I didn't find one so instead

303
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,690
of ticket sales we sold four tickets

304
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,250
over two months as those of you who know

305
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,870
conference over who have organized a

306
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,250
conference for tickets to two months is

307
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,360
not a good thing we were having to sign

308
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,070
on the hotel where we did the first

309
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,480
years come from we were putting our

310
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,790
entire lives at stake meanwhile hacker

311
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,560
news everyone was trashing us because we

312
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,820
have no idea what we're doing were

313
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,600
idiots this is a horrible idea we signed

314
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,450
the lease on the hotel at the same time

315
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,670
we marked it as sold out or we were

316
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,870
about to send Elise we mark the

317
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,010
conference's sold out because I was

318
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,839
trying to pull out and save face I was

319
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,070
gonna refund all the tickets and walk

320
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,399
away I share this story with you because

321
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,740
a lot of people think jazz cough comes

322
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,529
naturally and we put a lot of risk into

323
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,990
it and we do everything we can to make

324
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,700
it as crazy as possible because we

325
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,529
believe that's what you want and that's

326
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:58,700
what we want to give

327
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,350
to you when we marked it as sold out

328
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,020
everyone bought a ticket yay so luckily

329
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,400
I didn't get a divorce after that which

330
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,250
was a great thing but it's something

331
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,400
that that people have asked me numerous

332
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,930
times how did you come up with this idea

333
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,090
and it's complete and total dumb luck we

334
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,060
are risk takers we are all risk-takers

335
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,250
and that means we put our souls out

336
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,400
there and we put ourselves out there and

337
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,580
i quickly mentioned it but we have

338
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,750
failed each other in doing this we as

339
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,230
developers as designers as friends have

340
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,240
failed one another I have watched

341
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,460
negativity hate no I know this is just

342
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,750
to listen don't watch this is playing

343
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,230
negativity hate sarcasm completely and

344
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,030
totally dominate our community and our

345
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,430
world and I am just as guilty as

346
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,250
everybody else so I'm not coming here as

347
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,190
somebody who's doing it right we we

348
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,930
allow this to happen so much so that we

349
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,180
even have words for local isms for it

350
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,160
called trolling you guys have heard of

351
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,810
this by a show of hands how many of you

352
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:21,140
have experienced being trolled that is a

353
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,190
lot of people when you experience this a

354
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,590
part of your soul a part of you a part

355
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,590
of your energy dies and I hate that

356
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,270
because all of this leads to is stifling

357
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,680
innovation preventing invention ruining

358
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,500
our risk-taking ability but most of all

359
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,260
it kills our ability to be happy

360
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,920
developers and it's not random people

361
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,020
doing it it's ourselves doing it to

362
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,790
ourselves many say they love jazz comp

363
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,580
because we come together as a family we

364
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,560
may joke with one another and we may rib

365
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,240
each other but we know that we're all

366
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,410
friends and we leave

367
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,569
better friends and almost like a family

368
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,459
that's why we do the group photo at the

369
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,060
end it sickens me every time I leave

370
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,190
jazz conf we are here with so much

371
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,139
energy and so much happiness and really

372
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,790
we leave wanting to change the world and

373
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,990
then we'll get home and we'll open up

374
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,060
hacker news or we'll open up right it

375
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,519
will open up IRC or we'll open up github

376
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,519
issue 28 and we'll see this trolling

377
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,629
this evil this negativity this battling

378
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:32,399
all over the place and it really makes

379
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,579
you say why should I keep doing it every

380
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,129
time after a jazz cough I'd look to

381
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,750
laura and i say i'm not doing this ever

382
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,120
again I can't bring myself to go through

383
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,610
this again and I'm sure that those you

384
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,860
who've raised her hand have felt that

385
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,310
way at some point in time I've watched

386
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,519
social networks rise and

387
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,959
disproportionately destroy our social

388
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,889
human networks our friendships are

389
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:03,629
colleagues the fake anonymity of the web

390
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:06,000
has been turned into a platform for

391
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
promoting self-worth at the cost of

392
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,740
everything and everyone that runs

393
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,939
contrary to that person when our friends

394
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,829
launched something or release something

395
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,260
into this firing squad the best we can

396
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,600
do is we can can console them with words

397
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,559
like you have to have a tough skin or

398
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,770
haters gonna hate today I'm going to

399
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,200
call on that we need to stop

400
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,049
blaming victims we need to understand

401
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:36,960
the risk that others take and understand

402
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,169
that we will or we are all taking

403
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:44,010
similar risks as well last year I made a

404
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,159
call to improve our community this year

405
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,650
I'd like to make a new coal that we

406
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,200
improve ourselves and we be the change

407
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,830
that we want to see in the world

408
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,330
following along from last year how many

409
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:04,830
of you code in PHP have how many you

410
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:11,179
have coated in Ruby Python Perl see

411
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:16,140
algal

412
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,620
how many of you think any of that

413
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:27,480
matters so why do we have battles

414
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,740
these are tools they are not religions

415
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,260
we need to understand that and we need

416
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,360
to believe within that we need to commit

417
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,900
to what is right and not what feels good

418
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:43,280
we are a family here outside in our

419
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,340
community we are a family of developers

420
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,770
when I talk to people about the magic

421
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,900
that is jazz conf I'm not talking about

422
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,910
the amazing food I'm not talking about

423
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,830
the crazy parties I'm not talking about

424
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,510
the beer available whenever you want it

425
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,730
what I'm talking about is that sense of

426
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,890
when you leave and it's almost like

427
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,050
you're leaving grandmas house and your

428
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,430
brothers and sisters are there and

429
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,770
you've met everyone and god it feels so

430
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,870
good and at any moment you could call it

431
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,480
Nikolai and say dude how do I make the

432
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,030
Russian and he'll help you out he'll

433
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,590
probably ship it to you but I'm not

434
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,390
coming here just to say this is what's

435
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,600
wrong peace I'm here to try to offer

436
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,300
some solutions or at least ideas like

437
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,760
last year my intent is not to solve all

438
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,340
of the world's problems all of the time

439
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,710
but at least to give you all a spark

440
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,960
that you can light a fire with and go

441
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,100
home and maybe we can all change this so

442
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,500
here's the first of my suggestions I'm

443
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,170
gonna call it kids in the back and this

444
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,390
comes from discussing with the man back

445
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,540
there and a man who isn't here Brendan

446
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,140
and Alex Alex Russell those two like to

447
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,630
have discussions people like to get

448
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,180
involved in their discussions so what I

449
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,400
made the suggestion of is when they are

450
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,410
get into one of these discussions I'm

451
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,840
gonna suggest kids in the back if it

452
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,780
gets above three thread balance what

453
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,450
that means is hey just like if you're

454
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,860
driving in a car and you have the kid in

455
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,210
the back and you and your spouse are

456
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,070
driving driving you know I don't really

457
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,870
like McDonald's well I love McDonald

458
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,360
with that animosity that fighting the

459
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,570
kids see that and they learn this and so

460
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,460
we as as role models and you don't even

461
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,020
know her role models but we are role

462
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,090
models we need to understand that there

463
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,010
are kids in the back who are watching us

464
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,110
seeing what we do thinking that's

465
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,080
acceptable behave

466
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,179
here and we need to discipline ourselves

467
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,659
to say there are kids in the back why

468
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:40,830
don't we go out out of band

469
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,070
communication and talk directly I don't

470
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,500
think that's asking too much that if we

471
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,510
have something that gets very heated you

472
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,820
take it off of a public channel then

473
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,549
people aren't fighting with pride they

474
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:54,929
don't have to show themselves and be

475
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:58,559
better just to pound their chests call

476
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,750
each other up we do have these things

477
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,580
called telephones they still work I

478
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,580
tried it doesn't work with the video but

479
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,149
does to Paul's mom I need you come to an

480
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,549
agreed-upon solution then post that back

481
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:14,100
up because you know what resolution is

482
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,630
great if you don't come up with a

483
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,820
resolution just let the three comments

484
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,889
it the internet disappears very quickly

485
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:23,850
but it does not forget the other is a

486
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,480
discussion of public versus private we

487
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,940
should honor respect and be very

488
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,090
positive in public the two gentlemen up

489
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,940
here do absolutely amazing things and

490
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,830
that's why I wanted them both to come up

491
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,289
they are some of the best people that we

492
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:42,029
have in the community they're pushing

493
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:44,779
boundaries they're doing amazing things

494
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:55,800
so thank you

495
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,690
you guys can go back if you want or you

496
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,610
can sit here it's up to you you guys can

497
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,690
go back to your seat if you want or you

498
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,920
can stay here it's up to you i just

499
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,150
wanted to all right good now i know that

500
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,380
in javascript we don't really have a

501
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,420
concept of private variables so what

502
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,290
we're gonna do is we're going to closure

503
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,740
the next um negative comments negative

504
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,450
discussions anything that might be

505
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,160
negative we can just take those into

506
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,380
them private let's separate those bands

507
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,660
of communication when you talk to

508
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,060
someone privately about an issue when

509
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,580
you come up and say hey I have an issue

510
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,770
with something that you said you'll be

511
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,900
quite impressed at how much better the

512
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,380
communication happens if you do it on

513
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:41,140
the internet it always goes bad the next

514
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,160
suggestion be willing to stand up to the

515
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,220
haters and I'm not talking about the

516
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,820
person who's getting hated on I'm

517
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,440
talking about instead of telling our

518
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,120
friends they gotta suck it up and deal

519
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,780
with it be there to say hey I see that

520
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,580
you have a problem why don't we talk

521
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,250
about it instead of you in them I'm much

522
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,780
more better because I'm not connected to

523
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,930
that but I this is my friend let's talk

524
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,700
every attack every negative comment is

525
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,580
one more thing preventing us from taking

526
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,650
risks from living out the earlier quote

527
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,270
from living life as if we could not fail

528
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,510
and remember and think back to when you

529
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,580
had your eyes closed what could you do

530
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,410
if you knew you couldn't fail a wise man

531
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,510
once said on this continent his name was

532
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,850
Theodore Roosevelt he was a president of

533
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,490
the United States he gave a speech

534
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,980
called citizenship in the Republic in

535
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,980
1910 I'm going to read this because I

536
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,600
want to get it exactly right but I want

537
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,890
you just to listen to it it is not the

538
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,370
critic who counts not the man who points

539
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,640
out how the strong man stumbles or where

540
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,790
the doer of Deeds could have done them

541
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,120
better the credit belongs to the man who

542
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,620
is act

543
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,070
in the arena whose face is marred with

544
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,970
dust and sweat and blood who strives

545
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,230
valiantly who heirs who comes short

546
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,140
again and again because there is no

547
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,400
effort without error and shortcoming but

548
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,390
who does actually strive to do the deeds

549
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,390
he who knows great enthusiasms the great

550
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,200
devotions who spends himself any worthy

551
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,110
cause Who at the best knows in the end

552
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,410
the triumph of high achievement and who

553
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,010
had the worst if he fails at least fails

554
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,280
while daring greatly so that his place

555
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,429
shall never be with those cold timid

556
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:59,460
souls who neither know victory nor

557
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:07,290
defeat we have to stop the negativity we

558
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,920
have to change our world we have to

559
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,490
start by changing ourselves if there is

560
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,320
one thing you take away from this talk

561
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,490
there's one thing you do please do this

562
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,050
when you see someone taking the risk

563
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,720
when you see someone being the man or

564
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,910
woman in the arena when their face is

565
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,630
bloody and marred and dirty stand up

566
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,130
next to them support them talk to the

567
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,230
people who are coming at them talk to

568
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,580
the critics but do it and this is key do

569
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,250
it with positivity and not more hate

570
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,520
come together as friends and not as

571
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,890
enemies because the person in the arena

572
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,470
is already fighting a battle and if you

573
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,720
address the other person and not to me

574
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,710
to him he's just there if you address

575
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,870
the other person as a friend with

576
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,600
positivity like hey you want to go get a

577
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,860
beer because that seemed a little bit

578
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,500
harsh is something the matter we could

579
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,630
talk it out no worries every time I've

580
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,250
done this with someone i found out that

581
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,250
what was what happened was somebody was

582
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:17,850
negative on

583
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,590
where someone said their projects sucked

584
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,840
or they wrote a long run a wrong line of

585
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,750
code and it perpetuates and spins the

586
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,549
cycle but one thing I've learned is that

587
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:29,210
if we stand up and we say hey it's okay

588
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,880
that line of code was also let's not go

589
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,160
fight not anyone else once you do that

590
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,650
we can turn the tide back and we can

591
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,419
bring happiness innovation invention and

592
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:45,539
pride and most importantly our happiness

593
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:51,480
and fulfillment into this industry this

594
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,070
will be very hard to do the first couple

595
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,330
times you attempt it because most people

596
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,610
stand up and and just want to be

597
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,720
negative when they want to be negative

598
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,110
but if you do this if you do this for a

599
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,929
colleague then you're doing it for all

600
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:10,320
the rest of us as well and in return I

601
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,750
can ensure you that we will be doing it

602
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,289
for you just the same and so I'd like to

603
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:18,330
wish you a good night and thank you very
