1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,620

123456 yeah okay right here me yeah yes

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,320
now sweet okay great for those of you

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,080
that are here to listen to the talk

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,299
encouraging move as close as you can to

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,800
the front i'm going to doing a lot of

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,630
coding examples and it's going to be

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,310
very different it may be very difficult

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,470
for you to see towards the back so it's

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:30,810
up to you as far as where you sit out so

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,070
welcome what I won't be covering today

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,320
is internationalization as well as a

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,300
localization because one without the

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,270
other kind of the purpose is defeated

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,190
and my name is Ben I'm a developer

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,110
advocate for IBM bluemix which is a

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,270
platform as a service similar to as your

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,170
Roku what have you but has some unique

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,210
offerings and services that kind of

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,530
separate it but it does have a lot of

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,739
the same runtimes containers virtual

21
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,530
machines etc that you're going to get

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,480
you know with most any platform as a

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,880
service so what are we talking about

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,540
today is internationalization which has

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,290
a short acronym I think may be 4i 18 and

26
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,180
excuse me so internationalization is the

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,159
process of developing products in such a

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,810
way that they can be localized for

29
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,299
languages and cultural cultures easily

30
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,700
for application developers which is most

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,280
likely everyone here in the room

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,329
internationalizing an application means

33
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,829
it's dragging all the strings and other

34
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,740
local specific bits such as date or

35
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,950
currency format out of the application

36
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,460
and so i'll just open up a browser here

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,399
head to amazon and to give you an

38
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,249
example what this would look like is

39
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,720
stay at amazon okay you'll see here that

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,490
as you check out the page and click on a

41
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,030
cyber monday deal and we'll check out

42
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,219
this really sweet racer so this is

43
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,990
delivered in English which is probably

44
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,459
the most common language but what if

45
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,619
someone in the Czech Republic was

46
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,330
looking at this and I wanted to see this

47
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,680
web page and

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,260
Jack what a application developer at

49
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,209
amazon would do is would go through let

50
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:19,590
me blow this up a little bit make a

51
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,230
little bit easier to see and they would

52
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,319
take all the text so such as this title

53
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,859
right here the currency here this

54
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:31,670
information that's right here and

55
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,840
everything all throughout as well as

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,560
numbers for quantity things like 2.5 if

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,349
you most a lot of language especially

58
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,450
European languages why have a comma

59
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,450
instead of a decimal point in that place

60
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,019
and so you'd abstract all of those

61
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,540
snippets of text strings and numbers and

62
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,000
then process them based upon the

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,030
language that was requested along with

64
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,389
the web page a bad thing to do and if

65
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,879
you want to get really really difficult

66
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,959
when it comes to application development

67
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,569
you want to embed text inside of images

68
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,930
and you want to be friendly to

69
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,040
international crowd or multiple

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,530
languages especially if for example if

71
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,060
you're developing applications from

72
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,889
Americans then you're pretty much set

73
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,099
you know English period you're done but

74
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,629
if you're developing for example in

75
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:24,209
Europe in which for example I was

76
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,290
talking to a developer from Belgium and

77
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,760
he was required develop language is

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,549
excuse me applications with Dutch French

79
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,159
and English and if you think about the

80
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,439
size of Belgium you know it's like

81
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,810
smaller than the size of Florida and so

82
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,449
and that doesn't include Spain for

83
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:46,169
spanish and italian and german and all

84
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,579
other languages that are within just a

85
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,439
couple hundred mile radius and so if

86
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,959
you're an application developer in

87
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,540
europe or something like that you really

88
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,620
have to keep this in mind and by

89
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,069
embedding text in an image that makes it

90
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,079
a poor user experience which we'll get

91
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,790
into a little bit later but

92
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,549
internationalisation would be grabbing

93
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,609
out these snippets right here that can

94
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:11,250
or should be translated so that way your

95
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,769
user can understand them in their native

96
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,130
language and culture so localization

97
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,840
which has an acronym of l10n is a

98
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,729
process of adapting applications and

99
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,740
text to enable their usability in a

100
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,400
particular cultural

101
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,830
linguistic market and localizing an

102
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,630
application means providing translations

103
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,100
and localized formats for those

104
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,430
abstracted bits so I'm going to give you

105
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,500
an example of what this looks like and

106
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,440
this is also using the library that I'm

107
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,340
going to do some examples in today so

108
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,100
format jas this was created and released

109
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,039
open source by yahoo and what this does

110
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,320
is let me see if i can blow this up

111
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,150
there's a very simple example in the

112
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,680
front that will kind of drive this

113
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,259
message home so let's say that you've

114
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,320
got a social media website and someone

115
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,880
shares that they've taken a thousand

116
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,289
photos on December fast 2015 well let's

117
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:11,889
say that somebody from let's go with

118
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:14,560
France visits that social media page and

119
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,669
that social media site of that

120
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:17,020
application wants to deliver that

121
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,389
content and a localized friendly version

122
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,820
for that user so if i switch to France

123
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,039
you see not only does the language

124
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:27,460
change but also for example the way that

125
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,070
the date right here is delivered in

126
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,690
English would be December fifth 2015

127
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,800
whereas in French the day is delivered

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,870
before the month and then a year and

129
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,970
then also you'll see here for 1,000

130
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,699
instead of having a comma and French

131
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,120
there's actually a space and let's look

132
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,979
at a different languages go of Japanese

133
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,240
I don't really know what to tell you

134
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,860
here but I imagine you into the

135
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,060
differences there if i look at

136
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,810
portuguese or Brazil you can see that

137
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,220
there can be quite a difference here

138
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,159
when it comes to the date and then for

139
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:11,770
the number right here in this case 1000

140
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,690
it's actually got a period so this can

141
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,570
become very complex if let's say you're

142
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,720
working on a product such as Google or

143
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,159
something like that and you want to be

144
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,680
friendly to as many languages as

145
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,169
possible because your product is can be

146
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:28,900
you know launched into multiple

147
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,460
different areas then this is really

148
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,470
important this can be also enormously

149
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,300
cumbersome if let's say you've got

150
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,060
hundreds or thousands of pages in order

151
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,010
to do this with doing custom strings

152
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,889
which is one way

153
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,650
doing this per page if i go to my amazon

154
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,039
if you can imagine doing a custom string

155
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,099
entry for each of these snippets right

156
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:52,949
here you'd go absolutely crazy and so

157
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,270
therefore having a tool that can help

158
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,969
you do this yahoo created this format

159
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:59,460
jsin and they open sourced it for our

160
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,009
benefit so that makes it a lot easier in

161
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,749
order for you to do that so in xmas

162
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:09,689
script internationalization was added to

163
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:14,430
spec in december of 2012 so built right

164
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,189
into the native JavaScript without using

165
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,020
any framework library what have you you

166
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,090
can by grabbing the language of the

167
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,770
browser so if you've got a computer open

168
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,300
if you just go to the web console see if

169
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,229
I can blew this up yeah I'll clear this

170
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,439
out if you type it's under the window

171
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,999
object so you can type window if you

172
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:46,949
want to but navigator dot language for

173
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,889
WebKit and what you get is in this case

174
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,379
English us because my browser is set up

175
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,889
for English us and so we can do with

176
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,899
JavaScript as you can grab that and then

177
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,930
whenever you want to format a date or a

178
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,909
number or what have you then ekman

179
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:05,939
script can grab your day to your number

180
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,449
what have you and then process it based

181
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,379
on this spec right here which is blown

182
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,389
up here let me see if I can find an

183
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,270
example here unfortunately xmas script

184
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,060
their spec just provides like a lot of

185
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,919
theory but it doesn't like ever really

186
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,360
have like a code example and I can make

187
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,729
it really difficult to I don't know if

188
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:32,940
there's any people on the committee here

189
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,070
but hint hint if you can kirkland if you

190
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,750
can throw us a bone somehow and so

191
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,880
instead of having to read through all of

192
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,449
this I forget where you can see the size

193
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:46,110
of this document is enormous but that

194
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,529
there are methods I'm sorry I can't find

195
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,149
them right here but what there are

196
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:53,490
methods in which you can translate a

197
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,960
like a date or a number what have you

198
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,810
very easily without using a third-party

199
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,690
library in order to do that but there is

200
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,360
an issue unfortunately with the

201
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,430
compatibility of this because well I

202
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,450
guess you can see if you're welcome let

203
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,900
me open the actual source page so on can

204
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,930
i use you can see in the

205
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,520
internationalization api that is from

206
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,880
2012 you can see some glaring holes here

207
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,160
in an explorer it depends on what you're

208
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,290
supporting but for anything explorer 8 9

209
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,200
and 10 it's not supported at all you can

210
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,120
see here looks like we've only got one

211
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,310
percent one percent one percent but this

212
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,810
is the big hole right here which is

213
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,280
safari in iOS safari so we've got here

214
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,550
not an enormous amount I OS Safari

215
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,040
number one's got five percent but

216
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,600
depending upon your market especially if

217
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,710
you're going to which developers a lot

218
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,410
of developers use Apple and so far it

219
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,580
might be a browser to use most

220
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,820
especially for iPhones that's enormous

221
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,350
mobile views I think crested already

222
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,720
fifty percent of web page views out

223
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,010
there and so depending upon the product

224
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,200
that you're creating the fewer creating

225
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,900
a web app that needs to be

226
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,280
internationalized and localized for the

227
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,750
people that are viewing it and you're

228
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,240
relying on that native support this is

229
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,520
missing from these browsers I have no

230
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,210
idea why a standard from three almost

231
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,970
four years ago has not has not been

232
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,770
implemented in these browsers chrome

233
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,130
though and Firefox as well as the latest

234
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,930
version being explored to support that

235
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,840
so you do have that caveat to work with

236
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,280
so the importance of

237
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,170
internationalization we've shown you a

238
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,350
little bit of an example here with

239
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,570
Amazon but partial or complete exclusion

240
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,180
internationalisation severely affects

241
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,560
your users experience with the product

242
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,710
and I'll give you an example right here

243
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:46,570
this is trenitalia which is a train

244
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,270
service in Italy I was there about a

245
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,060
month two ago and this is the train

246
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,550
service that goes all throughout Italy

247
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,110
and what you can see here is that you

248
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,920
see here that's a really nice feature

249
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,780
out if you saw that bar down I get to

250
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,680
that but

251
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,380
let's say that you've got someone from

252
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,170
Germany that wants to take a train in

253
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,740
Italy if this site did not offer

254
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,000
translations then options could be

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,770
incredibly limited now you can use

256
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,360
something like babelfish so if you go to

257
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,570
you know google translator babelfish and

258
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,270
insert the web page that way then you

259
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,590
can see the translation but as you

260
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,240
progress through the checkout as you

261
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,130
progress few pages then you start having

262
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,960
issues with cookies and other things

263
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,580
like that for session persistence and so

264
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,540
you can get all the way through to a

265
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,000
purchase page and then because of the

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,820
way that the web page is kind being

267
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,040
rendered inside of babelfish or google

268
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,900
translate or what have you it's just not

269
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,550
a situation to work unless you just have

270
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,580
a text page and also too I could pointed

271
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,260
out all of these images right here like

272
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,580
you can see up here I've got a drop down

273
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:57,440
here at italiano if i go to french the

274
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:07,940
image is let me go to english here the

275
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,470
images in this case this is a surprise

276
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,090
to me this wasn't working this wasn't

277
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,690
the case yesterday but in in this case

278
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,690
the image is with the text that is

279
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,250
flattened right into the image changes

280
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,830
if that is not the case then even though

281
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,360
you might have text that is translated

282
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,490
having an image with text and it isn't

283
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,350
translated can result in a lot of

284
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,170
bounces and people not being able to use

285
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,110
your product at all there is a option

286
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,580
here mate see if I can get to pop up

287
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,170
again the hopefully I can see this in

288
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,940
google chrome this is a great option

289
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,220
where you can translate a page

290
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,020
especially if you're visiting pages for

291
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,760
example government pages are terrible at

292
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,130
this like I was visiting a page for the

293
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,900
United Arab Emirates which is an Arabic

294
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,610
and they don't have a natural

295
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,170
translation so without this I would've

296
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,170
been really really up a creek and what

297
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,730
google chrome does is recognizes the

298
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,350
language that my browser uses which in

299
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,150
this case is english and then allows me

300
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,910
to translate right here within the page

301
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,550
all the text strings that it recognizes

302
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,650
and it will also properly translate

303
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,260
dates numbers things like that

304
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,900
currencies for me and it does that right

305
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,590
within the browser

306
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,090
this is an enormous tool this is not

307
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,050
something that's available in other

308
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,240
browsers but it's a great tool that is

309
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,400
available you shouldn't rely upon it but

310
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,430
this is something that will allow you to

311
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,400
do that exclusion of

312
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,110
internationalisation makes your product

313
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,080
inaccessible to non locale users this is

314
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,220
an Israeli news website and so you can

315
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,990
see right here notice something when it

316
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,730
comes to internationalization this is

317
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,430
important for CSS and page layout Hebrew

318
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,300
is a right-to-left text so is Arabic

319
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,410
Farsi etc whereas English German French

320
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,170
Italian etc is left to right and so when

321
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,050
you're developing your product getting

322
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,880
the user agents language should change

323
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,890
the CSS that you deliver the page format

324
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,630
to deliver and as well as the text as

325
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,460
well this topic is absolutely enormous

326
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,130
and I can't get it give an example of

327
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,720
every thing to consider but in this page

328
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,580
you can see there's no option anywhere

329
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,710
and someone can read Hebrew and pointed

330
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,290
out to me then please do but you can see

331
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,610
that there is no option to change

332
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,350
languages here and so if you're reading

333
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,110
a story for example last year in july i

334
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,000
was planning to travel to israel my trip

335
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,560
got canceled because of rocket fire and

336
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,090
as i'm trying to find out information

337
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,030
up-to-date information on the security

338
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,260
situation there these are the kind of

339
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,030
websites that i had to deal with and

340
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,280
thankfully with google chrome like gives

341
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,320
me an option here is the text of the

342
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,510
pages in hebrew no translated for me so

343
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,770
i can get the information that I need

344
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,420
but you also see from a user experience

345
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,780
standpoint this is a line right to left

346
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,440
and so this may not be an issue with you

347
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,760
know let's click on this page right here

348
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,420
this may not be an issue with just a

349
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,210
snippet of text and you can also to see

350
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,370
as I transition pages open there we go

351
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,200
great you can see here this creates a

352
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,860
readability if I'm reading this from an

353
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,420
english-language perspective having it

354
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,890
go from left from right to left is going

355
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,350
to create issues for me tracking line by

356
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,110
line as I go down and so there are

357
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,330
important things to keep in mind and

358
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,920
consider as you're trying to make your

359
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,329
website compile

360
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:35,809
for those users so what I'm going to

361
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,399
focus on for the remainder of this time

362
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,829
is implementing format jas I'm going to

363
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:41,569
try and say its framework and tool

364
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,689
agnostic as possible as I deliver this

365
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:46,939
information because that because you

366
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:48,410
depend upon your stack you might be

367
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,499
using ember Jas or angular what have you

368
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:52,850
for front-end templating might be using

369
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,980
dusty is on the back end for back end

370
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,660
templates or maybe you're super cool and

371
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,160
you're using ember on the front end and

372
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,119
the back end or you're using react with

373
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:04,699
having the front or back end but the

374
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:07,579
principles shouldn't matter the basic

375
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:08,360
steps when it comes to

376
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,970
internationalization is that first you

377
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,069
extract the text snippets that required

378
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:15,739
translation via some templating tool so

379
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:20,119
I created a very simple page looks like

380
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:25,189
this in which I have a date time number

381
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:27,230
percentage and currency these are common

382
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,569
things that are going to change based

383
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:32,420
upon someone's locale and the format

384
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,499
it's not just necessarily going to be a

385
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,929
translation of that text from like

386
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,689
December to dissent bruh you know for

387
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:41,869
French it's going to be also the change

388
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:44,239
in the way in which the date you know

389
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,939
the day is going to go before the month

390
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:51,470
format and I'm going to pull up my code

391
00:16:51,470 --> 00:17:03,319
here and I hope everyone can see it in

392
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,939
my page here for internationalization

393
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:06,889
the first step is that I'm grabbing in

394
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:12,319
this case i'm using handlebars which is

395
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,419
like a very bare-bones basic very

396
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:18,939
similar mustache j/s templates and it

397
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,970
grabs the information here that I want

398
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,850
to translate and based upon the users

399
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,039
language it will translate it for me so

400
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,590
I've got all the fields right here which

401
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,470
will go back to the browser I've got my

402
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,260
fields right here and I'm going to

403
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,850
extract those out to some sort of

404
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,440
templating in order to make them

405
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,659
available for translation to use for

406
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,950
some service

407
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,940
the next step is to set up detection for

408
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,919
the script for the users language and so

409
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:56,600
down here you can see I'm doing this on

410
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,200
the front end to begin with and so this

411
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,760
is can be this is pretty simple to do

412
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,200
detector you don't have to worry about

413
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,510
like grabbing HTML headers what have you

414
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,169
the accept language parameter and I HTML

415
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:12,470
header will tell you what the language

416
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,990
is going to be and I'm going to detect

417
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,760
that and grab that into a variable so

418
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,590
that way as I'm processing through my

419
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,730
data down here I grab it for the correct

420
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,809
language and then when it comes to pull

421
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,000
my server file right here when it comes

422
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,320
to doing it on server side than that can

423
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,330
be grabbed in your request header so I'm

424
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,340
using Express here but to the request

425
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,720
the header and they makes the accept

426
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,659
language header that comes across will

427
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:43,520
tell you what languages are accepted by

428
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,240
or desire to be accepted by that website

429
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,429
and then for each request you want to

430
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,600
process and deliver the correct

431
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,390
localized strings based on the user's

432
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,899
language and so to walk through this

433
00:18:56,899 --> 00:18:58,580
well first what I'll do is show you the

434
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,549
format JS website they did a really nice

435
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:04,010
job of putting this together it's always

436
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,899
nice when the website for a framer put

437
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,809
some aesthetically pleasing stuff

438
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,380
together but perform at jas there are

439
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,529
four integrations that they have done

440
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,669
automatically for you that makes it easy

441
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:21,049
if you use one of these languages to

442
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:25,270
pick it up dust Jas is from LinkedIn and

443
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,070
this would be all server-side rendering

444
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,120
to my knowledge it is talk here about

445
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,669
browser base and I have never used is

446
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:37,450
anyone here used us Jess in the browser

447
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,830
okay does it exist in a browser now or

448
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,000
has it always oh wow okay I'm sorry I

449
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,940
have always always used it on the server

450
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,010
side so there you go cool there's

451
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,549
handlebars which is most naturally

452
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:55,159
designed for in the browser but it can

453
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,060
also be rendered runtime and sir

454
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,420
ambridge is as well as react our

455
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,980
libraries that can run on server and

456
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,200
front end I would recommend front end it

457
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,670
can get to be kind of tricky depending

458
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,830
upon your implementation but if you are

459
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,600
doing server-side rendering every time

460
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,780
that you're going to change a language

461
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,640
you've got to resubmit the website to

462
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,830
the server have it process and return it

463
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,390
in pen upon somebody's connection

464
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,580
especially in developing areas for

465
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,890
example like India where the bandwidth

466
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,690
is severely choked by the factors of

467
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,610
billion people you're not a billion but

468
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,960
roughly about half a billion that are

469
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,060
trying to access the internet that can

470
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,220
take three four five seconds per page

471
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,620
you can also persist it if you're really

472
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,940
awesome of the cookie a token or

473
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,250
something like that that every time it

474
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,330
submits that it will recognize hey this

475
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,220
user wants french or something like that

476
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,460
but front end is going to be much

477
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,960
quicker in order for you just to change

478
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,610
the strings that are on there instead of

479
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,950
reprocessing the parcel processing page

480
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,830
on the back so with using handlebars how

481
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,980
many people have used handlebars in here

482
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,810
okay great so it's a very very very

483
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,160
simple format here would be right here

484
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,610
an example of that is using two curly

485
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:14,850
braces on each side and then having some

486
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,540
denotation of the variable in this case

487
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,910
it says price but there's also some

488
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,560
other parameters in here such as format

489
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,910
number which is going to tell our

490
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,100
library you can see it right here oops

491
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,740
now there we go right there to format a

492
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,640
number for us and then we want to add

493
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,500
currency to that so this is not just a

494
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,670
number but this is gonna be the price of

495
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,550
something and then the currency to put

496
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,680
that into and then we have our

497
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,940
information that handlebars is going to

498
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,290
use to render it so in this case I

499
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,730
locale is going to be us the context for

500
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,380
our template the price variable right

501
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,510
here is going to be one thousand dollars

502
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,960
and then this is going to be the

503
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,220
built-in handlebars method of template

504
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,200
and which it's going to accept a

505
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,300
parameter for a argument for our context

506
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,700
which is our data right here and then it

507
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,010
processes it with this international

508
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,990
plug-in which if you come

509
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,030
right here you see you will import

510
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,340
handlebars onto your page and then add

511
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,240
the internationalization special sauce

512
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,780
on top of that for you to render it and

513
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,900
then if you decide to do front end only

514
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,590
then you need to import the language in

515
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,510
this case French which I built my app

516
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,540
using English and French so you can

517
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,780
include you know five ten fifteen

518
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,790
what-have-you languages the great part

519
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,320
about doing this server side if you

520
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,330
decide to do that is as it says here in

521
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,470
nodejs the NPM package the data for all

522
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,260
150 plus languages is preloaded and does

523
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,900
not need to be loaded manually so that

524
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,700
can add a lot of overhead if you do in a

525
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,130
site like Google you know which is going

526
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,420
to have you know pretty much every

527
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,520
language available in it then front end

528
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,290
would likely not be the way to go on

529
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,570
that you could possibly include like the

530
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,490
top 10 languages and if that doesn't

531
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,950
work then you can do an AJAX call to

532
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,470
grab that script library from the server

533
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,240
and then bring it back depends on how

534
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,809
you want to do that so once I grab that

535
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:18,820
information here I'm a page and they

536
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,660
pull this up right here so I've got my

537
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,059
handlebars library my international

538
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:29,650
library and then I imported the French

539
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,080
library to show that to show the

540
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,110
different language support and then let

541
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,100
me on come on comment this there's a

542
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,200
polyfill called international Jas that

543
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,690
is necessary for Safari support so if

544
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,010
you're going to use this even if you're

545
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,660
using handlebars this library right here

546
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,910
you're going to need to include this for

547
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,280
Safari the north of that polyfill to

548
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,510
work there's anyone here that works for

549
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:57,790
apple or Safari then please a close that

550
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,190
hole for us and then I just included

551
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,870
jquery here this is not a requirement

552
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,480
but I just included for the sake of

553
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,280
making it easier to do Dom manipulation

554
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,170
as we're doing this so as my script run

555
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,640
so what I need to load all these scripts

556
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,250
ahead of time prior to execution of my

557
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,960
code I need to make sure that with

558
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,870
handlebars that I am registering this

559
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,000
international library so that way it

560
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,559
when it's processing those templates

561
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,419
it's

562
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,429
these things like formatted date

563
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,590
formatted time you can see here my

564
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,149
variable that I'm going to grab for my

565
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:32,960
JSON document is right here is a daytime

566
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,549
number percentage price etc that it what

567
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:39,809
needs to know to pick up what these

568
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:41,190
things are and then also these

569
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,169
parameters in passing like day month

570
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:45,539
year etc there's tons of different

571
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:49,350
apotheke can use to customize your page

572
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,950
to how you want it to look and so once I

573
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,159
registered that I threw in a document

574
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,799
ready function which waits for the whole

575
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,149
page to be loaded and then it grabs our

576
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:04,440
language which actually this is a

577
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,659
navigator is not on the top view it's

578
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,450
actually window got navigator but you

579
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,220
can just go with navigator works anyways

580
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,619
and then I've got to fall back here a

581
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:16,049
logic check that if my I'm only

582
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,940
supporting English and French in this

583
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,169
case and if it does not return navigator

584
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:25,489
language either returns undefined or

585
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,929
doesn't have English or French there I'm

586
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:29,070
going to deliver them English because

587
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,659
it's going to be most popular now here

588
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,460
what you can do all you can do also be a

589
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,340
smarter idea from user experiences have

590
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,559
a pop-up that says would you like to use

591
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,659
babelfish google translate or have some

592
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,489
other options that way your user isn't

593
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:43,470
stuck with that language and then a

594
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,840
firing off a function that I created

595
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,480
down here with the browser language that

596
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,259
was detected and so I'm going to grab my

597
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:57,269
handlebars content which if you're not

598
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:58,919
familiar with handlebars seems that most

599
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,730
people are handlebars execute in a

600
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,220
script tag that has this specific type

601
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,730
attached to a text /x / handlebars

602
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,970
/template and so if it's not within

603
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,590
there whenever this renders all of this

604
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,379
is going to be rendered as HTML and it's

605
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:20,889
not going to be able to be read by

606
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:23,190
handlebars after your commitment now a

607
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,149
lot of you probably used angular or eve

608
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:31,619
used whatever it's called ember and that

609
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:32,999
has automatic tag detection both

610
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:35,309
handlebars that is not the case and so

611
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:37,080
I'm going to grab that I'm a compiler

612
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,400
which which this does is this

613
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,590
this into the handlebar library and it

614
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,450
grabs the snippet tags that it needs in

615
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,830
this case my locality and from the

616
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,200
language imma grab is right from up here

617
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,990
and the Navigator language and then

618
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,790
here's my contacts on this page let's

619
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,130
say this was the information on a

620
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,710
product in a product catalog I've got

621
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,720
the price how many we've got in stock

622
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,990
maybe the percentage of you know sales

623
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,730
versus not something like that and then

624
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,480
the date and the time stamp to show the

625
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,860
difference when it comes to the

626
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,410
different language formats and then I'm

627
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,020
going to use the native method for our

628
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,270
handlebar as a template dropping that

629
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,610
data that I just showed you and I'm

630
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,160
going to replace it with the HTML this

631
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,970
is a well I'm gonna take the rendered

632
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,100
HTML that handlebars gave me and drop it

633
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,240
in this is definitely a no-no when it

634
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,300
comes to replacing nodes so like you

635
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,330
read in a node you you know edited and

636
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,520
you override it this can throw you all

637
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,730
sorts of issues but I'm just for the

638
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,410
sake of the simplicity in chianti that's

639
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,860
what it would look like so once I've got

640
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,540
all of that done I've also got two

641
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,280
buttons up here that allow me can seem

642
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,350
right here that I can manually change

643
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,960
the locale from US English and French if

644
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,690
I'd like to so once I load that up right

645
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,310
here so you can see this is probably

646
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,250
familiar to everyone here in the room

647
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,800
date time number percentage and currency

648
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,720
are all the way that we naturally would

649
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,220
think what am I click on the French

650
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,710
button what this will do is it will

651
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,980
nicely translate this not only in this

652
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,450
case will actually translate the name of

653
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,710
the month but will also translate the

654
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,550
format in which the date should be

655
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,590
you'll notice that the date here for

656
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,720
this number is actually day first not

657
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,310
month first like it would be in English

658
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:38,130
for the number this 47 thousands of

659
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,070
space now and their percentage is pretty

660
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,160
much the same the I think in English it

661
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,420
will be out of percentage be right there

662
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,130
in French I guess there's a space and

663
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,110
then for currency there's a space in

664
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,360
between right there and

665
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,179
I guess they add on the scent right

666
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,640
there with a comma and the US currency

667
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,610
which in the English language that

668
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,710
currency would go ahead of it right

669
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,600
there and so this is incredibly useful

670
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,130
if you're doing a shopping website or

671
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,360
something like that that's got thousands

672
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,679
of different products this will do that

673
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,140
for you and then also within here I'll

674
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,120
show you to the API here you can also do

675
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,679
more powerful things such as for example

676
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,460
yesterday today etc switches to French

677
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,490
and this will also translate common text

678
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,740
this does not include entire French

679
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,110
dictionary and it or you've got other

680
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,210
options here of like Japanese or

681
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,750
Portuguese for Brazil that includes

682
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,370
common phrases such as yesterday

683
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,820
December etc for you to use and then any

684
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,390
strings such as here my Amazon website

685
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,130
my product information about my

686
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,040
fisher-price Power Wheels Dune Racer

687
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,480
this would need to be text that you

688
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,200
manually insert or translate for you but

689
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,940
format Jas is a great job and I'll

690
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,950
scroll down here to give you an example

691
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,030
this allows a pluralization with text so

692
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,040
in this case we've got Annie took 1000

693
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,190
photos on December fifth and if I

694
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,059
translate this to French you'll see that

695
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:16,140
it will translate this string of text

696
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,179
for me and what it does is it correctly

697
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:19,679
puts because each language is going to

698
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,870
have you know sometimes noun before the

699
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,270
verb and set a verb before the noun or

700
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,010
they're going to have different ways on

701
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,580
how they affect nouns pronouns

702
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,910
descriptive adjectives and what this

703
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,320
will do is this will do this for you can

704
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,720
see you can kind of get this is the

705
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,850
language in which would look like so

706
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,419
this can get a bit tricky when it comes

707
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:47,160
to coding this in but this is a library

708
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,320
that can help you do some simple text

709
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,179
translations right there without having

710
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,460
to use any like third-party translation

711
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,130
at all I don't if you're on a government

712
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,780
website or health care or something that

713
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,910
the details are incredibly important and

714
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,679
I wouldn't rely on something like this

715
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,790
but if the details are not

716
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,470
you know depend upon something very

717
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,170
important than this is a service that

718
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:13,340
you can use and like here's another

719
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,900
example right here with more complex

720
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,910
trend transformation right here and it

721
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,400
does a very very good job of those

722
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,440
things the probably best way of using

723
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,640
this is a front and manipulation with

724
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,480
back-end rendering in the case of having

725
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,950
a site that's got multiple different

726
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,060
languages and needs to support so there

727
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:43,710
is a server-side version of this which

728
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,860
it's pretty simple in order to implement

729
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,900
this I've chosen to in this case you

730
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,410
musn't nodejs and we have our handlebars

731
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,360
library which this is the same front-end

732
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,060
library that you'd see on the browser

733
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,790
side page and this is the handlebars

734
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,830
international library and the code is

735
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,020
going to be pretty similar as well and

736
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,950
then I'm including the file system a

737
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:10,250
module in order to read in a file here

738
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,520
so whenever I launch up the server and

739
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,560
go to the root directory what I'm going

740
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,730
to do here this is important this is how

741
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,960
I'm going to detect the language because

742
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,580
I'm not this code is not running in

743
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,260
someone's browser and some I need to

744
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,190
grab that out of the header that is sent

745
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,760
to see what language and so if I i'm

746
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,670
just going to comment this out just to

747
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:40,730
show you OOP I'll just grab this right

748
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,950
here if you just see what this looks

749
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:54,280
like when it gets spit out

750
00:32:54,290 --> 00:33:04,980
how is this 36 36 oh there we go okay

751
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,620
great I'm going to localhost and then

752
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,030
want to do that you probably can't see

753
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,910
very well all we can see right here

754
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,130
english-to-english us which is being

755
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,620
sent from my browser is sent and that

756
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,630
request header and then the more simple

757
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,830
version of that distinguish because

758
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,170
there's English Great Britain English us

759
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,270
etc that will have different ways of

760
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,520
pronouncing for example color see olor

761
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,150
in great britain english is co l oh you

762
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,110
are and so that can make some difference

763
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:42,180
in some cases and so once i grab that i

764
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,590
can then just run if you're basically

765
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,170
the same code that i did before so i'm

766
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,700
using a file system here to grab my

767
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,190
server file now this is also this is not

768
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,250
built with scalability in mind it's just

769
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,330
a simple example but what I'll do here

770
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,870
is grab the HTML from my server file

771
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,750
right here so here's my HTML file and I

772
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,310
pulled out all that JavaScript that I

773
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,990
was at the bottom if I pull up browser

774
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,450
at JS to see all this logic and from and

775
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,310
script tags are here I'm just pulling

776
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,660
all this out and doing its server side

777
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,419
and you see that's missing there and

778
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,010
then I'm able to just basically take the

779
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,210
same exact JavaScript and run it through

780
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,940
here and then just send that result so I

781
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,890
read in HTML and sent it back in a

782
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,200
response and then it will have the

783
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,540
updated information there I didn't have

784
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:37,460
time to add in an option to change the

785
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,080
language manually like I showed you on

786
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,750
that button if I pull that up right here

787
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,800
to go back and forth like this and

788
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,600
obviously this is not scalable you'd

789
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,800
have to write this for each individual

790
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,890
page but whenever that is run then it

791
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,640
will spit out the same information

792
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,580
without having any logic on the front

793
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,150
end so close that up we've got to like

794
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,980
three minutes left I encourage you to

795
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,980
check out if you got

796
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,940
your laptop open check out format jes

797
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,310
and kind of click around you can see the

798
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,170
integrations they did a really really

799
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,090
good job and this is a supported by

800
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,670
yahoo and so you've got a strong

801
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,830
professional development team behind

802
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,440
this and you also know that's been

803
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,420
tested is yahoo's in like 170 countries

804
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,090
and so you know that they've tested it

805
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,070
well and this can be a really quick way

806
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,980
for you to in this case creating some

807
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,250
rack components that will then spit out

808
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,770
in this case the currency back to you

809
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,280
you can implement this in probably 10 15

810
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,619
minutes for just a basic page and then

811
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:47,070
you can make your site very quickly

812
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,880
international affirming that can make an

813
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,109
enormous difference when it comes to

814
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:52,060
user experience and something i didn't

815
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,290
harp on too much when it comes to

816
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,540
accessibility is that we should be

817
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,680
designing for a web that's inclusive and

818
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,820
if you don't have internationalization

819
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,520
even the most basic support of it then

820
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,190
there are users that you are excluding

821
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,109
from using your product or service that

822
00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:11,290
otherwise in this case can be done quite

823
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,619
easily depending upon the framework or

824
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,680
tool that you use so that's just about

825
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,410
it i'll be up here for the next session

826
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,330
starts in like five minutes i'll be

827
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,410
around here if you have any questions

828
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,940
anything thanks for coming hope you

829
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,440
learned a lot and have a great
