1
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:12,179

this is about node knockout and in

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,849
particular how to win no knockout so no

3
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,130
knockout is a 48-hour coding contest

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,289
using node is very similar to Rails

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,720
rumble this year it is at the end of

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,220
august again this is the second year and

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,289
oh so this is a massively multiplayer

8
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,720
website but since the Wi-Fi is out I

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,170
have I had a back-up plan which was a

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,809
you can use if you connect to Chi which

11
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,930
is my machine it should be sharing its

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,489
Wi-Fi and you should be able to achieve

13
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,559
that local and you should be able to

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,690
come and mess with my slides while I'm

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,030
on them and I encourage you to do it but

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,530
I encourage you also not to be an

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,870
asshole and say bad things because

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,170
that's not cool um but you should also

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,170
come and mock me if you want so there's

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,239
a random guy down here which is please

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,159
okay sweet um so let's go over here and

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:16,409
go to the slides um down down okay no

23
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,689
one still see that yeah kind of okay um

24
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:24,180
so again no not get for anyone who

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,310
hasn't done it before I kind of wet show

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,490
off the last ones with so one of the

27
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,799
winners with swarm nation which is not

28
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,869
as cool without anybody playing it so

29
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:34,890
I'm going to get that one even though

30
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,920
it's really cool um this was scraggly

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,540
now it's called wort square this is a

32
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,540
massively multiplayer scrabble game

33
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,750
which also like grows so these are all

34
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,240
little little tiles and this map got

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,310
huge but you also can't see it because

36
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,590
there's no Wi-Fi you're getting Wi-Fi

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,009
now maybe I should switch Oh shy call an

38
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,070
audible and switch networks I'm scared

39
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,680
I'm gonna do it no oh give me an IP

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,480
address just connect from my phone oh

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,050
crap dude led me astray wait wait wait

42
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:26,700
wait oh thank you so okay now we can

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,150
actually do some awesome things um so

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,800
yeah so this was one of the winners it's

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,800
a huge map of Scrabble tiles and that

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,620
one was pretty awesome this was one that

47
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,269
not in for node knockout but one that I

48
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:44,569
wrote which is massively multiplayer web

49
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,019
asteroids so screw that one do that and

50
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,610
actually I'm switching out to node

51
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,660
knockout calm and do this there it's the

52
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,000
same setup if I can get there go go go

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,980
go go faster over here hurry up little

54
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,550
dude so so I'm a consultant and one of

55
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,300
the things I specialize in is uh is

56
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,500
early stage startups and we helped

57
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,019
define product so also a way to call

58
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,120
this presentation is actually how to

59
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,069
build a minimally Viable Product in 48

60
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,400
hours so one of the things that I get

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,470
paid a lot of dollars to to do so what

62
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,510
do you care about no Tanaka first this

63
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,670
prizes of course last year we gave about

64
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,409
forty thousand dollars in prizes out

65
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,940
this year we hope to do better if you

66
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,709
haven't tried out note before you want

67
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,120
to try it out this is a great time to

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,250
try it out it's limited time you can

69
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,000
just do whatever you want and it's a

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,890
really easy commitment to just try out

71
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,890
note if there's an idea that you've had

72
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,150
that you haven't had time to do an

73
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,129
outside projects this is a great time to

74
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:01,830
do that also and submit it so the first

75
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,099
thing you need to know about any product

76
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,019
is you need to know your audience in

77
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,450
particular you need to know so you

78
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,159
should go and read the judging rules and

79
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,150
how judges work the the votes split

80
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,449
about 5050 judges are take up a large

81
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:19,590
portion of that

82
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,449
so you should actually go and check out

83
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,260
the judges the judges from last year was

84
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,419
a great set of judges we had like

85
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:32,820
brendan eich we had Ryan doll and John

86
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,590
Rezac people from VCS from sequoia

87
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,860
capital I think benchmark looking at

88
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,510
stuff so what you want to do is like you

89
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,340
go to this list you pick out like five

90
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,090
judges five random judges and you you

91
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,260
roughly google stock them and you try to

92
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,760
and you think to yourself would they get

93
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,220
my idea would they understand what I'm

94
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,910
trying to do and you want to try to get

95
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,340
in their minds and you validate your

96
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,570
idea against what they see and so

97
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,130
because because it's going to be a

98
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:11,090
normal person you might think that maybe

99
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,780
they nice advertisement you need need

100
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,760
need to think through that this year

101
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,720
we're gonna have a technology category

102
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,789
though so last year we had some entries

103
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,550
that were like a proxy server or some of

104
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,930
the technical things that most people

105
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,680
just don't get this year we're hoping to

106
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,880
to judge those better with the

107
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,950
technology category more details on that

108
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,130
forthcoming one other thing is that

109
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,440
these judges are looking at like 10 20

110
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,620
entries sometimes so if you can do it

111
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,330
without a login do it without a login

112
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,710
because no one likes to come up with

113
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,050
another username and password if you do

114
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,820
need a sign up then use Twitter use

115
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,190
Facebook all those general rules our

116
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,770
browser breakdown is really sweet so IE

117
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,810
accounted for one point eight percent of

118
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,889
all traffic so give a hand to that if

119
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,169
not then there's always socket i/o which

120
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,060
everybody uses anyway and falls back to

121
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,630
like I five I think so the other part of

122
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,070
the vote is the popular vote and you

123
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,590
want to I mean if you want to win the

124
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,940
popular vote you got to be popular the

125
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,560
easiest way to be popular is to be

126
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,240
newsworthy and the easiest way to be

127
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,780
newsworthy is to be controversial so I

128
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,300
mean controversy is not the hard to do

129
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,830
you can just throw up some porta-potties

130
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,510
on your website and your controversial a

131
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,840
little bit

132
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,310
people like tweet about how note

133
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,320
knockout has some porta-potties on its

134
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,480
website go check them out and other

135
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,170
people will come and check them out

136
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,630
there's also like scraggly last year was

137
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,280
the name scraggly is a little bit

138
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,170
controversial and and they tried to ride

139
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,720
that way for a little bit the other way

140
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,780
of course to be popular is what i like

141
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,180
to call brain hacking which is really

142
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,960
tapping into that um so people when they

143
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,370
when they make decisions are very

144
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,050
irrational and and and how they think

145
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,080
and choose to do things is just yeah

146
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,060
totally irrational and what you want to

147
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,710
do is from action to reward you want to

148
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,130
short circuit that that gap so things

149
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,410
like on your iPhone when you like get to

150
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,460
the edge and there's that little

151
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,180
bouncing that like animation it's just

152
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,320
pleasurable to like have your list

153
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,540
bounced back at you and so if you you'll

154
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,050
see people like just mindlessly like

155
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,220
bouncing their their endless because

156
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,610
it's it's just pleasurable this this

157
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,170
website right here rewards you for kind

158
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,780
of exploring and clicking around and

159
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,220
like this this monster just walking

160
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,320
around because it's it's fun to watch

161
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,530
this guy walk around so if you can work

162
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,330
that in as much as possible into your

163
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,670
entry then the more chances going to be

164
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,140
popular ah so you have about four months

165
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,750
between now and no knockout so that

166
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,090
gives you four months to figure out what

167
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,770
you want to do you can sketch everything

168
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,990
out and by the time coding rolls around

169
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,030
the coding phase rolls around that's 48

170
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,250
hours then you can just execute straight

171
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,640
up execute if you're going to be using a

172
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,050
library that you've never used before

173
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,490
you should probably try that out

174
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,440
beforehand if you can use a new

175
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,200
technology like Mongo or react or Redis

176
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,630
try it out a little bit and get get a

177
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,850
little feel for kind of what you're

178
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,980
going to be using it for of course not

179
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,340
your main tools get and gam core API you

180
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,460
want a nice tutorial of NPM I believe

181
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,600
Isaac's doing a walkthrough later when

182
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,200
you plan out your your future set you

183
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,780
want to be able easily divisible amongst

184
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,420
your team

185
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,220
so if you can have up to four people on

186
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,510
your team you want to be able to to farm

187
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,880
that work out amongst each other not not

188
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,540
step on each other's toes the other

189
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,589
thing you want to do is make sure that

190
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,209
your idea you're not going to finish

191
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:03,779
half your idea easily and you want to be

192
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,230
sure that half of your idea is still

193
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,260
viable you wanna you want to plan your

194
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,940
your idea out so that's kind of like an

195
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,680
onion and that you can just say you know

196
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
what that's not going to work I'm going

197
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,990
to cut scope and it's still gonna it is

198
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,490
kind of buggy because and I'm gonna

199
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,990
blame the network on that one that wants

200
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,100
to why it's buggy and you want to be

201
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,440
able to you want to be able to cut hack

202
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,699
your product down and have it still make

203
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:34,199
sense the best team probably is actually

204
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,110
two designers and to developers again

205
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,040
people really like pretty things even

206
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,930
even if it's a non-working pudding thing

207
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,760
they they'll give you more brownie

208
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,890
points than if it's a working ugly thing

209
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,170
so so if you can get to designers get

210
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,910
them so I like tests a lot but for this

211
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,800
competition they don't really make that

212
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,180
much sense tests generally will they

213
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,269
help make sure that things that you

214
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,600
don't use very often still work and they

215
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,730
make sure that it they kind of

216
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,079
communicate how you should be calling

217
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,870
code with this if you're not using

218
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,000
everything of your of your entry while

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,019
you're developing it then you're

220
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:19,890
probably doing something wrong and

221
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,329
you've probably actually cut that

222
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,570
feature and you're probably sitting in

223
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,970
the exact same room as as the guy that's

224
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,350
going to be using the code that you're

225
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,750
writing so you can just tell him what to

226
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,870
do let's move on so polishing so I don't

227
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,970
know if you know what dorodango is but

228
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,430
it's like a Japanese hobby where you uh

229
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,730
you get some mud and you form into a

230
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,430
ball you pull it all the the the water

231
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,050
and it becomes like a hard ball and then

232
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,300
you start polishing it a polish and

233
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,769
polish Polish polish it you get this

234
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:55,949
really shiny marble II looking thing it

235
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,540
looks really awesome but really it's

236
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,010
just a pile of mud and I

237
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,720
young Mythbusters they use some ostrich

238
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,330
feces and I think some lion feces they

239
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,120
did exact same thing it was very shiny

240
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,200
ball of that looked really awesome

241
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,570
and so you can take and just polish

242
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,810
the hell out of it it'll look awesome so

243
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,810
again allocate a good chunk of time to

244
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,610
to just polishing which is actually like

245
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,700
just cold dead links make sure that like

246
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,280
sign up to using it to the end makes

247
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,110
sense that people will find that way

248
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,250
through and just at least assign one

249
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,110
person to just be doing that for like

250
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,810
the last day the other thing actually a

251
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,070
little on the opposite of that is

252
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,160
smoking near so like if you kind of

253
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
cobble together a mobile version of the

254
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,830
thing that you're doing along with the

255
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,830
web thing say that you did that even

256
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,160
even most most people might not probably

257
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,810
won't even try it out but you say that

258
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,220
there's a mobile version this app to and

259
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,900
put a picture there they'll be like wow

260
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,610
they did a mobile app that's pretty

261
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,370
badass and you'll get brownie points for

262
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,670
it I don't know where pack minutes um so

263
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,170
I'm too old actually to probably be

264
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,050
doing these competitions anymore I can't

265
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,940
hang like the youngins and so I

266
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,830
definitely need to sleep and eat a lot

267
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,730
when I do this ah I I need a good amount

268
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,620
of sleep and I encourage you to also do

269
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,390
it some there was one guy I think that

270
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,180
stayed up for like thirty eight hours

271
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,230
but don't do that because you're just

272
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,820
going to be making stupid decisions by

273
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,010
the end take take breaks and also when

274
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,360
you're running into that problem that

275
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,460
just doesn't make sense anymore sketch

276
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,330
it out or stop and talk to your team

277
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,770
very very likely you're going to realize

278
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,690
that either like you're doing something

279
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,400
stupid or or that you just don't need

280
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,160
what you're working on so don't don't

281
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,100
lose time doing that stuff ah that's

282
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,930
actually about it um

283
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,220
I have like one minute for questions if

284
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,900
