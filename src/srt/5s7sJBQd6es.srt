1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:21,590

you

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,140


3
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,520
so this is 40 to the project when I came

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,080
here with like oh my god and he's going

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,180
to fill it with babes some super happy

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,300
to win this estate so as anjali say I'm

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,309
to happen at least say I'm working I'm

8
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,620
not syllabi day so I'm an absent genere

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,530
make-ups help people make apps but by

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,900
night I'm super solid so that's when I

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,510
get to make noises and like blue of my

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,089
neighbors so what we're going to see

13
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,010
today is first I'll just give you a

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,330
little bit of background so you know

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,360
where I came from then I'll see what I

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,479
build and then I'm going to blow up your

17
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,180
minds or your ears do you never know so

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,650
you know when you go in a plane and you

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,330
hit brace brace and the save you hit

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,180
brace brace discoveries so if you hear

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,430
that run because it's like it's growing

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,390
up and it's going to die materials so as

23
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,460
you might have understood I love music

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,360
and one of the first gifts i got when i

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,189
was a child was have blue vinyl like we

26
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,140
i thought i was like something like this

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,110
tall and i just couldn't stop listening

28
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,250
to that it was like one of those

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,920
horrible child bands he was like but i

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,500
just couldn't stop me so I was like can

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,820
I listen to die again and they were like

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,920
oh it was a turntable you couldn't just

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,900
put it in a loop like an itunes you had

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,360
to go put the needle back so it was like

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,520
this tall and the turntables here so it

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,110
was like trying to return it was like my

37
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,220
early Charlie and then the eighties were

38
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,330
good times so we had tea selector poop

39
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,350
maybe video games and Casio keyboard

40
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,930
amazing so this was mine it was like six

41
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,780
knots polyphony six or eight instruments

42
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,640
and serious it was like kind of limited

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,979
and from recording you had to record to

44
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,250
a tape which was an ideal but he was

45
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,110
fine and the 90s came about that man was

46
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,879
multimedia which was like oh my god see

47
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,760
the wrong players and stuff and truckers

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,019
and then you've heard about truckers

49
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,330
it's like a sample-based music program

50
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,530
so I could do lots of music and I got

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,799
into the demoscene as well which is like

52
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:34,409
graphics bit cubes everything all at the

53
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:35,660
same time and

54
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,180
Vijay which is like the same but with

55
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,000
realtor and I got who to go to live gigs

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,120
and I got someone to play some visuals

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,500
where I was playing music which was

58
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,990
pretty exciting but it's hard to connect

59
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,460
with people especially if your friends

60
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,290
live in another country like I like it

61
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,320
was this case um so I got like

62
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,030
introverted and got to software

63
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,100
synthesis and I start to building my own

64
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,060
since I self with C and C++ and I met

65
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,400
wait when instruments which is like a

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
technology so you can have synthesizers

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,150
with cubase or any other kind of so

68
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,250
we're probably that is that is hard to

69
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,370
distribute because can pilot part of the

70
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,600
SDK is proprietary so you can't

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,480
redistribute that and instructions for

72
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,790
building that are really confusing

73
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,440
because you had to say well this this

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,120
part you can use it but then you had to

75
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,820
go to cubase download something that I

76
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,250
can distribute because it's closer so it

77
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,230
was hard to get it to work for more

78
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,020
people than me even though some people

79
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,250
distributed that in line of

80
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,480
distributions which is pretty amazing

81
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,640
like it's so Harvard still people maybe

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,160
effort so that was exciting and then

83
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,870
he's like I yeah this is my time any God

84
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,959
wave Aldean shake yes well absolutely

85
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,140
and now she is and I could be a

86
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,910
one-woman westridge like I don't need

87
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,680
anyone else I can do everything myself

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,290
so I wanted all in below output and old

89
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,360
harbour input and I could do everything

90
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,870
with nodejs so I got this thing it's a

91
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,500
cuny harbor controller which is for

92
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,890
hackers um it's good pressure sensitive

93
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,989
part with le lives you can't really say

94
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:16,910
that because it's really right but there

95
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,020
are ladies here and it's a small oops um

96
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,290
the nice thing is that it uses GDP

97
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,930
either you've heard about GDP but it's

98
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,060
like a obviously you're fair about d I

99
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,370
mean obviously Oh opens how control it's

100
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,480
like a protocol you can use for

101
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,750
connecting between different instruments

102
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,890
and controllers everything it's like

103
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,729
maybe but modern like the will be big

104
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:48,229
brother of of midi so this thing comes

105
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,910
with something called oh you see Bree

106
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,220
which converts your USB data into

107
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,010
something that Oh any other internet

108
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,150
award program like nose candy chest um

109
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,430
so with a knife module that someone

110
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,050
already have made I could just read

111
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,510
whatever these things sends me and I can

112
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,040
also send things to that so for example

113
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,940
if I fabrice here it's just listening

114
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,680
the touch events i'm sending some just

115
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,200
getting messages here and then i can

116
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,510
also send messages here so i can control

117
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,920
the colors that you can't really see

118
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,800
again because it's very bright and then

119
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,810
that's for the input but what do we do

120
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,880
in in the browser because we want to

121
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,620
make it sound so so can you that's

122
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,160
evident um and then the way this works

123
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,700
is with open side control you kind of

124
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,550
subscribe to addresses it's like silence

125
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,290
it's like like URLs you can match things

126
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,420
with Richard recruit regular expressions

127
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,620
like these things so for example when I

128
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,500
press about I get sent a message with

129
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,290
data structure and again say I'm

130
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,940
interested only in present parts I'm

131
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,410
just describing to that I'm filtering

132
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,150
everything else and with socket i/o I'm

133
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,430
sending everything through from UDP to

134
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,220
this thing to the browser and just

135
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,990
listen to whatever i'm interested in and

136
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,230
then i can send messages again you can

137
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,510
see that but each part has like four

138
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,310
leds and i can control the red and the

139
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,500
green values so again i can turn the

140
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,480
whole thing red hold clean green or

141
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,950
somewhere in between and then that's for

142
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,070
the pub obviously had to do something

143
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,000
that might sound so previously i used to

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,810
build my old thing like total ignoring

145
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,830
all the opposition's using the script

146
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,780
notes I was like everything like it was

147
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,669
like if it was a still c++ but then i

148
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,560
thought that could do this with proper

149
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,980
web audio using only api from the audio

150
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,220
and make it very modular like i can

151
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,990
include one things and the other and

152
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,590
reuse as much as possible so the problem

153
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,910
with that is that the

154
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,490
very very native where all your stuff is

155
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,410
very very native and it's very very

156
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,840
limited so you had to write lots of

157
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,140
rubbers and for example the oscillators

158
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,930
when whatever our bow is just stops

159
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,570
playing it just disappears into the user

160
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,580
so you need to make something so that

161
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,080
you can detect okay this node has

162
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,690
finished you need to regenerate that so

163
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,760
you need to go making lots of little

164
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,930
things like that they are not very

165
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,270
difficult but they are not as intuitive

166
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,330
and they seem to be finding people by

167
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,150
surprise a lot and another thing that I

168
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,350
think it's interesting is I made a

169
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,720
little envelope I don't know if you know

170
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,960
about the envelopes it's basically if

171
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,750
you got an instrument and you pay always

172
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,050
in the same volume it's boring it's like

173
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,670
you need to give a little for expression

174
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,010
the way of doing that is having volume

175
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,300
changes so you can do love with

176
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,740
envelopes and develop is basically

177
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,770
attack decay sustain release so I build

178
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,470
that which kind of automates the way you

179
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,180
can change parameters we will audio

180
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,860
which is something like setvalue time

181
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,500
set parameter time that's given motor

182
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,630
blood all the time so you just automate

183
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,860
that with a class so that was for the

184
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,990
basic things but sometimes there were

185
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,300
times I didn't have enough things like

186
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,370
for example I wanted to multiply the

187
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,470
output of two nodes but I don't think

188
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,600
there's anything we roll it up that's it

189
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,690
so you can just shame it with a custom

190
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,380
node which is pretty good and obviously

191
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,220
you want to change things I'm a degree

192
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,719
and this is this is using this is

193
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:42,740
attached to whatever I created so it's

194
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,110
based on web component I don't know

195
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,480
about that thing so if it's very low

196
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,610
it's fine if it's not exactly shame

197
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,110
everything away and I just don't worry

198
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,870
about that so the way worse i create

199
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,730
instances with that and then i attach

200
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,070
them to real virtual instruments I

201
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,580
creative because has even faced whether

202
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,610
i do in the degree just reflect on the

203
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,440
instruments so i could be changed

204
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,730
the relief time and he should be

205
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,590
changing so it's longer release or sure

206
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,110
do so and if you change that

207
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,550
programmatically it would changes as

208
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,440
well but and I'm not going to life

209
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,290
program here so the first thing I wrote

210
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,840
was the bajo drone which is a funny Kim

211
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,510
howarth with the Spanish and English so

212
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,640
it's like based on and some more funny

213
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,070
multi voice in you unisonic bus lane so

214
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,220
it makes that it only plays one note

215
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,240
multi voices because it's got more than

216
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,100
one see later and unisonic is because

217
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,690
there are playing in different octaves

218
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,530
and its baseline so this is that and

219
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,260
then it made the coach inator which is

220
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,550
like it's like a pup pad a tour because

221
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,420
Colton in Spanish is a pub I just like

222
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,080
to make funny names for things so bill I

223
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,330
accepted her will likely you something

224
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,670
so i just took instances of the previous

225
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,110
instrument i put them inside these

226
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,330
things I've got like multi polyphonic

227
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,830
instrument just with the previous one

228
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,050
for this I had to create what they call

229
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,090
a voice allocation unit so you can

230
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,920
decide ok I've got three voices and

231
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,990
you're sending me four notes so the

232
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,330
first one is out so you need to

233
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,690
implement some sort of criteria for

234
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,150
building this thing and then it is porum

235
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,730
poem which is like drum machine because

236
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,160
prom poem in spanish is a way to kind of

237
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,880
represent the sound of a drum from pump

238
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,890
so it's just playing samples it's like

239
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:48,850
an 808 or 909 something like this and

240
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,100
then river I don't even know how to

241
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,520
process riverfront is I'm an impulse buy

242
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,670
uber model which I included off inside

243
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,100
the culture later because it what is

244
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,800
this thing you can see here actually the

245
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,720
the way for the river patrol is inside

246
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,339
the way for the other thing everything's

247
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:09,110
inside like the matrix or inception or

248
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,540
something so you can i'm using web audio

249
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,170
rebirth things so it's using samples for

250
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,699
representing how the reverb

251
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:22,519
be behaving it not sure it seemed very

252
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,999
well well basically they go to our room

253
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,309
my name to rule and put some mics

254
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:31,040
somewhere and they'd record and that's

255
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,889
what I'm because I'm that's one using

256
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:35,629
that's how they trigger the way they

257
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,540
sound reacts to different environments

258
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,790
so the nice thing is I'm whenever the

259
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,819
new bar is loaded I just load it and

260
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,769
draw it with canvas it's pretty amazing

261
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:47,809
I'm just throwing an OGG file here it's

262
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:52,040
like yeah I love this thing um so yeah

263
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,569
just back to the other thing um and

264
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:58,220
obviously you need something because

265
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,749
otherwise I can't be a one-woman

266
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:02,809
orchestra so I made something to go with

267
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:05,809
the music and that's of course where

268
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,079
jail by three hjs and the thing is that

269
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,720
I think this is something that many

270
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,639
people find confusing how do you render

271
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,069
many times of using only one renderer

272
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,119
it's very easy actually um I spent later

273
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,480
and i'm not going to complicate it with

274
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,249
these things because another 3d artist I

275
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:27,350
just made some cubes and stuff they look

276
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,480
kind of simple and minimal so that

277
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,989
should be fine so yeah the trick it's a

278
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,600
very simple trick you create the render

279
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,329
like this you say please don't delete

280
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:40,789
whatever when you're done and then don't

281
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:43,879
auto clear and then you want your render

282
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,410
you say it when there are clear ones and

283
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,559
then repeat primary for it's a scene you

284
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,689
want to render that should we do you

285
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:55,149
don't need anything else that's it and

286
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,699
for playing life obviously you can't be

287
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:01,220
doing everything at the same time so I I

288
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,799
don't know give her about renoise has

289
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,379
anyone used green ice or any trucker

290
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:11,600
ever now I can believe that okay so

291
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,309
basically now she's like a moderate

292
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:17,059
tracker and it's like any other

293
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:20,480
sequencer you basically prepare a song

294
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,769
with this thing um it's a tracker in the

295
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,569
future I will likely have my own web

296
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:28,759
editor but that would be like maybe 10

297
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,790
years sign when I

298
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,230
time enough for that so in the meantime

299
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,850
I just made the song with a newer

300
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,860
software like I'm not reinventing this

301
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,340
wheel this time so the good thing about

302
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,350
this editor is that the song for

303
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,710
Mattie's XML so but I don't want to use

304
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,170
XML so I sporty to Jason and there

305
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,150
wasn't any model for that so I made a no

306
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,780
they are not module for this and the

307
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,730
thing about tracker consider every like

308
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,030
way more than reason or qas or anything

309
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,720
is that it's got these concepts of

310
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,160
utterance tracks and roll and some

311
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,960
people say that it's like Excel because

312
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,160
it's like one page of data and its

313
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,630
numbers that's how you sequence that

314
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,960
it's very hard like so because it's like

315
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,330
pages of things and yes I place this

316
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,330
page in this order and pay this page

317
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,460
again and paste so it's like very easy

318
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,460
to know what's playing and when and

319
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,500
which row it is and everything so you

320
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,590
can make very recently with that and so

321
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,000
once you've got the orderlies which is

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,410
like this page and this page on this

323
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,510
page on this page you just what I'm

324
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,310
doing is I'm just creating a list of

325
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,710
events so i can know what to do when i

326
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,770
play life and this is kind of sabine

327
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,320
circuit like not own the node number

328
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,600
timestamp and then the order pattern

329
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,280
room does the thing that you can get

330
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,620
from the trackers and then instrument

331
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,330
volume less obvious so this is we show

332
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,510
you don't know what's playing and why do

333
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,490
you want to keep the order pattern on

334
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,210
the road because imagine you're playing

335
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,850
any sort of song and you want to keep

336
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,370
track of which bar door and so you can

337
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,530
make interesting tips with that so

338
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,250
that's why and you need to solve a time

339
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,370
stone axe ascending timestamp because

340
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,320
you need to schedule a all the events at

341
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,330
precise time so we say you're not going

342
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,980
to be trialled in india right at the

343
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,450
time because it's going to like mel your

344
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,410
browser so you want to make it like

345
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,700
prepared as much as possible before you

346
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,710
start doing the heavy thing so you

347
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,500
schedule everything a precise times but

348
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,960
the progress we've all the events that

349
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,160
you can't cancel them so you can just

350
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,570
prepare everything and send everything

351
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,899
to browser because if you

352
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,660
stop it or post it it's going to keep

353
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,819
playing you don't want to do that so

354
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,490
what you need to do is request audition

355
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,129
frame this is something I made up maybe

356
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,230
it's not the best thing but it kind of

357
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,930
works so well it does is periodically it

358
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,629
goes and looks at the list of events and

359
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,449
say okay so this buffer is this length

360
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:03,399
what can I fit in here okay so i'm just

361
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,839
going to dispatch things like play this

362
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,920
note and stop this thing and launch this

363
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,699
envelope and that kind of thing but the

364
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,029
promise that sometimes it can be off but

365
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:17,800
you need to be aware of what's going I

366
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,999
mean most of the people don't really

367
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,769
notice but again people don't even

368
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,350
notice one picture from pix elated and

369
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,910
say that it might be just curious like

370
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:30,699
me but is there and how do you make the

371
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,749
most of no data so the tracker gives me

372
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:38,709
this c4 things and you can convert into

373
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:41,769
me the node numbers and then because

374
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,499
it's numbers you can use maths which is

375
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:46,990
pretty ways amazing with music so for

376
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,660
example with maths you can say this note

377
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,600
for getting the higher take you just up

378
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,059
12 to the number so you can do this kind

379
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,490
of funny things like building chords or

380
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,249
our pages which is like Brewer and it's

381
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,319
all done with numbers so you just use

382
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:03,850
the note okay you complain things but

383
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,480
not the same thing and yeah why bother

384
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,939
wasn't residence the in Serge's like I

385
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,980
could just hope this thing to the output

386
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,250
and that should be enough but the

387
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,659
promise that for examples I've got a

388
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:20,860
bass drum like with you like and then

389
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,370
I've got a base and they both play in

390
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,589
the same frequency is hard for the

391
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,049
insert to say this is this is the drum

392
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,419
or this is the base so they can retail

393
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:34,029
so that way you still have you can still

394
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:36,940
have their 50 you want but you can also

395
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,799
know what's actually playing and which

396
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,110
node is it actually playing so that's

397
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,059
why I splain um yeah if you just answer

398
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:51,880
you need to deal with thresholds dark

399
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,650
indicate

400
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,130
and you know it's very different than he

401
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,110
can change from Santa song so it's not

402
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,860
true for all the songs so good chess

403
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,270
careful be very careful this is why I

404
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,100
warned you like sometimes these clips I

405
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,380
hope it doesn't but the first thing I

406
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,210
made they were I was like adding many

407
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,410
voices at the same time he was like I

408
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,640
just had to take my headphones off it

409
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,040
was like killing my ears so you need to

410
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,930
be very very aware of possibilities of

411
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,330
clipping so the solution for days that

412
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,030
you have limiters and compressors as

413
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,030
much as you can origin8 so that nothing

414
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,470
can go over 1 or minus 1 and the other

415
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,230
promise that it can break because it's

416
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,450
changing the I mean we've all the things

417
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,060
changing a lot especially for example

418
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,500
with nightly every day there are new

419
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,790
things happening changing improving up

420
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,300
until two days ago this was leaking like

421
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,990
heavily and you could close chrome he

422
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,820
was still playing and really why is it

423
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,650
playing there's nothing here yes close

424
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,330
the window but the window was a cinder

425
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,280
somewhere I don't know where but it was

426
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,840
there it didn't even show you an

427
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,030
activity monitor I don't know we're but

428
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,920
I guess it's part of the fun we are here

429
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,290
for having fun and breaking things and

430
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:20,490
joy in that so right ok good so let's

431
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,030
see if it breaks yeah remember about

432
00:19:24,030 --> 00:20:47,389
this thing

433
00:20:47,399 --> 00:22:41,409
you

434
00:22:41,419 --> 00:23:21,420

436
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:56,770

I think we're done right yeah awesome

439
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:14,600
can we get a round of applause awesome

440
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,160
to have a presentation that is worthy of

441
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,640
this set I feel like I'm a Eurovision do

442
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,630
we have any questions you have to raise

443
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,340
your hands we have a weave angeline on

444
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,900
Mike back there so even if you're back

445
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,880
there it's totally cool yes hi um so you

446
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,710
were playing like something with one

447
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,900
hand and and changing the settings with

448
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,070
the other yeah right would it be

449
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,590
possible to connect some kind of

450
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,700
controller so that you don't have to use

451
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,300
your mouse yeah I just need time ok

452
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,550
sorry theory you've got this thing where

453
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,910
you can have I mean this is like the

454
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,100
whole point of the sliders but I i

455
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,930
wanted to map it like instead of

456
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,460
pressing the mouse I could map this

457
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,390
thing but time I thought that was very
