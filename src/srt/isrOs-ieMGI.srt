2014 has been an amazing year I don't

2
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,460
usually say this but it might actually

3
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,550
be the best of all of them what I was

4
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,230
really excited about it was our opening

5
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,559
show that had 3d projection mapping it

6
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,300
was kind of an all-nighter so the the

7
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,399
crew that I was responsibly responsible

8
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,590
for this it took them till next morning

9
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,690
so that we really only saw it for the

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,910
first time at eight-fifty which was 40

11
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,780
minutes before we went to the actual

12
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,240
opening of the conference so I was so

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,280
glad it worked but i think was awesome

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,619
and i'm excited what we come up for next

15
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:25,060
year to outdo ourselves

16
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:43,040
you

17
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,510
hi I'm young I'm giving a talk about

18
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,900
with audio I fat end that jazz conf two

19
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,729
years ago and for the first time and

20
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,280
ever since I saw Stewart memos talking

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,890
Web Audio I was hooked I think Jess come

22
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,890
physical conference to actually get

23
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,680
started with speaking like it's they're

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,479
very open for speakers that haven't

25
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,190
spoken anywhere else before and I think

26
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,320
with today we've seen many people that

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,090
haven't spoken before any other

28
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,300
conference at all and they give you a

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,280
lot of feedback up front they help you

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,730
they make lists for you and I think is

31
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,100
perfect for for people who want to try

32
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,630
to talk although it's quite a big

33
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:38,300
conference but it's very open for that

34
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:49,470
I gave a talk about how I changed

35
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,680
careers in one year from no programming

36
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,349
experience at all to a hired program it

37
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,510
was rough it was hard but my talk is

38
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,550
about how I got so much help from so

39
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,110
many people in the community and how

40
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,840
awesome that was and trying to inspire

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,540
other people to help out I don't know

42
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,040
the whole atmosphere is just so friendly

43
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,319
and welcoming and all the talks have

44
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,350
been great and just with people seem

45
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:44,860
great

46
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,950
it seems like a really unique

47
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,380
opportunity it's a great conference very

48
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,760
well organized and it's just a really

49
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,790
interesting mix of people and I studied

50
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,440
Harry Potter in school so i wrote my

51
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,170
honors thesis on Harry Potter and when I

52
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,030
saw that the conference was asking for

53
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,520
speakers I thought maybe I could somehow

54
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,260
find a correlation between my learnings

55
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,880
from Harry Potter and how I could

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:15,020
related to JavaScript

57
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,620
um once I got past the initial nerves

58
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,359
once I stopped feeling like I was going

59
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,489
to throw up I think my talk went went

60
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,610
okay people laughing in the funny bits

61
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,110
and didn't laughter the not funny bits

62
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,480
which it's as best as I can expect

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,910
really live demo almost failed but it

64
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,490
worked in the end there are a few

65
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,930

66
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,970
