00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:23,359
thanks Justine and organized this today

3
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,249
I'm gonna talk about coding chatbots in

4
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:27,800
no js' so show of hands how many people

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,689
here build a chat bought before I can't

6
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,510
see very well but I do see a few hands

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,610
in front anybody is planning to build a

8
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,650
chat board okay a fear okay so this are

9
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,140
my lessons learned while I was trying to

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,650
build a chat board and hi my name is

11
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,070
khari

12
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,610
and I'm a JavaScript developer for the

13
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,800
past five years and work for tremor Vito

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,530
San Francisco which is an via video

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,290
advertising company and I work on nodejs

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,220
tools to recompile animate CC outputs

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,679
into JavaScript interactive

18
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:10,880
advertisements and I also am responsible

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,409
for the web USG chat bot so you could

20
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,899
try you could try talking to reboot SG

21
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:20,960
and just ask something like what are the

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,039
upcoming events and you you know that's

23
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,079
how I got started into chat BOTS and I

24
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,959
got started when Facebook just released

25
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,389
the Facebook ape messaging API and

26
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:36,740
Suhani who worked on reboot SG shared

27
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,109
with me her interest in trying to build

28
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:42,590
a chat bot for we boot and that's how I

29
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,649
got started you know I wanted to explore

30
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:47,869
Facebook messaging and she had

31
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:50,389
conveniently got a really good API which

32
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:51,950
if you haven't already checked out you

33
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,740
should it's a local community event

34
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,459
finder and that she on also mentioned

35
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:04,429
yesterday so I also like sushi yay yay

36
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:07,159
for sushi so what is the chat board

37
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,170
so a chat bar is designed to perform

38
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,540
tasks via chat user interface that

39
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,420
typically is texts enable

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,730
an example of tech symbol enabled chat

41
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,470
bot would be Facebook Messenger and

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,740
slack there are some voice enabled ones

43
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,030
such as cantana

44
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,170
and Amazon echo and but to me I see them

45
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,990
as personal assistants that perform one

46
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,209
or two thousand credibly well under the

47
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,150
given constraints so why then should you

48
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,310
build a chat board it reduces the

49
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,500
proximity between customers and

50
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,720
businesses these days we are noticing a

51
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,520
trend that business are trying to get as

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,209
close as possible using technology an

53
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,360
example of this would be that kya is

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,940
using the Apple watch a device that is

55
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,780
on your risk to surface our trip

56
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,420
information and you can also ask Alexa

57
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,850
to order an uber now and you can say

58
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,920
something like Alexa a scoobert to

59
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,680
request an uberx to Amazon echo and it

60
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,650
does this task that is under this

61
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,900
constraint is really really well and of

62
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,430
course there's some you can also order a

63
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,670
pizza you can all a Domino's Pizza with

64
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,850
facebook Messenger and you know so today

65
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,739
businesses are competing on customer

66
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,230
attention span over other businesses so

67
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,630
comScore found out that the average

68
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,500
Americans devote half the app time to a

69
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,130
single app and on a separate study you

70
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,570
have Manasseh buret study by business

71
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,489
intelligence you have messaging app

72
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,670
surpassing social networks in terms of

73
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,160
active users and chat BOTS works as

74
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,049
customers already in the messaging

75
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,239
applications themselves so for you guys

76
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,370
who a lot of you guys might be using

77
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,110
something like Facebook Messenger or

78
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,799
you're using cake you already have the

79
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,500
app on and now it's encroaching into

80
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,079
your personal space so which is not so

81
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,110
good but also good for businesses chat

82
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,489
BOTS are yet another way to get to your

83
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,230
customers so today we are going to talk

84
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,600
about three things and instead of me

85
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,010
telling you how to code a facebook

86
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,320
Messenger app or kik messenger or you

87
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,690
know using Skype I'm gonna tell you my

88
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,210
experience in going through coding a

89
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,360
chat bot and number one I'm gonna tell

90
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,280
you how is it like honest

91
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,460
the receiving messaging from the chat

92
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,860
services meaning how to integrate with

93
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,800
chat services and then also talking

94
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,840
about how every chat services have a

95
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,990
slightly differing API so how to exploit

96
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,450
it and how to learn more about it second

97
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,030
is to comprehend the users input you

98
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,320
need to figure out what the user is

99
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,450
trying what the intention is and number

100
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,919
three is responding to the user so first

101
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,040
is to figure out the integration part

102
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,320
your go-to thing is to read the

103
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,980
documentation which tend to you know be

104
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,710
a bit confusing sometimes what I did is

105
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,650
to start by using request actually

106
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,610
request bin so if you go to this URL

107
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,590
that's how I learned how to start doing

108
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,770
slacks outgoing web hook and you can see

109
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,490
that in slack you have this thing where

110
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,530
you can feel in an URL if you go to

111
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,090
request being you just click you

112
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,910
generate a new session you will be able

113
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,910
to fill it in and if you do a chat like

114
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,890
Jas come fascia is really cool which we

115
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,919
all know is true you'll be able to see

116
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,150
that what request being actually get

117
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,160
from from slack and in this case you'll

118
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,440
be able to build your app this way bit

119
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,270
by bit because now you understand what

120
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,890
are the inputs and what is the potential

121
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,410
output that you have to do and most of

122
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,120
the documentation they stress a lot on

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,630
what is what you should send the server

124
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,400
it doesn't stress enough what you're

125
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,050
receiving from the server so you don't

126
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,510
get to see what exactly is the server

127
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,130
sending to you and this is this is a

128
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,380
great way and the next example is a

129
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,410
Facebook messengers web who same you can

130
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,520
get to the callback URL and you can see

131
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,820
that again I feel in the request being

132
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,490
and it will initiate a subscription and

133
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,060
in this case you see that it gets

134
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,250
there's a hop challenge and then there's

135
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,289
a hot mode and that's how you you learn

136
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:34,140
their API and when you do a send on

137
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,539
hello how are you doing today you see

138
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:39,310
that right at the bottom it's a little

139
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,950
small but you can see the

140
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,920
you you get the Java the JSON payload

141
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,440
that sends back and you format it nicely

142
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,780
you'll see you get the sender you got

143
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,630
the recipient the times them and also

144
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,500
the text of course so next I'm going to

145
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,140
show you how do you do local development

146
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,750
with using local tano and no demon and

147
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,960
so local tano is lets you test and

148
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,610
develop things locally and the

149
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,620
exposes.the your IP address actually

150
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,110
does a reverse proxy kind of thing and a

151
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,510
last Facebook to be able to reach you

152
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,130
through a public IP address and in this

153
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,440
case you also can use no daemon which

154
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,750
I'm not sure if you familiar this but it

155
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,910
just restarts each time you change and

156
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,410
we're going to do a live demo which I'm

157
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:37,070
very nervous about so here goes nothing

158
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:46,720
and so

159
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,650
so we start already installed this local

160
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:58,610
tunnel so I have I have my app running

161
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,440
so I'm going to close in and I rerun my

162
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,510
app and so this is actually the web hope

163
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,230
that is going to be that connecting let

164
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,620
me get my orientation right little

165
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,220
confused with this so in this case if

166
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,470
you are if you want to follow you can

167
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,580
download this demo that I will give the

168
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,730
link to later and then I will use local

169
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,850
tunnel to expose this Airport eight nine

170
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:43,020
five five I'm going to copy this URL

171
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,900
make sure it works

172
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,080
so this is already an external URL that

173
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,510
Facebook can reach is already got HTTPS

174
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,320
and it will hit my local computer in

175
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,130
this case you go to your web hook

176
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,990
subscription if you have familiar

177
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,410
fixboot

178
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,670
as how you can change the URL here and

179
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:15,370
you change the URL right here to this

180
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:22,600
new one and my verify token is 2016 to

181
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,650
verify and safe and so after which you

182
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:33,250
can go here and you can say hi and you

183
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,030
should be able to get deeper information

184
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:42,940
that is here so you can also do things

185
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,620
like hello and I wrote this to call

186
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,290
wrong car so that it can show you things

187
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,150
like the your typing and then you can

188
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,360
send Chiefs as well so for more

189
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,650
information you can check out the source

190
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,600
code that I have so I'm showing you is

191
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,090
how you can do debugging and then the

192
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,680
next is to comprehend the users input

193
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,060
and let's start by imagining that we are

194
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,800
going to have a doctor's application

195
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,660
where you do like a book and appointment

196
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,330
tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. and using this

197
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,910
example you first have to discover what

198
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,370
the intent is in our app we are going to

199
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,140
have two main functions one it's going

200
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,170
to be get appointments and the other one

201
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,240
being book appointments where it accepts

202
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,270
a date and time so how you figure get

203
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,310
appointment sorry how do you figure out

204
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,620
book and appointment as an intention and

205
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,050
you know the simplest way is really just

206
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,400
to use red X right so incredibly naive

207
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,370
but works really well so you could try a

208
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,960
book an appointment tomorrow at 4:00

209
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,410
p.m. that works that's the red X but

210
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,580
what if you want to do a like book

211
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,790
appointment and you know you do you need

212
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,320
to change your red X to be more flexible

213
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,240
and what if people want

214
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,520
an appointment that's fine too this red

215
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,620
X book and what about people wanting

216
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,990
reserved my appointment you can keep

217
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,660
adding reg access and through this you

218
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,000
are determining the intention of the

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,390
user so I'm just gonna skip through this

220
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,279
and you can so now that you determine

221
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,920
the intention of the user which is

222
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,020
booked an appointment tomorrow at 4:00

223
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,540
p.m. you know that we need to use booked

224
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,790
appointment where for that date and a

225
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,560
time and so now it's really about

226
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,800
extracting out tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. so

227
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,420
how do we get the parameter tomorrow at

228
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,190
4:00 p.m. and reg X isn't very

229
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,510
straightforward anymore because there's

230
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,089
you can people can say something like a

231
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:51,260
book an appointment next Saturday at 3

232
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,560
p.m. and you it you know things get

233
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,050
really complicated so that there's a

234
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,300
package for that and you can use simple

235
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:06,050
NLP tools ok and there is this component

236
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,440
of NLP if you guys are familiar with it

237
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,060
it's called the parts of speech tagger

238
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,149
and some people use Python and there is

239
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,070
this really good library called NLT Kay

240
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,760
in Python but in order GS we that there

241
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,890
is a few libraries like natural and one

242
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,959
of the easier to use one I found was an

243
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,480
RP compromise which itself is a

244
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,070
compromise because it doesn't give the

245
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,220
full set of NLP tools for you to it's

246
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,600
kind of like good enough is good enough

247
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,649
thing and a parts of speech tagger is a

248
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:39,500
piece of software that reads the text

249
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
and the science parts of speech to each

250
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,240
word and other tokens based on both its

251
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,970
definition its context that is its

252
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,029
relationship with Jason and related was

253
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:53,839
in a phrase sentence or paragraph so it

254
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,910
sounds a little complicated so I'm going

255
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,709
to break it down for you in like

256
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,630
preschool English and we shall start a

257
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,020
phrase like I have a pen and I have a

258
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,950
pen it's a really popular song and you

259
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,529
can pass iron I have a pen with NLP

260
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,990
compromise and this is how you do it you

261
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,089
can you have to require the NLP comp

262
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:16,889
package I made a mistake there is

263
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,749
actually enough IDI underscore

264
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:21,569
compromise get a sentence and you can

265
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,550
pass through the terms and you can log

266
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,279
out to see what kind of term it is and

267
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:33,329
the first you get I I is a pro now so

268
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:36,329
that's not what we want

269
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:39,379
you get half which is an infinitive

270
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,480
infinitive vote and you get earth which

271
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,079
is an article and already determiner and

272
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,839
also a pen so in this case you you get

273
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,569
to see like the first one is a pro now

274
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:56,639
the second one is a verb then an article

275
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,769
then they a now so you kind of get the

276
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,019
gist of it and what if we want to push

277
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,819
it even more and we want to get things

278
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:07,589
like in emoji and we have a library for

279
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:10,470
that too and it's all in MPM and so

280
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:16,800
again i have an apple and an apple is

281
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,110
not something that is supported by an LP

282
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,420
compromise so you get a little question

283
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,999
mark and so when it couldn't find

284
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,670
anything that seems to be representable

285
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,429
in this little database it will assign a

286
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:30,749
question mark because it doesn't know

287
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:32,970
what to do so we passed it on to an

288
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,860
emoji tagger instead and what there is a

289
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,939
library called game OG I think it might

290
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:46,589
be github emoji not really sure so what

291
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,209
it does is it passed the Unicode correct

292
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,059
us if you pass in an apple it tells you

293
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,079
the description being a rate Apple right

294
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:00,660
and then you can you can then do complex

295
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,999
things like detecting what exactly the

296
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:07,679
emoji means and so going to do live demo

297
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:19,520
again probably bad idea

298
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:28,410
so if you type I have a pan in here it's

299
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,120
going to give you you have a pen

300
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:42,010
so that's right and what about in emoji

301
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,720
so so I say I have an apple and it tells

302
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,810
me that you have a great apple so there

303
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,880
are a few things to notice here firstly

304
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,000
it knows that it is already PO and it's

305
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,930
not a great apple because the the NLP

306
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,680
compromise has is able to detect what

307
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,660
sort of article should follow a soup

308
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,690
procedure now and if you try things like

309
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,300
if you make mistakes that you decide to

310
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:20,310
choose I have a cow it's able to fix it

311
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,200
for you by saying that you have an ox

312
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,420
because their stocks emoji and so what

313
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,670
you can do a lot of things by this

314
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,470
because you're you're reading the user

315
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,150
input and they tell me what the user is

316
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,500
trying to tell you including things like

317
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,780
emoji and there's a lot of passing

318
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:46,680
involved but it works okay so now for

319
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,200
the real thing right so initial passing

320
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,060
we do any show pass with an LP

321
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,860
compromise and we pass book an

322
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,770
appointment tomorrow at 4 p.m. and this

323
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,270
is how it's going to be like it's good I

324
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,760
bought it mistakenly thought that it

325
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,860
wasn't now because book is also it now

326
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,860
it's not really smart but a book and

327
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,720
appointment

328
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,510
and notice that it grabs you tomorrow at

329
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,280
4 p.m. as a complete as part of an item

330
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,459
as as a term right so in this case you

331
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,280
see that the text is tomorrow at 4 p.m.

332
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,410
and the tech is date unfortunately NOP

333
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,810
compromise isn't smart enough to figure

334
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,000
out things like what sort of data so it

335
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,770
couldn't get the year couldn't guess the

336
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,830
month and the day but not to worry we

337
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,750
have another package for it and you can

338
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,410
pass through this call a true chrono

339
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,020
note and you'll be able to receive

340
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,970
tomorrow at 4 p.m. and you will get the

341
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,160
date and the time

342
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,320
and then you can even do with more

343
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,730
interesting things that figure out the

344
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,010
date and time based on between something

345
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,530
to something so you can say February

346
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,710
23rd too much second and you'll be able

347
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,680
to get to different data and time so

348
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,450
with this you can complete your doctor's

349
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:18,920
appointment app and so can do much more

350
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,490
complicated things like book and

351
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:40,700
appointment for next Sunday 4:00 p.m. so

352
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,620
it will tell you this actually tells you

353
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,360
the day so if he goes that next Sunday

354
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,450
is actually referring to November 27th

355
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,090
and I use moment to format it with the

356
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:57,410
time zone okay so so the next is about

357
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,290
responding to the user and the general

358
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,400
rules of thumb is that you need to be

359
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,060
succinct and you need to be friendly

360
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,610
respect the medium which is in this case

361
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,050
in my previous case was Facebook and

362
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,790
also you need to figure out how to

363
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,630
handle the arrows if there are any and

364
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,970
try to give the simplest and clearest

365
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,220
answers are the best for the user and

366
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,920
that's because the mobile messaging are

367
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,720
typically limited by space and you

368
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,490
wouldn't want to return a whole bunch of

369
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,050
text and they had to scroll and scroll

370
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,960
to figure out where they have to read

371
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,120
the shorter the ball responses are the

372
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,280
better and remember the emojis are also

373
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,160
valid responses so if you could use

374
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,020
things like you're thinking use things a

375
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,130
take a few more personal to the user and

376
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,080
at the same time it saves a lot of space

377
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,720
as well so the next is to be friendly

378
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,020
use pronouns like I on you so so

379
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,870
disclaimer first this might work for

380
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,880
things like Facebook messenger it might

381
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,290
work for kick it might not necessarily

382
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,600
work for slap if you want things to be

383
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,770
more formal and so if you most of the

384
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,289
boss in

385
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:11,090
Facebook if you tried chatting with them

386
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,760
when you say hi they will say back hi to

387
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,220
you sometimes they wave back at you and

388
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,830
it's okay to say things like you don't

389
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,080
understand the input or you know you can

390
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,820
say sorry I don't understand and you

391
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,039
give them a suggestion of what sort of

392
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,710
inputs you can give and try to use

393
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,980
active instead of passive voice for

394
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,389
example your flight has been booked is

395
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:34,269
not as good as I booked your flight

396
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:38,870
because the reason being chat in

397
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,090
facebook is a lot more personal so

398
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,850
people that is the way people talk and

399
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,340
lastly you know be humble so that people

400
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,179
won't get frustrated and some of this

401
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,730
humans are smart enough to figure out

402
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,159
the parameters it needs to fit the chat

403
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,159
bot interface and if you try to build

404
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,679
something there is entirely conversation

405
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:03,080
in this case if you check out some of

406
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,880
the apps you can actually do a really

407
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,010
conversational things like say hi how do

408
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,110
you do and is able to respond fine thank

409
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,809
you you effectively you put the bow of

410
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,210
your app incredibly high because now

411
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,510
your your users are thinking that wow

412
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,669
this is a really small app so I can chat

413
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,370
with it so if you if you just make it

414
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,669
you manage expectation and you set it to

415
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:28,789
be straightforward whereby you just give

416
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,090
a very structured command it helps so

417
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,049
it's okay and respect the medium so

418
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:38,840
notice what sort of responses there can

419
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,580
be for example facebook Messenger

420
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,620
supports text emoji locations and

421
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,570
buttons and you can format things using

422
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,850
under stall screen and you can get

423
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,570
sentences so try to make sure you use

424
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,570
things don't make don't make the text

425
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,679
too long and you cannot be able to the

426
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:02,510
user have to scroll and that wouldn't be

427
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,320
too nice and if you look at slack this

428
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,789
is G fie and slit allows you to find

429
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:13,399
different gifs that you can share on

430
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,769
your enterprise chat board something

431
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:18,080
that my company my co-workers and I do a

432
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,179
lot and read the respective

433
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:21,110
documentation is

434
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,910
what sort of things are available so for

435
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,160
slack it has this little button where

436
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,480
you can click view more and you'll

437
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,270
refresh things that are there and so

438
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,090
this does not apply to say the Skype

439
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,340
using the face and Skype has something

440
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,980
that is similar but it's not quite the

441
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,910
same as this so next is to respect the

442
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,240
medium poncho actually has a send

443
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,880
location button so users can tap on it

444
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,190
to send a location and poncho is a

445
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,679
weather an able app so it can tell you

446
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,120
every single day whether you need to

447
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,429
wear poncho where you need to bring an

448
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:00,380
umbrella and stuff and for whip USG we

449
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,450
use generic templates and facebook

450
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,850
Messenger so in this case you can see

451
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,260
that there are buttons where you can

452
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,540
click and this is entirely only it's

453
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,520
something that is very Facebook specific

454
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,710
and it's really trying to exploit the

455
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:20,480
API and you can use ron-karr which is an

456
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,540
app that I wrote this is a library that

457
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,000
I wrote so what it does is it allows you

458
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,340
to write like send text and it gives you

459
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,360
the ellipses and you can't wait for

460
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,740
3,000 milliseconds to send the next one

461
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,510
and you can do simple things like

462
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,429
sending imagers there are a lot of

463
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:39,190
libraries out there and the odd differ

464
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,160
in the expressivity of the API and I

465
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,919
want to do something like being able to

466
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,080
do something like what a to express what

467
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,720
a human could have done and lastly is to

468
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,100
handle errors so you know we need to

469
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,980
make sure that so always test for

470
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,250
negative scenarios so more often than

471
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,620
not we we always expect that the API

472
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,510
that we are connecting to will always

473
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,740
give a positive result

474
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,270
make sure you have another negative use

475
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,250
case as well so that's so I'm going to

476
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,870
go through like the the problems I faced

477
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,110
when building blocks choosing what to

478
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,950
view is actually pretty hard your

479
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,630
business functions can be represented in

480
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,390
so many ways of the raw and not every

481
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,580
part of the business makes sense to

482
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,070
develop into a chatbot and if the more

483
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,530
so the next is you are encroaching the

484
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,020
personal space such as phase

485
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,730
messenger meaning that their friends are

486
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,620
there the last thing you ever want to do

487
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,200
is you you tell them more than their

488
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,090
friends tell them and they will just

489
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,460
delete your app and if you're more

490
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,410
spammy than the other BOTS people won't

491
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,450
like it too and if you try to become

492
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,760
more conversation or just make sure that

493
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,980
there are real human beings they are

494
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,230
also using the messaging app they try

495
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,300
and chat with their friends so if you

496
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,100
were to do that you set the bar very

497
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,310
high and lastly every chat messenger

498
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,220
messaging system is a medium with

499
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,810
special characteristic hence they have

500
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,560
different api's and if you support more

501
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,030
than one chat system you might want to

502
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,460
build things like micro services to

503
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,460
connect to and so instead of having one

504
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,650
app there just saw facebook Messenger

505
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,330
you have a facebook messenger interface

506
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,550
you have a pic messenger in the face

507
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,890
slight interface and they all connect to

508
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,340
a central micro service that is able to

509
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,540
figure out the responses there is

510
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:37,350
appropriate so just to touch on

511
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,320
conversation and structure text for

512
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,060
conversational text is less predictable

513
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,570
and potentially it's more open-ended and

514
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,490
it requires complex rules based system

515
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,710
or machine learning capabilities so my

516
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,540
recommendation is that if you cannot do

517
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,760
that you should not try to do that

518
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,200
there's this app that is really well

519
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,540
done called human in Jesse's story and

520
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,610
if you can see the dialogue you know it

521
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,110
tries to be very conversational I'm the

522
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,060
blue by the way I have not the de crayon

523
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,450
and if you you can say hey Jesse and is

524
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,730
is able to pull off a pretty decent

525
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,400
conversation with you and I realized

526
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,280
that it's is one of those it's like a

527
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,110
very it's like a little go

528
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,720
so I reply back with what I think a

529
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,660
little girl would have replied okay so

530
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,750
on on that note structured text is more

531
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,990
predictable hence it's is with limited

532
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,120
functionality but you get to control a

533
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,860
lot more so we built SG is an example of

534
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,920
a structure chat bot so it's built by me

535
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,220
and the web us G API and you can try

536
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,500
asking about upcoming events and he only

537
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,640
tells you that

538
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,230
and he also tells you things like you

539
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,510
can check the latest repository it tells

540
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,030
you about podcast by the specific things

541
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,620
then it knows what to do

542
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,570
it doesn't do more than more than just

543
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,440
three functions essentially so lastly

544
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,940
sometimes coding by yourself is not

545
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,190
necessarily the right solution depending

546
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,400
on the scope sometimes you might find
