all right so hello everyone I'm Kevin

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,120
O'Neill and I'm a visually impaired

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,730
front-end developer so in this talk I

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,670
wanted to go over some of the challenges

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,860
and some of the solutions that I came up

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,430
with during my five years of working in

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,820
the house working as a web developer and

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,399
so as I mentioned my name is Kevin no no

18
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,260
this is my twitter handle sorry it's a

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,840
little bit strange that's two

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,680
underscores twice so if you have any

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,130
questions or any suggestions please send

22
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:16,479
me a message that'll be great so I

23
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,930
worked at fast retailing it's a large

24
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,010
apparel company and based in Japan and

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,680
if you've been to Japan before you've

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,490
probably noticed a brand unique glow and

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,490
we have some stores in the US as well so

28
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,619
if you happen to come across any of

29
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,200
those stores please do check out some of

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,710
the items that we have for sale I'm

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,170
actually wearing one of them right now

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:51,490
so all right so one thing I wanted to

33
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:57,700
say was six years ago I was at

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,790
university and I had a lot of self

35
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,100
self-doubt and so for example I kind of

36
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,429
felt like perhaps I wasn't good enough

37
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,730
to kind of like be a developer or to

38
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,000
kind of like find a job just because of

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,769
some of the experiences that I went

40
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:21,459
through and what I wanted to say like

41
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,770
what this presentation is

42
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,570
please don't fall into that trap it's

43
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,820
easy to get to get discouraged and to

44
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,760
kind of not try to push yourself and

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,170
perhaps a lot of things can cause that I

46
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,600
wanted to ask everybody if you happen to

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,120
know somebody else who is able to

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,020
challenge or has a lot of other

49
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,460
difficulties or challenges please share

50
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:55,510
this story with them so right here I'm

51
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,770
just going to go through some of the

52
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,390
conditions that I have these are

53
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,630
actually there's three of them in total

54
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,760
and this is what I was born with

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,850
there is no corrective surgery for them

56
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,970
at this time so it's something that I'm

57
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,760
gonna have to just be stuck with until

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,480
there is something like that so the

59
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,480
first one is nystagmus which is a vision

60
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,850
condition in which makes the eyes eye

61
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,770
Federative uncontrolled movements so

62
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,630
sometimes like if you if you look at me

63
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,610
like I'm I don't probably go like in

64
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,100
random places or they'll be stuck in one

65
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,370
other complete different direction so

66
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,730
there's that the second one is myopia

67
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,310
which is nearsightedness and this is I

68
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,290
have quite of an extreme version of

69
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,080
nearsightedness that makes it quite

70
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,209
difficult thankfully I have these

71
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,970
glasses here that can extend my vision

72
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,260
quite a bit but mostly it's for if I'm

73
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,900
out and about or outside unfortunately

74
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,590
when it comes to like using a computer

75
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,040
screen or working I'm so used to not

76
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,580
having them on you don't tend to work

77
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,440
really well for those situations and the

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,230
last one I actually have difficult even

79
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,900
still pronouncing it maybe it's a blue

80
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,830
man phobia and it's it's also known as

81
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,260
like the lazy eye so those are the three

82
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,320
things that I have and we can actually

83
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,840
simulate this a little bit so I'm gonna

84
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,370
take off my glasses right now

85
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,570
and if you actually extend take out one

86
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,970
of your arms and extend it beyond that

87
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,340
point I can barely I can actually barely

88
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,380
see it's extremely burly if I'm looking

89
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,250
out right now I can it's all just a big

90
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,520
blob or a big blur and the second part

91
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,490
that my condition is that if you take

92
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,110
one hand and you place it over your eye

93
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,270
that's actually the field of vision that

94
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,860
I have like entirely so it's very narrow

95
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:20,710
and cut in half basically so about let's

96
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,200
say almost a year ago I ran into this

97
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,440
article by the Pew Research Center and I

98
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,780
found it pretty shocking and sad and as

99
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,150
you can see in the headline there's

100
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,570
quite a large digital divide between

101
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,510
people with disabilities or challenges

102
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,669
and and if you haven't heard of the term

103
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,260
like digital divide I'm sure you have

104
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,650
it's the gap between the people who have

105
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,680
access to technology or the internet and

106
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,200
those who don't so what I hope with this

107
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,590
presentation is in a way to close that

108
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,330
gap and I'll come back to this later on

109
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,720
a later point how I hope to achieve this

110
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,120
in the near future so this is one of the

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,810
this is the quote from the article that

112
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,430
kind of stood out for me

113
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,979
disabled Americans are about three times

114
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,139
as likely as those with a disability to

115
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:29,200
say they never go online 22% versus 8%

116
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,020
according to a Pew Research Center

117
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,990
survey conducted in the fall of 2016 so

118
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:42,300
that's quite a big gap

119
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,740
and so I'm gonna start with my story

120
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,710
here so I graduated from Cal State San

121
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,300
Marcos it's about a maybe a 25 20 25

122
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,520
minute drive from here actually and I

123
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,050
scheduled in December of 2012 and I

124
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,520
graduated with Visual and Performing

125
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,490
Arts

126
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,930
Technology degree so this is basically

127
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,789
like a graphic digital graphic design

128
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:16,840
and it took me about a year to find a

129
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,660
full-time job and part of this is

130
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,520
because like as you know when you're

131
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,740
trying to find your first job it can be

132
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,199
really really difficult just because

133
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,930
you're trying to stand out from other

134
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,229
applicants and getting your first job is

135
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:34,910
always the most difficult thing but in

136
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,470
my case since I was I'm raised in

137
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,880
Southern California I have these eye

138
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,130
conditions I am not legally allowed to

139
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,840
drive so often when I had an interview

140
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
and the employer might be asking

141
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,520
reasonably so of course like how would

142
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,419
you get to work and most of the times I

143
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,409
couldn't figure out like how to answer

144
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:08,570
that question and so I started looking

145
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,630
for places that would have a better

146
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,190
public transportation system something

147
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,940
like yeah

148
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,349
maybe in New York City or perhaps like

149
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:25,460
Portland Seattle just anything that

150
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,199
could kind of help me get to work on

151
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,280
Simon in during this timeframe I

152
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,959
actually got in contact with someone via

153
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,339
LinkedIn and I ended up in Tokyo Japan

154
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:42,709
we're just crying big ya jump I'm not

155
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,060
going to get too much into like the

156
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,829
cultural differences in this

157
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,740
presentation unfortunately but here I'm

158
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,260
just going to talk about like a little

159
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,120
bit of

160
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,540
like what I found when I've been living

161
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,040
there this is a disclaimer some of the

162
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,360
points or advice that I'm gonna give out

163
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,890
in this presentation might be just a

164
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,529
little bit tailored to just what how

165
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,970
that Japanese job market is or how my

166
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,610
experiences have been so this part is

167
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,110
about some of the advice that I would

168
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,740
give to myself like five years ago six

169
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,680
years ago when I was looking for a job

170
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:34,070
and one of those things is that if you

171
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,960
have if you're a really challenged or

172
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:43,250
you want to yeah I need some help I was

173
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,600
able to make a take advantage of the

174
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,120
California Department state of rehab if

175
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,880
you are from another state I'm sure that

176
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,730
there's another similar branch or

177
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,950
division and there's a lot of

178
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,170
educational and vocational programs that

179
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:05,960
they give out and help anyone disability

180
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,490
so I wanted to give a shout out and

181
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,170
wanted to thank the California

182
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,339
Department rehab for making this

183
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:11,089
possible

184
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:12,620
because without them I wouldn't be

185
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,390
speaking here in front of all of you

186
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,360
another thing so when I was first my

187
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,880
first job in my second job hi I should

188
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,260
did not ask for any help for my employer

189
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,360
to make my working situation a lot

190
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
easier to become more efficient so I'm

191
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,580
gonna show like an example of this this

192
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,790
is basically my setup in my previous

193
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,470
company a friend of mine took this photo

194
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,600
just to illustrate like how close I have

195
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,620
to be to the screen and it was great cuz

196
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,330
this is just like a monitor arm that

197
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,240
just attaches to your desk so this way I

198
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,400
can move around the monitor freely if I

199
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,300
need to and this is part of like why

200
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,160
I think it's important if you work like

201
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,260
for a good employer or someone that

202
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,430
really cares about you

203
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,899
they're willing to try to help you be a

204
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,850
lot more comfortable or be more

205
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,680
efficient at your job

206
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,480
and this is what allowed me to do that

207
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,870
so I wanted to thank my previous

208
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,880
employer my current employer for making

209
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,930
that happen

210
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:32,269
hopefully that starts happening a lot

211
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:33,920
more and that was just like one of the

212
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,760
most amazing things for me being able to

213
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,480
take advantage of that and now I want to

214
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,519
get into some of the tools that I was

215
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,990
able to use during my time as a

216
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:58,370
front-end developer and so my one of my

217
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,209
jobs

218
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:03,740
it was quite imperative to quite

219
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,200
important to keep the I say how

220
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,709
pixel-perfect designs so the designer

221
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,810
would of course I'm designed something

222
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,690
in Photoshop or illustrator and they

223
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,250
would send it to us the front-end

224
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,829
developer team and it needed to be like

225
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:21,890
pixel perfect like every pixel needed to

226
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,209
work or needed to be aligned in every in

227
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,010
a lot of browsers including Internet

228
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,170
Explorer so that was kind of tough

229
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,779
especially as someone who is nearsighted

230
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:44,000
and so with this part I wanted to tell

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,630
another story so it was quite late at

232
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:53,839
night maybe 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. and in

233
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,690
order to one of the designers would take

234
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,279
my web page that I was working on and

235
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,709
his design and he printed it out I'd

236
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:08,540
have no like physical media of this on

237
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,420
paper and wood came over to me and

238
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,730
started asking like hey this is how it

239
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,399
should actually look and he took started

240
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,899
taking out a ruler and kind of like

241
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,880
compared

242
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,730
how close like everything should be my

243
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,460
coworker right next to me actually said

244
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,910
hey so I have a better idea why don't

245
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,970
you just use this and this next slide is

246
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,800
a little bit like I heard your eyes a

247
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,280
bit so I'm going to just show it at

248
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,200
first for a couple of seconds and then

249
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,640
move back so that was great because it's

250
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,890
a little chrome extension that you can

251
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,760
just install and it will basically you

252
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,060
could set an image and it'll just lay it

253
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,220
on top of your website so you can kind

254
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,360
of like compare and see how close your

255
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,690
final web page is to design and not only

256
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,820
that but I was able to use it with some

257
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,490
of the accessibility tools that are

258
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,460
found in the Mac system preferences so

259
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,890
that was extremely helpful compared to

260
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,490
just dealing in the physical realm I

261
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,370
could just use the the great tools that

262
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,910
are already inside of the operating

263
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,660
system or Mac OS or Windows or whichever

264
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,410
one whichever OS you'd like to use and

265
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,920
that was like incredible so here's some

266
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,500
of the things that I like to set for

267
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:47,340
example and if you're using a Mac OS

268
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,680
then you can just go to the top left

269
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,790
there's the Apple icon you click on that

270
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,530
and go System Preferences and you click

271
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,600
on accessibility and the screen will pop

272
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,700
up and now there are different options

273
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,500
that you a lot of different options that

274
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,790
you can set and down here at the bottom

275
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,760
there's zoom command so there's two

276
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,580
different kinds of zooms that you can

277
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,380
use you can either have it set so it's

278
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,670
picture-in-picture as it's shown in here

279
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,320
and what that will do is it will create

280
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,010
a little frame inside of whenever you're

281
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,700
zooming in and there's the full screen

282
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,020
zoom which is doing that I actually

283
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,610
really like to use

284
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,029
and that was part of the tools that I

285
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,519
was able to use to help me out a lot

286
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,029
when I had to compare the designs with

287
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:43,809
the pixel-perfect extension and here's

288
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,350
some advanced options just in case so

289
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,089
it's yeah just as the arrow points on

290
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:55,959
the bottom right hand side and there's a

291
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,179
lot of other settings that I go through

292
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:00,939
and every time I set up a new computer I

293
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:04,170
make sure that all of these are set or

294
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,879
hopefully I can kind of sync them up in

295
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,350
a way so for example like in the chrome

296
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,089
settings which is what I usually use for

297
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,019
development

298
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,649
I sent the font size too large just

299
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,779
because it's a lot more helpful so I can

300
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,949
see and they even have page zooms that

301
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,540
you can adjust and see whatever you want

302
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,999
we can we're helpful and okay so we're

303
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,369
developers and we spend a lot of time in

304
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:37,389
editors and I've jumped around through a

305
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:41,189
bunch of different editors and so far

306
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:45,939
although I use Visual Studio code all

307
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,179
the time I love that I love that editor

308
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:49,959
a lot

309
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,540
I found the extensibility in Adam to be

310
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,519
really really really helpful I'm not

311
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,649
showing a previous slide but there's

312
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:02,819
lots of great editors that you could

313
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:05,529
make very extremely customizable and

314
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:10,419
here these are my basic settings and you

315
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:12,339
can ignore the bottom or the bottom up

316
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,649
bottom parts of it but yeah I usually

317
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:19,240
send everything to 22 or 24 size fonts

318
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,600
even for the integrated terminal and a

319
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,419
lot of different other applications just

320
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,490
because that's what I'm used to but

321
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,909
again everybody has their own challenges

322
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:33,429
and difficulties so it might be higher

323
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:38,500
might be lower and this is what it looks

324
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,870
like when I am editing

325
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:51,670
any my code okay so as I mentioned

326
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,679
earlier Adam is really great at

327
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,450
extending extending the user interface

328
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,390
and but I really hope to do in the

329
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:07,360
future is perhaps make a theme that for

330
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,750
example this city lights UI seeing that

331
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,840
can help perhaps people who have my

332
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,990
condition or other Pete other people who

333
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,850
are a really challenged and find ways to

334
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,590
make their time working a lot easier the

335
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:28,510
reason why I really like this theme is

336
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,320
because it puts the search right in the

337
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,020
front and pretty much the center of the

338
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,500
screen and you can kind of adjust it to

339
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,330
make it either the text bigger or

340
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,890
smaller this is what I hope I haven't

341
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,230
found a way to do it in Visual Studio

342
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,050
code yet but if you do happen to know

343
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,650
something like to make the search a lot

344
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,500
easier please please please do let me

345
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,370
know and then I can share that ok so

346
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,070
here's another thing that I found when

347
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,610
I've been working for about 5 years now

348
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,960
sometimes as we all do we need help with

349
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,640
what we're doing I need help with a

350
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,929
particular problem so I'll go to a

351
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:23,800
co-worker the thing is that when because

352
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,960
of my nearsightedness there's either two

353
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,890
options that we generally have or at

354
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,550
least that I first thought of is either

355
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,440
I get I have to get really close to

356
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,830
their screen or they would have to kind

357
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,040
of adjust their settings or something

358
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,679
like using the command or n+ tool to

359
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,710
kind of just like see zoom in the screen

360
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,990
but there is like a better way that I

361
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,710
found to do this and instead of

362
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,260
my coworker having to reset their

363
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,020
settings or go through their keyboard

364
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,300
shortcuts again and reset their

365
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,690
environments I actually found yes live

366
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,640
share to be extremely helpful for this

367
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,650
and Adam has teletype as well I haven't

368
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,420
been able to use it yet but I'm gonna

369
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,790
give it a try

370
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,160
soon and so these tools are actually

371
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,160
really helpful for me a lot perhaps at

372
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,800
first they were intended to of course be

373
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,690
more of like um maybe we're both if

374
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,070
you're working remotely with other

375
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,020
co-workers to kind of like do pair

376
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,210
programming but this these tools are

377
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,590
extremely helpful and I'm very thankful

378
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,620
that they're around and it's very easy

379
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:51,630
to get started on the menus them so what

380
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,500
can we do what can we all do to kind of

381
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:03,930
make accessibility better or make

382
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,140
improvements or start on these so this

383
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,910

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,640
of months back just to learn more about

387
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,070

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,780
off a check out her je s coffee you talk

399
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,880
and workshops so at my previous company

400
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,510
I wanted we were quite a big team or

401
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,610
like quite a small team actually but

402
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,020
they're around 24 back-end developers

403
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,760
and two front-end developers including

404
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,130
me so I wanted to kind of show what

405
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,980
front-end development was like and so I

406
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,720
started these workshops these internal

407
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,520
workshops to kind of teach back-end

408
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,200
developers about front-end development

409
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,120
and I was I I found that they were they

410
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,570
found to be pretty successful and what I

411
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,710
wanted to do in the future is to start

412
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,310
an accessibility workshop perhaps here

413
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,580
back in the United States or even in

414
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,640
Japan to kind of encourage people to get

415
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:07,080
started and so that's about it for my

416
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,530
presentation thank you so much for

417
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,200
