00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:27,079
>> Lena Reinhard I'm specializing in marketing,
community care and project management in tech.

2
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:33,261
I'm committed to the Open Source project hoodie
and apatch key couch DB and co‑founder at

3
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:40,940
the neighborhoodie a software consulting company.
What you can see behind me is a acre in southern

4
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,699
Germany close to village where I grew up.
And this is where this talk begins, this achier

5
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:55,230
in southern Germany this land is cultivated
land, this is culture. The leg rich term culture

6
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,539
evolved in the mid‑15th century and meant
the tilling of land, it's about who cared

7
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:07,229
for which parts of land, who did the work
on it, and who brought in the harvest. There's

8
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,890
also a figtive sense of culture which leads
us to the main case and which we refer to

9
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:20,710
today. Our modern term culture is the expression
of the way we act and refers to community

10
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:27,799
or group which shares common experiences that
shape the way its members understand the world.

11
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,050
I work in the tech world, and I contribute
to Open Source. And I love what I do, because

12
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,930
I found amazing people there and great projects
which have become near and dear to me. Still,

13
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,070
the future of Open Source is in danger, this
is why, in this talk, I want us to take a

14
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,500
look at culture in the world of free, liberal
and Open Source software today, and to make

15
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,560
it a bit easier for both you and me, I'll
just refer oit as Open Source from now on.

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,890
Even if you're not contributing to Open Source
projects yourself, most of these topics are

17
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:06,119
applicable to general tech culture and human
interaction in general, today.

18
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,340
Technologywise Open Source is highly relevant,
mobile, social media, Cloud services and big

19
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,980
data, for very important technologies of our
time rely heavily on Open Source. Open Source

20
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:24,930
is also relevant for business, it contributes
450\hbillion Euros per year, only to the European

21
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:33,870
economy. So, things are going great in Open
Source, right. Let me show you one thing first.

22
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:43,040
The amazing people from geek feminism Wikk
‑‑ technologye Open Source software, gaming

23
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,909
and more. This is the number of sexist incidents
per year, starting in the year 2000. Today,

24
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:58,651
on September\h14, 2014, the number of sexist
incidents, only this year is 52. Although

25
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:03,739
this graphic does not only display incidents
in Open Source software it depicts one thing

26
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:09,799
clearly, a lot of things are going terribly
wrong in our communities and their culture.

27
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,950
And here's why. Often when you talk about
Open Source projects people quickly refer

28
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:23,590
to the community, and are very excited about
it. Let's take a closer look at communities.

29
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:30,010
Dianeal Harrelson an an authorpologyist did
research on the Fedora project, 75\hpercent

30
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:38,439
of the respondents to her questions felt that
the Fedorra project is a community. The community

31
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:47,700
is the project, and, without the community,
we're lost. But when we're talking about the

32
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,560
community, and even if we're appreciating
it, there's one essential point that we must

33
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,020
not miss.

34
00:03:53,020 --> 00:04:01,290
As Joseph Raz phrased it, if a culture is
decaying or if it's discripple fated against,

35
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,599
the options and opportunities open to it's
members will shrink. Community is not just

36
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,360
about building nice stuff and hanging around
with nice people and chat rooms mailing lists

37
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,790
or conferences like this one today. Every
troll, every sexist comment, every harassment

38
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:26,190
toward one single community member will directly
harm this person, the entire community, the

39
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,670
product that you're building, and finally
Open Source in general. It's values, it's

40
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:40,900
ideas,e and it's existence. One major deterministic
of culture is language. Mars climate or by

41
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:52,170
tore was launched by NASA in 1998 to study
the atmospheric changes on mars. It got lost

42
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,390
in space, it dissinty grated due to atmospheric
stresses.

43
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:03,230
What was the reason for this robot's death.
It was caused by human communication failure,

44
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:09,610
four pieces of software producing and expecting
data in different units to navigators in the

45
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,600
teams involved pointed out the issues but
the concerns had been dismissed what happened

46
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:25,100
to mars climate orbiter is described by Conway's
Law, a computer programmer,. Conway's Law

47
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:31,210
states that organizations which design systems
produce designs which are copies of their

48
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:38,680
communication structures. Open Source carries
Conway's Law to extremes, as a scientist phrased

49
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,660
it. In Open Source there's a hybridism of
dialogue and code where the dialogue is directly

50
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:51,790
embedded in the code. They called Open Source
a network of people and things that is constructed

51
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:58,240
through the materiallization of language.
In other words, all communications in an Open

52
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,090
Source project will have direct impact on
the product, like the software that you're

53
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,530
building. All communications, no matter if
there are any, if there are none, if they're

54
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:16,261
peaceful or violent. I want to show you part
of the endangered languages project. Every

55
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:27,950
dot represents over 3,000 languages that are
currently becoming extinct. If a few of the

56
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,120
languages disappear large parts of the world's
population could still talk, so why should

57
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,710
we care if languages are lost? Let me ask
you two things first, who of you has ever

58
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:46,940
contributed to a free liberal or Open Source
project? Oh, that's plenty. And who of you

59
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,270
is a programmer or has ever done anything
related programming like editing a bit of

60
00:06:51,270 --> 00:07:01,170
HTML or CSS? Okay. Huge overlaps, I see that.
As people who can deal with programming languages,

61
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:07,410
you know that one of the core functionalities
is that language shapes reality. One change

62
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,700
in an expression in the source code of an
application can affect everything. And, break

63
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,419
everything, I guess so much of you have heard
of that.

64
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:21,470
Language is an essential part of our culture
and it shapes the way we express ourselves,

65
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,730
and this is why when one language disappears
into oblivion we are all diminished. Thus,

66
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,760
silencing people and their voices and Open
Source destables and endangers each and every

67
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,860
one of us. We in each source have to stop
silencing people when they speak out about

68
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:45,440
threats, mobbing, sexism and other topics
that show our broken culture. Open Source

69
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,650
is the materialtion of language and our community
culture influence every one of us. This is

70
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,961
why we have to take even more care of the
culture in Open Source communities. Because

71
00:07:55,961 --> 00:08:02,220
the future of Open Source will be mainly determined
its culture. \h‑‑ by its culture. Let's

72
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,130
see what other aspects we have to care for
in our communities and have a short excursion

73
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:15,410
to biology. As Charles Elton, an ecologist
argued simple, non‑diverse communities are

74
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:22,000
more easily upset than richer ones, that is
they're more vulnerable. And biology there's

75
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,580
a special research field for this topic, and
part of it is the so‑called stability diversity

76
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:33,720
hypothesis. In short, this hypothesis states
that the more diverse a community is, the

77
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:40,190
more stable and productive it is. Great example
for space, which is diverse by default are

78
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:48,340
rain forests. Typically, they posess a great
deal of species diversity. Around 40‑75\hpercent

79
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:53,150
of all biotic species are native to the rain
forests.

80
00:08:53,150 --> 00:09:00,110
Same goes with Coral reefs, they occupy less
than 0.1\hpercent of the world's ocean service,

81
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:09,320
that is around the size of France, yet they
provide a home for 25 of all marine species.

82
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,510
Diversity means variety and dissimilarity.
It is a state and process of involving people

83
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:21,660
who are different from each other in to a
group and aims to create an inclusive culture.

84
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,810
Diversity in natural setting, usually nothing
we have to impresent or fix, diversity is

85
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,780
the default. In artificial settings like Open
Source communities are, we have to cake care

86
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:38,420
for diversity ourselves. And first and over
all, because I did vsty is just the right

87
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:45,090
thing to do. As various studies show I did
vsty also enables us to solve complex problems

88
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:52,010
better and faster, be more creative and stimulated
through persistent exposure to minority perspective,

89
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:59,360
make better decisions and generate more innovation
this means if a community is not diverse,

90
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:08,450
it's broken. Diversity includes, age, ability,
ethnicity, social economic class, personal

91
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:15,280
background, gender and far more. Still, people
do not fit into single boxes, all of us fall

92
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,360
into a variety of dimensions, every one of
us has had a different life experience and

93
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,800
perceives the world differently, thus, we
need to take care as well about the intersections

94
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:36,330
of these groups. Let's take a look at some
examples. According to the 2013\h‑‑ 89\hpercent

95
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:43,150
of contributors to Open Source are men. 11\hpercent
are women. But this is not just about binary

96
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:49,780
gender system here. Currently, there's so
little space for LGBTIQ people in Open Source

97
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,520
that they are not even numbers. And it's worse
for people who are margin naturalized twice

98
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:01,820
or even more like, for example, women of color.
We also needy versety, and ethnicity, white

99
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,130
people are still forming the major mass in
Open Source, and we urgently need to get people

100
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:13,220
of all ethnicities into our project. We also
need to aim for diversity and skills and get

101
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,970
non‑coding people, like designers, writer,
people with organization skills and many more

102
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,670
on board. And we needy versety and ideas and
back beyonde grounds, the broader the amount

103
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:32,180
of ideas, backgrounds and experiences in our
communities, the further we can go. And we

104
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,850
need to aim for more. Working on diversity
in our communities should be a daily task

105
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:45,710
for every one of us. Or to phrase it like
Hartwig did recently on Twitter, when everyone

106
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:53,220
is making technology, the technology they
make will be for everybody. Community means

107
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,420
the appreciation of diversity and variety.

108
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,871
Community culture is our daily answer to the
question who, which people, and what, which

109
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:11,320
kind of contributions are being welcomed and
value in the our Open Source projects. Of

110
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,110
their strong values and goals behind Open
Source development which is the reason why

111
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:22,990
it exists and it is kept alive. Some of these
values are for example providing alternatives

112
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:29,380
for closed software enabling independence
and driving innovation, but there's one more

113
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:36,010
reason why Open Source software is built.
Software, in general, is built to perform

114
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,940
useful work, run a computer system, solve
problems, offer solutions, make things better

115
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:51,650
and more. But, make things better for whom?
Software is built for people. It's built for

116
00:12:51,650 --> 00:13:02,250
users, any software exists for being used
by someone. Of the number of developers in

117
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:08,460
this world is 18\hmillion people in total.
That already includes lobbyists who are coding

118
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:17,620
as a hobby, and 18\hmillion in total is in
comparison to the world population 0.26\hpercent.

119
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,680
Which means for every software developer out
there there are 399 people who have other

120
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,980
professions or just don't code. Now, let me
just give those 399 people a few more colors

121
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:34,530
to get them closer to reality, and there we
go. When we're talking about software, we

122
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:40,090
can't have this conversation without talking
about users. Software is built for them and

123
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:46,230
each of those 399 people have their very own
individual needs. And even our software developer

124
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:53,290
themselves will also be a software user. This
means that building software is an act of

125
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:59,010
representation (Audience: Yeah) many of us,
the people that are here today are very privileged

126
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,751
and our realities are very far from those
of millions of people on this planet. The

127
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:11,080
users of our software are very diverse group
and representation means responsibility. As

128
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,700
people who work on software, we have this
representation role to act according to. And

129
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:23,301
this is why non‑diverse communities working
on software can just not be justified. Only

130
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:31,279
moving beyond self referential mode enable
us to develop infratruck structure processes

131
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,450
and work that resonate with the broader population.

132
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:42,831
Misrep reseasonnation leads to serious issues,
one of these illustrated here by J Katz. The

133
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:48,910
JavaScript community loves "good enough" solutions
where good enough means horribly broken except

134
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:56,130
for my case. We already have representation
problem in our community itself, and it's

135
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,200
not getting better outside this community.
We have to fulfill our representation roles

136
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,050
properly in our communities, so we can finally
enable people to really trust the software

137
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:14,110
we're building. Of I want to give you an example
which depicts the trust issues by exposing

138
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:22,940
our user to far too often. The queer chorus,
the group group in Austin, Texas had a Facebook

139
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:28,820
group for its choir members, the president
of this chorus added two members of the group

140
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:35,160
to the Facebook group, what the president
didn't know, Facebook automatically told all

141
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,490
their friends that they were now members of
the queer chorus Facebook group. Thing is,

142
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:47,570
both those people had decided to not inform
their friends and families about being queer.

143
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:53,210
It was Facebook that did that for them. By
inadvertently exposing this information to

144
00:15:53,210 --> 00:16:01,300
their friends and families. Facebook made
a choice, instead of leaving it up to them.

145
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,170
Many more people have been stung by accidentally
revealing secrets on‑line that were easier

146
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:12,290
kept in the past. We need to keep examples
like this in mind and build software that

147
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:20,880
respects its users. The topic of proper user
representation is also linked with one of

148
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,830
the core values and goals of Open Source.
Freedom. Freedom is the idea of giving users

149
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:33,580
choices, power and control over the tools
they use. It's often stated that users are

150
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,680
enabled to see how the apps they use work,
check if they're secure and change them if

151
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:45,180
they want to. So, let me ask you another question.
And I'd ask you to raise your hands again.

152
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:52,339
Who, of you, has at least once read the source
code of your mail server that your e‑mail

153
00:16:52,339 --> 00:17:03,201
provider runs for you? Oh, one person\h‑‑
two\h‑‑ Kudos. So, we have to ask, how

154
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:08,920
many people actually can do this? How many
people have not only the interest, but also

155
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,020
the resources and knowledge to check the source
code of their software? How close do people's

156
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,960
actual realities can this idea of freedom
actually be. The idea of long‑term freedom

157
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,730
for users through Open Source is a great goal,
which we have to perceive. But we have to

158
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,420
take care to not make this a patron nicing
ideal that forgets about people's realities.

159
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:39,170
Instead, we have to build products that understand
people's needs and their capabilities and

160
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:44,280
we have to build them in diverse communities.
So we can make this ideal of freedom a thing

161
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,040
that is closer to people's realities than
it is now.

162
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:57,400
Another danger is currently facing is shown
by what happened to the Mayans, although they

163
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:06,730
were highly developed civilization was developed
suddenly disappeared around 800‑900 BC,

164
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:14,110
some archaeologist say that it was merely
a collapse of the ruling elites, this theory

165
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:19,020
can't be proven a hundred percent, but the
Maya show us that it's neither change nor

166
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:27,460
technology that threaten the integrity of
a culture. They had enough culture change

167
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:35,970
and technology, it wasn't that that threatened
them, it was power. The cruel face of domination.

168
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,770
If the needs of individuals in one culture
are continually suppressed social systems

169
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:48,070
can become unstable. One person in the Fedora
study project, which I mentioned before said,

170
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,880
"I used to believe this this project was a
community, but it seems more like a grouping

171
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:01,390
of various anarchists and monarchists who
think everyone else is like them." We rally

172
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,660
have to take care to avoid clicks and elites
that exclude community members and enforce

173
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:13,370
those unhealthy power structures which destabilize
our communities. We have to stop the marginalizelization

174
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:20,410
of people, the worshiping of heros, rock stores,
code unicorns and people that cannot be criticized

175
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:27,809
anymore because of their status. This leads
us to two other core concepts and goals of

176
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:35,010
Open Source which is decentralize and democracy.
Data shows that Open Source software is not

177
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:41,770
quite as democratic and de‑centralized as
it claims to be. Analysis shows of 5\hbillion

178
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:52,740
bytes of source code 74\hpercent was written
by the most active users. Democracy and decentrallization

179
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:59,290
of Open Source will require diverse communities
to enable more stable democratic processes

180
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:08,280
and achieving real decentraltion. Open Source
project often also proudly refer to their

181
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,810
Meritocracy, the belief that those with merit
throw to the top that they should be given

182
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:24,549
more opportunities and rewards, sadly the
term Meritocracy was negatively coined for

183
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:32,100
a system with highly critical approaches.
Slater cently described it as a sort of meter

184
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,650
story which we repeat to each other and which
we use to construct other stories that then

185
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:43,660
explain things, for example, while people
are included or excluded from our projects.

186
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,210
Per tot crazies often sell\h‑‑\h‑‑
celebrated as objectives the, home general

187
00:20:49,210 --> 00:21:01,470
nosty of Open Source it exacerbates institutional
liesed I believe equality\h‑‑\h‑‑

188
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:07,130
we have to find new models to value contribution.
When you're thinking about building the few

189
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,679
lure of Open Source, we have to include those
who have less opportunity, less time, and

190
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:19,100
less money that would allow them to freely
contribute. We need to rethink what is being

191
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,780
valued in Open Source projects, especially
with the needs of mar Nan naturalized people

192
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:34,150
in our minds (Mganilized) and our main question
should always be, two we care for? Do we care

193
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:41,640
for contributors who contribute or do we care
for people? This question is an essential

194
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,880
one and a topic that is near and dear to me.
People in our Open Source communities experience

195
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,780
not only good times, they experience bad times,
burnouts, mental health issues like depression

196
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,810
and much more.

197
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,190
These are serious issues which we can't ignore.
And some of them are even enforced through

198
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:07,620
structural inequality, Mertocr averciy and
community related issues, we as members of

199
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,679
Open Source communities have to implement
a culture where mental health issues are not

200
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,450
sigmatized. Where we talk openly about them
and lead an open discussion about how to avoid

201
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:25,090
people burning out through Open Source contributions.
We have to implement a culture in which people

202
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,820
are heard and they know that there are people
who care for them. We have to make sure to

203
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,299
be there for the people in our projects and
communities. Not because we want them to keep

204
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:43,861
contributing, but because we care for the
people. You know that in our bodies with have

205
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:50,260
arteries and veins, both parts of our circulatory
system. Arteries are the blood vessels that

206
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:57,730
carry blood away from the heart, mostly oxygenated
blood. There's a special coronary artery located

207
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,809
directly at our heart. Its job is to supply
blood to the heart muscle and thus keep it

208
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:10,410
working. Still, it sometimes happens that
there's plaque build up along the inner walls

209
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:16,270
of the artery of the heart. This plaque mare
rows the artery, reduces blood flow to the

210
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:22,510
heart. It can progress without anyone noticing
evidence of it for years, and what happens

211
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:29,730
there is called coronary artery disease. As
it progresses, it leads to lack of rock general

212
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:37,980
in the body's cells, can cause chest pain
and finally lead to death. In Open Source,

213
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,559
our communities are our hearts. They neurorich
the entire body, our projects, without our

214
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,370
communities, Open Source is lost. Narrowing
those communities by limiting and restricting

215
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:56,820
their spaces leads to serious problems. For
individuals, communities, the products we're

216
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,840
building, and finally endangers the future
of Open Source in general.

217
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:07,290
There are already many initiatives and individuals
in Open Source and tech that are working on

218
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:13,050
improving all those topics. These people and
their allies are spending a significant amount

219
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:19,429
of time on improving the culture we have in
Open Source today. Some of them are, for example,

220
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:27,820
black girls code, LGBT tech, model view culture,
Trans tech and many more. The least we all

221
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:35,240
should do is listen to them. Support their
work, share what they're saying. And transfer

222
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:42,580
this to the communities we're all in. We have
to widen our communities, welcome and appreciate

223
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:48,010
everyone to ensure that our heart keeps beating
and to ensure that Open Source can have a

224
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:55,380
future. Because Open Source can only have
a future if it does everything to be inclusive.

225
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,380
Thank you. (Applause)
>> Wow! Thank you, Lena. Before we start with

226
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,380
the next talk, we'll\h‑‑ we get set up
and I think we'll have another four minutes

227
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,380
to catch up with the other tracks, so take
your time, we'll start in a little bit. Thank
