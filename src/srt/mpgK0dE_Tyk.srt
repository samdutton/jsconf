10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,210
hi guys

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,669
I hope you've had a great conference I'm

12
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:29,110
really excited to be speaking to you

13
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,419
today my clicker is not clicking so I'm

14
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:35,500
gonna use this okay so hello world I'm

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,170
Christian by day I'm a software engineer

16
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,910
I work at Vistaprint in the Greater

17
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,800
Boston area I have a bunch of my

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,790
colleagues here by night I am a total

19
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,970
nerd I love hanging out at meetups going

20
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,680
to hackathons and checking out the

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,110
latest and greatest in technology here

22
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,180
is an obligatory picture of me wearing a

23
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,730
dorky they are glasses that I'm sure in

24
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,710
five years people will laugh at if not

25
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,010
now but the thing is this picture was

26
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,869
taken at a hackathon and a lot of my

27
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:06,970
experiences with augmented reality and

28
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,470
virtual reality actually come from

29
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,750
hackathons I still remember the very

30
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,060
first hackathon that I went to that was

31
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,030
a VR hack and during that time was the

32
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,670
first time I tried the vive headset

33
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,110
before the hackathon I didn't even know

34
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,700
what a vive headset was I didn't know

35
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,960
what a cardboard was I didn't know what

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,450
the difference between the two were

37
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,460
going to this and experiencing virtual

38
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,440
reality for the first time was

39
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,750
awe-inspiring it's something that you

40
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,670
really have to experience in order to

41
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,150
understand since then I've gone to a ton

42
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,010
of other hackathons with a bunch of my

43
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,140
friends the one at the top is the

44
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,450
discover AR hackathon and there we

45
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,729
invented a way in order to do gesture

46
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,920
based authentication for virtual reality

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,189
spaces hollow sense was another

48
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,799
hackathon with using the hololens and

49
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,100
for that we did things like a sonar for

50
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,860
the blind and subtitles for people so

51
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,409
the versatility of virtual reality is

52
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,450
boundless you can do anything that you

53
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,229
put your mind to and it's really really

54
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,060
exciting living in the present the

55
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,670
technology that we have today is what we

56
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,120
have been dreaming for about four years

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,819
does anyone remember this scene from

58
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,300
Star Wars which doesn't have sound

59
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,069
anyway the idea is that

60
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,150
this scene came up it was the very first

61
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,590
representation of augmented reality in

62
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,519
the cinema this is one Princess Leia

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,890
asks for help from obi-wan Kenobi

64
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,379
and so this is interesting right because

65
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,780
this is decades ago and we are still not

66
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,939
quite there with the technology but we

67
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,909
have made a lot of progress so I have a

68
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,069
short quiz for you guys can you guess

69
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,409
this is called a stereoscopic photo

70
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:53,629
can you guess when the stereoscopic

71
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:58,549
photo was first made 1920 1940 or 1960

72
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,500
okay raise your hand if you think it's

73
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,439
1920 1940 1960 well you guys are all

74
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,370
right on okay how about this one so this

75
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,129
device was made in 1950 can you guess

76
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:16,489
what it was called the sense box virtual

77
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:21,260
sphere or sensorama sense box virtual

78
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,209
sphere Center Rama nice so if you think

79
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:26,810
about it

80
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,370
we've been thinking about virtual

81
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,290
reality and what it means to be inside

82
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,329
of a different world for a long time

83
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,519
the sensorama was supposed to be not

84
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,919
just vision like the the stereoscopic

85
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,319
photograph but it also incorporated

86
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,079
other senses things like sound also

87
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,419
feeling so for example have you ever

88
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,430
gone to those 4d movies where they like

89
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,500
show something scary on the screen and

90
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,299
spritz water on you to make it feel as

91
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:52,790
if it's attacking so stuff like that the

92
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,709
idea of virtual reality and augmented

93
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,930
reality is that it augments all the

94
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,590
first senses not just vision or sound

95
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,729
okay what about this device it's

96
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,169
starting to look a little bit more like

97
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:05,449
a cardboard is it the vision box

98
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:08,169
telesphere mask or reality glasses

99
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:11,349
vision box tell us through your mask

100
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:14,769
reality glasses listens telesphere masks

101
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,109
so as the years progressed these devices

102
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:19,849
became smaller and smaller and we

103
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:21,709
started attaching it to our periphery

104
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,430
but to our vision okay one more this is

105
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,500
called the VPL data suit can you guys

106
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,699
guess when I was invented 1980 1990 or

107
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:38,840
2000 1980 1990 2000 cool it was 1980

108
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,440
in the 1980s so the vpl data suit the

109
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,200
whole idea was that this was rigged with

110
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,930
motors and vibrators so that as you

111
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,669
walked around in this virtual world you

112
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,680
could feel different objects there now

113
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,480
it looks really doofy and it feels kind

114
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,669
of silly to do something like that but

115
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,470
the thing is stuff like this exists

116
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,130
today in fact one of my teammates from

117
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,020
one of my colleagues from university

118
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,080
started a company recently called hard

119
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,120
light VR and they do this full-on

120
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
bodysuit that you put on and as you walk

121
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,750
around in the virtual world it'll

122
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,970
vibrate across your back so that you can

123
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,190
feel as if you're hitting against a wall

124
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,220
and stuff like that so these dreams are

125
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,320
really becoming realities and if you

126
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,720
think about it there's so many different

127
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,700
devices on the market today this is the

128
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,440
vibe has anyone here tried the vibe

129
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,290
before okay a bunch of you guys the vibe

130
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,960
is a virtual reality device but it also

131
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,150
has a camera on the front so you can do

132
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,889
augmented reality so you can't see your

133
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,570
surroundings it comes with two

134
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,919
controllers and the way that this one

135
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,020
works is that your tether tethered to a

136
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,630
debt like a desktop computer so although

137
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,250
you can move around and maybe like a

138
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,470
three meter square box you can't really

139
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,650
move past that this one's called the

140
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,690
oculus rift it's very similar

141
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,700
it has controllers and it's also ten

142
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,760
tethered to a desktop then we get into

143
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,890
devices that allow you to move around

144
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,690
freely because all of the processing is

145
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,000
on board the device so this one is the

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,729
Google daydream and with this what they

147
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,010
did was all of the processing for it is

148
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,139
on Europe you're on your phone similar

149
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,990
to the Google cardboard and lastly

150
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,360
there's things like the hololens this

151
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,190
one again has all of the processing on

152
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,200
the device in fact it runs Windows a

153
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,910
Windows 10 machine running on the device

154
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,910
so that you can walk around the hololens

155
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,440
is different from these other devices

156
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,539
because it's augmented reality and what

157
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,580
that means is instead of just being able

158
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,560
to see the screen in front of you you

159
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,970
can see the surroundings and see

160
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,430
holograms overlaid on top of it so

161
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,440
that's pretty cool and have you guys

162
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,050
seen this in the news anyone so this is

163
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,120
a new augmented reality device called

164
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,340
the magic leaf and whether or not we'll

165
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,140
be walking around with devices like

166
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,289
these strapped to our heads

167
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,389
I'd like you to imagine a future of

168
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,919
augmented reality so in this video this

169
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,469
is a video called hyper reality it's a

170
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:04,080
simulation of what a shopping experience

171
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,089
might be if you have augmented reality

172
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:08,789
everywhere and so here there's a little

173
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:10,169
pet that's kind of like a shopping

174
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:12,180
helper that tells you what you forget

175
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,589
but as you look around you see that

176
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:16,050
there are ads shown on different parts

177
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,139
of the of the store you can see that it

178
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,759
recognized that those are coconuts or

179
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,710
pineapples and based on that it's able

180
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,199
to say hey you forgot this item in your

181
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,379
grocery cart or it's able to add

182
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,449
additional information about any item

183
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,689
you pick up now what would a world like

184
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:36,119
this look like if it crashed so here's

185
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,009
an example of the system rebooting and

186
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,229
here you can see that once the system is

187
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:42,809
off this is kind of the imagination that

188
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:45,809
they had is you have a bunch of markers

189
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:49,020
in order to detect where to place this

190
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,319
augmentation on top of in order to do AG

191
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,389
mented reality like this we need markers

192
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:56,399
in the real world that are able to tell

193
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,769
us where the where the device goes on

194
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:04,110
top of so it's funny that we use this as

195
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,199
imagination but this is two years ago

196
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,479
Alibaba already offers a VR shopping

197
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,610
experience you can put on a cardboard

198
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,830
headset go into the store and pick out

199
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,689
products that you want to buy you can

200
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,370
look at it and you can check out right

201
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,529
from the virtual store so this isn't

202
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:21,449
really the future it's already the

203
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:25,139
present there are other devices there

204
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,419
are other applications of virtual and

205
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,389
augmented reality to discover VR applied

206
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,969
it for an educational purpose and what

207
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,010
they did was if you wanted to for

208
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,529
example teach kids about sharks you

209
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,300
can't take them underwater but you can

210
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,180
give them a headset to take a look at a

211
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,720
different wildlife this idea of using

212
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,509
virtual reality for education is really

213
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:50,250
interesting because it gives you a new

214
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,069
way of processing information one of the

215
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:55,769
hackathons that I judged last year the

216
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,560
MIT reality virtually hackathon one of

217
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,139
the teams had a really interesting idea

218
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,000
say you have a ton of MRI scans that are

219
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,610
flat 2d images what if we paddled

220
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,709
up and stack them right next to each

221
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,079
other so that you can get a 3d vision of

222
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,269
the brain it's a whole new way of

223
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,640
processing data that used to be static

224
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,500
because now you can look inside the

225
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,630
human body or look inside the brain and

226
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,640
analyze things in a way that you never

227
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,450
could before

228
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,540
and then there's more fun applications

229
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,279
anyone here still play Pokemon go

230
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,000
Pokemon oh I have two hands on maybe

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,320
three Pokemon go maybe a year ago was

232
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,810
like all the rage and why was it so

233
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,570
popular although it was a very simple

234
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,790
idea there wasn't any interaction

235
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,130
between the Pokemon and the Saran and

236
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,029
its background

237
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,790
it made it contextual it made it feel as

238
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,800
if the Pokemon was actually there and

239
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,470
this is really easy to do right you

240
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,029
could do this in a web browser super

241
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,130
simply just use a video feed and then

242
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,380
overlay a div on top of it augmented

243
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,899
reality augmented reality does not have

244
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,160
to be complicated another example of a

245
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,050
useful product that you might think of

246
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,260
is Wayfarer Wayfarer came out with this

247
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,149
augmented reality application that would

248
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,220
let you visualize furniture before you

249
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,350
bought it because they're an online

250
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,199
shopping retailer they want you to be

251
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:21,329
able to feel confident in the furniture

252
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,579
that you buy and how it would look in

253
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,529
your space before you make the purchase

254
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:28,050
now this was originally written using

255
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,690
the Google's tango can tango enabled

256
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,430
devices but I believe that they've now

257
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,649
moved on to air core so there's a lot of

258
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,329
different kinds of devices that allow

259
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:37,800
you to do really interesting things

260
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,970
these days virtual and augmented reality

261
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,269
are about to revolutionize how we live

262
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,190
and experience the world around us if

263
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,290
you think about it these examples that I

264
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,750
showed you might seem kind of silly but

265
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,699
so did the first few days first few

266
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,920
years of the Internet it kind of feels

267
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,540
like the space that we're in right now

268
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,870
with virtual and augmented reality is

269
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,410
this is like 1990s we're just figuring

270
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,029
out what it should look like what it

271
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:07,290
should feel like and it's a really

272
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,380
exciting time to be in and because of

273
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,600
this I think it's really important to

274
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,850
talk about who has access to these

275
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,709
devices and how we can make it more

276
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,470
available to everyone around the

277
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,730
world democratizing AR means that one

278
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,500
everyone has access to an AR enabled

279
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,800
device and to anyone can build augmented

280
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,820
reality experiences now if you look at

281
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,370
so if you look at um all of those

282
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,530
devices that I showed you before none of

283
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,390
those were web-based right we had the

284
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,490
vibe we had the hololens we had the

285
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,890
oculus but the thing is if you look at

286
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,810
how many of these devices sold and

287
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,030
compared to the Google cardboard for

288
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,710
instance you'll see that the Google

289
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,100
cardboard vastly outsold all of the

290
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,650
other devices combined what is this

291
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,290
telling us people that are trying out

292
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,150
virtual and augmented reality for the

293
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,550
very first time are doing so on low-end

294
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,890
devices things like the Google cardboard

295
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,260
or on their mobile phones and if you

296
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,030
think about it that makes sense our

297
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,820
mobile phones have become so powerful

298
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,310
over the last few years it's it possible

299
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,460
to do augmented reality applications

300
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,490
with them so if you think about it

301
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,130
everyone already has access to an air

302
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,110
device it's in their back pockets or

303
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,470
phones and the second one is anyone can

304
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,510
build an AR experience if we make it

305
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,640
easy to put together an augmented

306
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,160
reality experience just as it is to

307
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,350
build a website then anyone can start

308
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,710
building these things by themselves so

309
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,830
as web developers I believe that we can

310
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,540
shape the future of virtual and

311
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,370
augmented reality by building

312
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,500
applications for the mobile web there

313
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,750
are already a lot of api's that enable

314
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,420
us to do this and so today I'm going to

315
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,370
talk to you guys about one way that we

316
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,240
can we can get there so first let's talk

317
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,150
about the present state of web and web

318
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,410
the yarn air so first when you think

319
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,120
about web vr there are a lot of

320
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,250
different libraries out there the most

321
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,800
basic of which is WebGL WebGL is if you

322
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,930
want to write like pure vector math in

323
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,670
order to develop your virtual reality

324
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,580
applications 3GS is a JavaScript library

325
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,460
that was built on top of WebGL and what

326
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,590
it does is it exposes higher-level API

327
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,540
so you can do things like create cameras

328
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,730
or place objects without really having

329
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,010
to worry about like all of the vertices

330
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,590
vertex math there are two more libraries

331
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,510
that I'm really excited about right now

332
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,400
one is a frame which you might have

333
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,380
heard about before and the other is

334
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,410
react 360 a frame allows you to create

335
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,260
virtual reality applications using a

336
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,390
component based architecture it like

337
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,000
HTML components so in order to for

338
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,390
example create a box you just have HTML

339
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,330
tags and a box it's very simple

340
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,460
you should definitely check it out the

341
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,500
AK 360 is another interesting one

342
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,810
especially at JS conf I feel like a lot

343
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,910
of us are really into react and the

344
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,620
reason is because it helps us manage

345
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,680
complex application state so if you have

346
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,540
a virtual reality application that has

347
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,430
many different components that need to

348
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,410
talk to each other and need to be able

349
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,360
to say hey like this button was quick so

350
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,000
turn this view on react 360 is a really

351
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,480
interesting choice reactor 60 offers

352
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,370
something that has a model that's

353
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,650
slightly different from a frame so it

354
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,500
has this notion of panels and models a

355
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,020
panel is basically something in 3d space

356
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,120
that's flat so think of something like a

357
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,030
paper or a post around the wall a model

358
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,650
is something that's three-dimensional

359
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,950
think of like a model of a sofa we'll

360
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,520
come back to this later now let's talk

361
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,370
about web AR so web AR is still kind of

362
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,410
in its infancy there are three kind of

363
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,300
big libraries that people tend to use

364
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,040
when working with web AR ojs is one of

365
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,460
them jsr Rico and lastly a rjs the thing

366
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,010
is all of these libraries so are eco and

367
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,630
ojs are built on top of the article so

368
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,090
Ericka is basically a library that was

369
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,860
written in C that allows you to detect

370
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,520
certain types of markers and figure out

371
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,800
what the poses of those markers so that

372
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,810
you can put items on top of it I'll

373
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,210
explain that in a second a rjs was

374
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,460
poured it uses a our tool kit on the

375
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,260
underside so those are like the two

376
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,130
competing frameworks right now a ijs is

377
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,170
pretty awesome like I think of all of

378
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,120
the libraries that I've used so far RJ

379
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,280
seems to be the one that's farthest

380
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,340
along you can use a rjs with

381
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,080
frame so for example if you want to

382
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,510
create augmented reality in your a frame

383
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,800
application there's this really easy

384
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,450
component that you can use in order to

385
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,550
add augmented reality to your a frame

386
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,740
application and less than ten lines of

387
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,770
HTML so if this is something that works

388
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,080
for you then definitely check it out now

389
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,340
looking at the slide you're thinking

390
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,930
okay Christina you're just telling me to

391
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,570
go home and check out a rjs but the

392
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,820
thing is I've used this before and I ran

393
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,530
into some problems especially because

394
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,290
the markers aren't very customizable

395
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,880
these are the markers that AR all of

396
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,290
those libraries that I talked to you

397
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,530
guys about before I use so they use the

398
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,250
article markers or the hero markers AR

399
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,980
Jas uses the hero marker and you can

400
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,600
customize what goes in the middle of it

401
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,370
but you can't customize the borders so

402
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,320
you still have these really thick black

403
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,940
borders if you want to use these markers

404
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,980
and while it's fine for some

405
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,570
applications if you want to put it on

406
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,310
like a poster or if you want to put it

407
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,950
on something that is designed it can be

408
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,780
a little bit frustrating to have to deal

409
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,560
with these limitations so that's kind of

410
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,690
where we're at right now with Web VR and

411
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,400
AR there's a lot going on and it's

412
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,910
constantly evolving next I want to talk

413
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,000
to you about QR a rjs and how you can

414
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,850
use it so what is curare rjs when I was

415
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,290
working on a project a while ago at a

416
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,450
hackathon I noticed that these markers

417
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,160
look just like you are codes and yet

418
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,650
they're not so the idea was could we use

419
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,800
QR codes instead now QR codes don't have

420
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,650
to look ugly snapchat uses basically a

421
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,810
QR code in order to share your share

422
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,000
contact information the one right below

423
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,950
that is from Twitter so Twitter also

424
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,620
uses QR codes and you can customize QR

425
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,230
codes to your heart's extent pretty much

426
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,270
you can change the color you can change

427
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,810
the corner eyelets and the dots that go

428
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,240
inside of it this means that if you

429
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,760
wanted to add a QR code to your design

430
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,490
and make it look use make it make it

431
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,820
design to fit with the rest of your

432
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,520
whatever whatever you yeah to make it

433
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,140
fit with the rest of it you can

434
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,050
definitely do it the other thing is

435
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,480
because QR codes are actually a code

436
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,520
is standardized across multiple

437
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,130
different platforms many phones already

438
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,559
have QR code scanners for example

439
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,720
iPhones have a QR code scanner in the

440
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,549
Chrome browser so you can just point to

441
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:11,500
a QR code and scan it and go to the

442
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,610
website directly so this is kind of how

443
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,700
standards are proliferate right I wanted

444
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,320
to come up with a new way of combining

445
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,340
QR codes with the existing AR AR

446
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,620
libraries so introducing QR a rjs cure a

447
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,590
rjs is a way for you to add augmented

448
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,290
reality to your applications that uses

449
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,990
QR codes as markers there are two

450
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,700
different types of models that you can

451
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,400
add to your applications one is a 3d

452
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,970
model and second is a 2d plane and this

453
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,490
is partially inspired by react 360s

454
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,710
notion of planes and models and the idea

455
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,110
is if you want to create a 3d object

456
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,870
then you probably probably need a higher

457
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,600
level of computation but if you're just

458
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,030
transforming a 2d plane then you can

459
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,740
probably get away with doing a little

460
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:09,610
less that's my demo it works so that's a

461
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,830
great transition so instead of talking

462
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,330
about it I figured it would be a good

463
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,549
idea to just show you what I mean so

464
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:17,799
we'll see if this works because my

465
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,020
presentation is on a different slide ok

466
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:31,780
so here we are okay so earlier you might

467
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,240
have noticed that a bunch of these cards

468
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,429
are on your table you can go ahead and

469
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:39,610
try scan the QR code disclaimer I

470
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,290
haven't tested this on all mobile

471
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,570
devices just my own and it was still a

472
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,520
little janky so definitely try it out

473
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,929
but you can also try it out on your

474
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:49,179
laptop it might be smoother you can just

475
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:54,460
go to cure a r-j Escom so I'm going to

476
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,510
go ahead and open up the first demo

477
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:03,270
which is this guy

478
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,590
okay so what this is doing right now is

479
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,620
its use the getusermedia in order to

480
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,350
pull the video video feed from the

481
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,360
browser and then once it had that it

482
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,580
added it to the screen using a canvas

483
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,590
you see some glitching it's not perfect

484
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,990
yet but what this is doing is now it's

485
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,890
overlaying my r2d2 on top of this

486
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,090
remember that example that we looked at

487
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,950
earlier where r2d2 is projecting a

488
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,570
hologram we're going to try it and go

489
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,850
ahead and recreate that using curare rjs

490
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,780
so the first step is we need to create a

491
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,080
3d model in order to create a 3d model I

492
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:50,390
used a software called blender so

493
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,880
basically so what I did was a user in

494
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,010
order to create this model it's kind of

495
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,350
cute if you look at it when it's stable

496
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,810
I basically just took a sphere and a

497
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,790
cylinder join them together then I use

498
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,410
something called the texture paint in

499
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,810
order to paint on top of it you can go

500
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,880
ahead and download an actual model off

501
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,040
of a lot of different websites there are

502
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,780
a lot of sites that offer free models

503
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,030
that you can use but in essence there's

504
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,590
two main pieces to the model

505
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,900
there's the object file and the material

506
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,480
file so the object file basically says

507
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,700
this is what the 3d object is and the

508
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,470
object fell is dictated by a set of

509
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,840
vertices so for example in the case of

510
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,170
r2 you had points alongside everywhere

511
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,760
on the sphere you notice that it wasn't

512
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,340
perfectly round this is in order to

513
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,260
optimize for performance the fewer

514
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,450
vertices there are the less vector math

515
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,730
you have to do the second piece of the

516
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,800
puzzle is the material file and what the

517
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,470
material file says is given this image

518
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,750
or the given this image how do you map

519
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,210
it on top of the object let's take a

520
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,730
look at those now so if I go ahead and

521
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,200
open up my console should be able to

522
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,280
show you this guy so this is my

523
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,410
beautiful painting of r2d2 so if you

524
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,170
look at all this code is on github by

525
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,550
the way I'll show you that in a second

526
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,429
but this is the so this is the texture

527
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:18,649
map that it's using and so the material

528
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:20,629
file says given this image how do you

529
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:24,980
wrap it around this model object okay so

530
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,360
what does the code look like for this

531
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,779
I'm using the cure AR 3d library and

532
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:32,330
I've can you guys see this in the back

533
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,919
can you give me a thumbs up okay cool

534
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,379
so what I'm doing here is I'm using the

535
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:42,619
the QR Air library first I need to use

536
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,080
three J s the cute the library takes in

537
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,409
a three J s object so you can pass in

538
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,029
whatever you want you can create

539
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:51,440
multiple different objects and group

540
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,850
them together if that's what you want to

541
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,980
transpose on this plane but it son

542
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,470
opinionated about that so you need a

543
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,840
dependency on three the three object

544
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,919
loader and the three material loader

545
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,700
lastly over here I'm importing the QR AR

546
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,159
library itself so it's on unpackaged so

547
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,679
you don't have to use npm fee if you're

548
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,570
kind of just in the browser but if you

549
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,740
are an NPM you can just npm install that

550
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,629
once we have that this is all the code

551
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:22,970
it takes in order to write this so first

552
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,649
we're getting three this is just a

553
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:27,860
selector the important code is over here

554
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,779
first we're creating a material loader

555
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:32,059
and an object loader once we have that

556
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,519
we're saying load all the materials from

557
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:38,990
this asset path load the r2d2 MTL file

558
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,360
which is a material file and once these

559
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,570
are pre-loaded set it on the object then

560
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,480
load the r2d2 object file and once we

561
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,690
have that we will have a 3GS object

562
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,600
which we can pass into QRA our 3d the

563
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,309
only line of code that you really need

564
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,049
from the library is this one right here

565
00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:01,759
you just call QRA rjs qra our 3d passing

566
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,879
the library three Jas and then you need

567
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:07,309
to pass in the root element so this is

568
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,200
where it'll go ahead and add this whole

569
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,269
overlay so it'll go ahead and request

570
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:13,100
for user media then create a canvas and

571
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,899
add the video overlay this is telling it

572
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:21,470
about how big your marker is in the

573
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,360
physical world so in this case it's

574
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,970
about 10 centimeters so 100 millimeters

575
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,220
you need this because when you transpose

576
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,900
a marker in the real world

577
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,940
you need to know how much to rotate it

578
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,250
by in the virtual world so you need the

579
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,100
size of the actual physical marker next

580
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,530
you pass in the object and lastly you

581
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,540
pass in a scale of the object in this

582
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,130
case the object was kind of small when I

583
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,410
exported it so I just bumped it up by 20

584
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,870
and that's pretty much it once you have

585
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:54,530
this your AR will go in find the div

586
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,930
that's passed in in this case to our AR

587
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,750
3d and if we look at it in the elements

588
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,680
panel you'll see that it added two

589
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,980
things this canvas is the three j/s

590
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,410
canvas so this is the WebGL canvas that

591
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,170
it renders the model on top of and the

592
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,760
second thing that it added is this video

593
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,550
so that it streams the video from the

594
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,600
webcam feed and once you have all of

595
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,810
this you can just put this in front of

596
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,670
it and rotate it around and that's

597
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:33,980
pretty much it so in a few lines of code

598
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,140
you're able to add a 3d model to your

599
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,750
application it automatically detects the

600
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,820
QR code and it's able to transpose the

601
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,800
image on top of it you don't have to

602
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,780
worry about any of that vector math and

603
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,300
all you really need to do is just create

604
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,340
the 3d model that you want to pass in

605
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,000
and configure it I want to show you

606
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,820
another demo so this one is using the

607
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,000
two D transpose method so if you go to a

608
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
QR AR 2d HTML this is just a flat image

609
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,870
and once it loads you'll see that is

610
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,670
transposing this image on top of this

611
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,760
object let's take a look at what this

612
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,530
looks like so I mentioned earlier that

613
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,420
there's the two different with two

614
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,220
different types of models the 3d model

615
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,690
of where you want to create a like a

616
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,970
whole 3d object and you want to put it

617
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,490
in the scene and secondly the 2d plane

618
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,590
so this is like for example if you

619
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,600
wanted to replicate something like paper

620
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,490
or a menu item that you wanted to click

621
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,830
around in now one thing that kind of

622
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,080
frustrated me when I used react 360 is

623
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,180
that it doesn't actually support HTML a

624
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,280
regular jeaious JSX

625
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,559
you have to write specific components

626
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,129
texts or VR buttons in order to create a

627
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:49,279
panel so what I did here was using the

628
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,649
same principles as the three of the 3d

629
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:54,620
model it's a little glitchy so bear with

630
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,509
that but the code is really simple in

631
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:03,289
order to set this up we just need one

632
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,440
line of code that's it

633
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,049
QR a rjs here are a are 2d it takes in

634
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:11,210
three things one is the root element

635
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,090
similar to the 3d version the second is

636
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,129
the size of the marker again same as the

637
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,289
previous version and the less is it

638
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:21,080
takes an HTML element so you can pass in

639
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,809
any HTML element in this into this in

640
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,850
this case we're passing in this panel

641
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,299
and all the panel has is this image

642
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:31,399
asset logo but this could have anything

643
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,139
in the world it could have text it could

644
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:34,669
have men you could have a whole react

645
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,999
app or an iframe and what it does under

646
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:40,129
the hood is it goes in and it uses the

647
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:43,100
same the same math in order to figure

648
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,590
out what the transpose it is and then it

649
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,080
uses CSS transforms in order to overlay

650
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,830
the HTML element on top of that QR code

651
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,539
what this means is that we don't need a

652
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,090
like a WebGL canvas so we're saving a

653
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,029
lot of computational power there it also

654
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:00,799
means that if you already have something

655
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,210
that you kind of want to throw together

656
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,059
really quickly then it's easy to do if

657
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,940
you've ever dealt with like trying to

658
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,009
add just a simple image and threw it in

659
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:12,139
like the 3d world you know that it's

660
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:14,869
like a huge pain in the butt this is way

661
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:16,730
easier right you just need an HTML

662
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,860
element and you can pass in whatever you

663
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,860
want to it and so with this one line of

664
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,039
code you can create a flat panel in this

665
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,590
3d space that's pretty much all you need

666
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,850
and if you look at what it generates all

667
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,919
it has is this is the panel that we're

668
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,499
passing in hey I wonder if this works I

669
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:39,710
could probably edit it I haven't tried

670
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:45,320
this let's see if that works so if I add

671
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,430
high on there

672
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,760
you can see that you can barely see it

673
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,240
but it's at the top of the je s so like

674
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:02,320
anything that you want in there so you

675
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,360
can imagine what you could imagine some

676
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,880
of the possibilities here if you if you

677
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,350
were to use something like this then you

678
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,360
could create things like an additional

679
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,550
menu or for example say you I'm just

680
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,690
making this up but say you have a

681
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,309
business card and you want to have like

682
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:17,320
a add me on LinkedIn button you could

683
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,820
totally do that it's just a website

684
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,270
right um ok cool

685
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:34,400
so with that I'll go back to my slides

686
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,720
ok so just to recap we looked at two

687
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,510
different demos one was the QR a our 3d

688
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,970
version in order to get this to work all

689
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,710
you need to do is first import the

690
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,170
library import the 3 J s dependencies

691
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,179
and then you can use it in your code

692
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:51,880
over here the only line of code from the

693
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,460
library that you need to use is QR a rjs

694
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,920
doc you are a are 3d you pass in the

695
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,640
three library route elements the size of

696
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,800
the scale and lastly the object and the

697
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,980
object and the scale of the object for a

698
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,190
QR AR 2d what you can do is you just

699
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,429
need to again import the library and

700
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:19,090
create an element called panel and or it

701
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,410
doesn't have to be called panel just

702
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,900
create an HTML element and then you pass

703
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,420
in three things the route which is where

704
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,580
the whole thing gets the video and

705
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,400
everything gets added the second is the

706
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,770
marker size and lastly it's the HTML

707
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,929
panel that you want to transpose on top

708
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:35,440
of it

709
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,360
the interesting thing here is you can

710
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,050
combine the two as well so let me go

711
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,440
back to my demo so this is the one that

712
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,720
you guys are probably seen earlier but

713
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:54,250
if you go to index.html you will see

714
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,130
that I've recreated that r2d2 message

715
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,550
over here you have this you have the

716
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:04,030
bots and you have both the 3d and the 2d

717
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,640
overlaid on on the same transpose this

718
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,770
is just a simple example but you could

719
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,570
imagine you can do anything with this if

720
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,490
I hit this will play a sound I think my

721
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,470
computer is muted but you guys kind of

722
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:22,030
heard it earlier so so yeah okay now let

723
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,670
me go back to my slides one more time

724
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:33,160
sorry about that okay so you can combine

725
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,150
pure air 3d and 2d and if you want to

726
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:41,890
use this as of an hour ago it's on NPM

727
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,490
under QRA rjs so feel free to download

728
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,350
it try it out let me know what you think

729
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,950
it's also on unpackage and on github

730
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,720
also stuff that I did today is also

731
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,640
going to be on github so you can use it

732
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,230
as examples if you want to build your

733
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:01,780
application so that's curiae rjs and how

734
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,290
you can use it with a few lines of code

735
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,640
lastly I want to talk to you about the

736
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,310
next steps with QRA rjs and what

737
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,230
augmented what's in store for augmented

738
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,040
reality in the web so let's talk about

739
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,010
how curare rjs works it's kind of it

740
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,380
boils down to these few steps so first

741
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,690
we need to get the users media so this

742
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,640
gets the video stream from the user in

743
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,920
order to analyze this right now and post

744
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,540
putting it on a canvas because there's

745
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,820
no way to get image data directly from a

746
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,700
stream so once we have the image data

747
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,220
all that is is a giant array of all of

748
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,620
the pixels this gets passed into the

749
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,620
marker locator in our case the marker is

750
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,770
a QR code and what it does is given an

751
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,900
image it returns the four corners of the

752
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,930
QR code those four corners get passed

753
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,730
into something called the pose estimator

754
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,860
so it turns out this is actually a very

755
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,530
challenging problem if you have an image

756
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,620
of if you have any image and you have

757
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,960
four points on that image on a flat 2d

758
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,030
image figuring out what the three D

759
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,190
transpose was in order to create that

760
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,750
it's actually a very

761
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,880
some problem to solve and especially

762
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,040
when those four points are coplanar so

763
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,210
they're all in the same plane

764
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,880
you can't 100% be certain what the 3d

765
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,070
rotation is so earlier you saw some

766
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,920
glitches that's because of that but

767
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,080
there are some algorithms out there that

768
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,010
can that can improve that a bit and

769
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,020
lastly once you get the post so the pose

770
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,640
is the rotation and the transform

771
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,610
transpose so for example like the how

772
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,650
many degrees it's rotated in each angle

773
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:39,430
and how far along in each XY and Z plane

774
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,520
it is moved along those get passed into

775
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,620
the 2d view render and the 3d view

776
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,900
render and what those do is those then

777
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,600
create the 2d view and then the 3d view

778
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,760
depending on whether you want a plane or

779
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,300
a model so before we talk about some

780
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,370
improvements let's quickly recap on the

781
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,950
event loop so the event loop if you can

782
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,800
think of this as the event loop

783
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,940
javascript is single threaded so it can

784
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,160
only ever do one thing at a time what

785
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,110
this means is if you're executing code

786
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,040
it can't render you can the so it's

787
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,110
called a loop so oh you can see my mess

788
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:18,790
um so the process the process goes

789
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,540
around in the circle and it has a few

790
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,950
different things that needs to do in

791
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,990
order to re-render the sight style

792
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,419
layout and paint just to oversimplify a

793
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:30,850
bit so every time you render something

794
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,610
on the page it goes through the cycle

795
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,840
now what happens if you have to perform

796
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,000
a task say looping through an array of

797
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,149
4,000 pixels what it does is when it's

798
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:42,399
performing this task it can't go in and

799
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,220
render your render your scene so what

800
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,870
this means is that your scene will seem

801
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,669
kind of janky and that's kind of that's

802
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,830
that's where I'm at with the library

803
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:55,179
right now what you and the other thing

804
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,700
is it can also only the browser can

805
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,070
decide whether it performs the tasks or

806
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,260
skips it and/or performs the render or

807
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,600
not so what you can do in order to

808
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,460
alleviate some of this is use things

809
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,770
like a web worker a web worker is a way

810
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,660
to add a secondary thread to your

811
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,060
JavaScript right now all we've been

812
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,070
using is the UI thread but you can spin

813
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:18,640
up a web worker thread this is similar

814
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,200
to service workers if you've heard of

815
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,770
that term

816
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,680
for and what it does is it takes your

817
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,300
tasks and does the processing on that

818
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,030
thread I tried to use this for the

819
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,070
project and what I found out was that

820
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,860
right now there's a bug where there's a

821
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,690
huge secure the vulnerability with

822
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,240
shared memory buffers and so in order to

823
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,950
share memory from one thread to the

824
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,600
other you have to serialize it down to

825
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,760
like a string and then deserialize it

826
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,650
and so when dealing with really large

827
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,930
images this ended up being slower like

828
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,870
the serializing and deserializing ended

829
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,550
up being slower than just processing it

830
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,470
on the main thread but I expect that to

831
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,930
change in the future another thing that

832
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,700
you can do to improve this performance

833
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,830
is to use something like web assembly if

834
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,540
you use something like web assembly then

835
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,250
what it does is it makes it faster to

836
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,350
process tasks this is because all of

837
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,210
your JavaScript is already compiled so

838
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,590
it doesn't have to interpret it when

839
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,620
it's running again I tried to look into

840
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,330
web assembly and one of the libraries I

841
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,250
looked at it was assembly script all of

842
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,750
the code I have right now is written in

843
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,460
typescript an assembly script is a

844
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,870
library that allows you to take

845
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,700
typescript and transpile it down to web

846
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,970
assembly however using this I learned

847
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,910
that assembly script isn't exactly

848
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,130
typescript it's a subset of it and so I

849
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,690
would have to get rid of a lot of my

850
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,760
classes or custom types in order to use

851
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,120
it but that might be another optimation

852
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,100
optimization to do in the future so the

853
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,260
two places that we can optimize are with

854
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,970
the marker locator and the pose

855
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:46,330
estimator for the marker locator I base

856
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,400
it off of this library called jsq R

857
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,140
which is a pure JavaScript library that

858
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,210
detects the QR code but you could

859
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,500
imagine that if there was a more

860
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,150
efficient library that was say written

861
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,340
in rust or C we could use web assembly

862
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,130
in order to you in order to use that a

863
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,280
faster functionality the second one is

864
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,410
Poe's estimator so this is the thing

865
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,030
that I explained earlier that given the

866
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,040
four corners on a 2d image it's actually

867
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,540
quite complicated to get the 3d

868
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,030
transpose of it and in order to get this

869
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,760
to work I used I based it off of jsr

870
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,610
reco turned out that that library had a

871
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,310
few bugs in it already so that's why

872
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,320
some of the stuff that I was seeing was

873
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,920
not exactly right but one optimization

874
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,320
in his future was would be to maybe like

875
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,450
move off the pose estimator code off to

876
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,250
a web worker because that way it frees

877
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,420
up space for your render

878
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,869
cycle and if you guys are interested

879
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:40,480
this is all on github I currently has

880
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,099
two contributors but if you know

881
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:45,430
anything about WebGL or vector math feel

882
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,319
free to contribute to it or just check

883
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:47,829
it out

884
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:51,720
so I really believe that the future of

885
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,369
augmented reality for the web is what we

886
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:57,460
make of it I think that going along

887
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,049
there's a lot of different libraries

888
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:01,000
that are have popped up in the past and

889
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,190
that will continue to pop up in order to

890
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,329
do AR in the browser so with that being

891
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,299
said I want to leave you with this

892
00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:10,930
question

893
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,900
why do you love JavaScript my favorite

894
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,990
thing about JavaScript is that I love it

895
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,030
because of its reach and its versatility

896
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,430
writing applications in JavaScript is

897
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,170
easy because you don't need to set up a

898
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,480
whole development environment anyone can

899
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,369
do it it's very easy to write JavaScript

900
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,680
in the script tag in an HTML page on the

901
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,430
browser I'm really excited about this

902
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,559
prospect because it means that we can

903
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:38,200
allow anyone that's a really beginner to

904
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,150
programming to build things like

905
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,280
augmented reality and this is just

906
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,869
scratching the surface there's so many

907
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:45,599
new technologies that are coming to

908
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,040
JavaScript and to the web land

909
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,079
especially with things like web

910
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,520
assemblies so for example like

911
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,500
tensorflow j/s is now a thing so you can

912
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,970
run machine learning in the browser and

913
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,720
I think it'll keep growing the mobile

914
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,579
web is powerful enough to run for

915
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:02,740
virtual and augmented reality today and

916
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,510
everyone already has the mobile device

917
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,059
so I invite you to build the future of

918
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:13,470
augmented reality together thank you
