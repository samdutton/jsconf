00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,510

hi I'm Isaac I do a lot of 3d stuff and

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,980
this is a talk that I've been working on

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,650
for a while it never really says the

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,240
words javascript in it and is more about

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,880
stories in general ah so just to show

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,739
you guys I'm opening the browser so this

7
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,230
is all running in browser using a 3gs

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,860
and oh I'm supposed to screen capture

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,489
this one second and basically what I've

10
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,340
been thinking about a lot is how do we

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,879
use computers to aid us in sort of

12
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,949
explanation whether it's explanation

13
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:48,329
about data visualization or in this case

14
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,879
explanation of I don't know something

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,230
really weird and I find myself kind of

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,239
frustrated at how much computers can do

17
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,120
and how little we do with them if you

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,160
look at most people who have you know a

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,769
macbook pro like the GPU and that is

20
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,870
absolutely insane but we only use it for

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,090
watching videos on Facebook and that's

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,000
really really frustrating to me so I'm

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,580
sort of interested in like what do

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,500
slides look like when we're talking

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,870
about real computing like what is what

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,300
is a story look like when we're talking

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,030
about the GPU and in this case what does

28
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,970
a speech look like so this is called

29
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,240
discovering our prismatic reality and

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,920
yeah here we go that's my website I've

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,480
been seeing a lot of rainbows lately

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,520
like everywhere not just in opals

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,590
glitters or those reflective signs but

34
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,630
when I squint my eyes look at my hair or

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,050
glance out the window for some reason

36
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,850
the more I find them the more I'm able

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,040
to find them it's weird how this works

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,170
this mysterious cycle of rainbow

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,450
spotting it does work though and I'm

40
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,490
sure of it because even now I can see it

41
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,010
on my screen or on the edge of any of

42
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,150
those lights this is a place when I go

43
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,070
to places like the exploratorium which

44
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,870
wields diffraction grading in prisons

45
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,879
the way others wheel paint or film I

46
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,039
arrived and immediately forget where I

47
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,349
came from where I'm going next and fall

48
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,200
into the magic of the spectrum I've been

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,090
trying to figure out why this is why I'm

50
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,340
so

51
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,140
suddenly obsessed with rainbows in such

52
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,510
a specific way it might just be my

53
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,280
imagination but i think i found an

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,560
explanation for this childlike love of

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,950
the multicolored miracles you see when I

56
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,920
was a kid I used to stare at the Sun I'm

57
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,540
sure everybody in this room has done it

58
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,459
and if you're anything like me when your

59
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,230
parents told you not to do it that it

60
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,359
was bad for you it made me want to stare

61
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,639
even longer and tell my pupils hurt

62
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,439
until when I looked away I could see

63
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,870
that strange glittering void trailing my

64
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,909
vision like a frame buffer that hasn't

65
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,000
completely cleared the Sun was so

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,489
beautiful but I could never really see

67
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,430
it my eyes would water or my head start

68
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,139
to throb and that pure white light

69
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,180
remained just out of reach of my

70
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,019
comprehension here's the exciting part

71
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,239
though is that when that light hits a

72
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,959
lens and dissolves into a rainbow that I

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,590
can understand the lens the raindrop the

74
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,349
window whatever the medium of dispersion

75
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,919
was the prism took the single beam to

76
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,439
majestic for me to understand and parsed

77
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,139
it down distributed it smoothly caught

78
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:30,000
across the full spectrum of visible

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,030
light when light it's a prism it feels

80
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,340
like that lens takes this thing that's

81
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,729
so far away and brings it closer to me

82
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:44,400
brings me closer to it so I can see with

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,560
more clarity and fidelity like a

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,169
microscope or a telescope the white

85
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:51,540
light of the Sun is too bright but when

86
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,699
I can translate it so that I'm viewing

87
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,699
it with more of my human facility with

88
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,739
the full capacity of my mind and senses

89
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,629
I can understand it a bit more but this

90
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,639
doesn't just happen with sunlight and

91
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,400
rainbows it feels like I happens when I

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,930
glanced through a petri dish through a

93
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,479
microscope zoom into my street on Google

94
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,819
Earth or see the moons of Jupiter

95
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,759
through a telescope know that distant

96
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,680
thing isn't just sunlight that's

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,989
something else something bigger that

98
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,830
thing it's so far away so hard to grasp

99
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,340
it is deep and pure and beautiful but

100
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,779
it's so big that I can't tell exactly

101
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,030
what it is

102
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,070
it feels alive even though I can't

103
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,140
comprehend life at its scale it feels

104
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,930
like that thing dances that it sings it

105
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,110
feels like that thing feels it feels

106
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,060
like some sort of Beast but I can't

107
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,010
understand it I can't describe it and

108
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,770
every time I try to explain it I can't

109
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,360
find the right words just imagine for a

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,830
moment what the movement of the

111
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,440
molecules in this room looks like the

112
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,420
room scale convection that is happening

113
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,150
before our very eyes the plumes

114
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,190
emanating from each of your mouths as

115
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,370
you breathe the eddies haloing my hands

116
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,210
as i make every single motion not some

117
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,820
faked curl Monet's algorithm or some

118
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,520
voxel-based navier-stokes but the real

119
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,280
deal which requires more computational

120
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,130
power to calculate than every film ever

121
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,820
made combined but we can't see it we

122
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,470
can't understand it it's too far away

123
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,560
our eyes which have come into being over

124
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,450
million years of generational iteration

125
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,250
do not deem that specific vision

126
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,860
necessary for survival this site is part

127
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,170
of how we understand how we feel how we

128
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,900
comprehend but it doesn't comprehend

129
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,440
this turbulence around us now those

130
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,590
fleshy orbs insider head can't see all

131
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,140
the unbelievably unbelievabl beauty

132
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,410
around us but the thing is is that

133
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,510
that's okay because Nature gave us

134
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,760
something even better than this vision

135
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,610
it gave us a way to see this lack of

136
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,640
sight not a way to see the distant space

137
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,950
beasts or understand the pure white

138
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,680
sunlight but rather a way to comprehend

139
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,960
that there are parts of that beasts that

140
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,200
we cannot yet see we cannot see that

141
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,530
indescribable entity but we can see our

142
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,320
own and completeness and with this site

143
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,010
grow that vision that understanding of

144
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,400
all that we are not is quite painful we

145
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,440
don't get to be always we don't get to

146
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,140
see forever it's an understanding that

147
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,600
there is something more that every step

148
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,000
we take forward every time we grow every

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,460
time we discover a way to expand our

150
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,449
vision

151
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,680
there will always be something more and

152
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,889
in that understanding we find direction

153
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:57,779
we find meaning we find fulfillment

154
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:00,589
stories feel to me like they are born of

155
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,930
this understanding they seem to address

156
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,999
truths that are too much to understand

157
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:07,430
all at once and could blind us if we

158
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,610
stared for too long however stories feel

159
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,740
like they can take this truth and unfold

160
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,900
them so that we can look upon them with

161
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,669
our flushy minds and understand

162
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,279
something that we could not be for it's

163
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,439
strange because these things stories try

164
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,740
to explain were there all along they

165
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,150
might have been stuck in the land of

166
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,699
what could be the nebula of that which

167
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,249
is unknown but they were still part of

168
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,409
our reality part of the realm of

169
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:37,310
possibility stories take these phantom

170
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,979
possibilities and make them real they

171
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,080
move us closer to that distant beasts

172
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,659
letting the sea the fold and the furrows

173
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,999
that we had not seen before and by

174
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,310
showing us those parts that we did not

175
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,099
before know existed the stories bring

176
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:54,249
more of that beast more of that light

177
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:59,539
into existence now I want to take a

178
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:01,430
moment here to try to explain to the

179
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,819
best of my ability about how prisms work

180
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,580
I'm not very good at this so bear with

181
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,199
me basically when light enters the

182
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,270
material it's usually just absorbed by

183
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,639
that material each atom but the light

184
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,819
interacts with is another chance for the

185
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:22,490
material to absorb that light making the

186
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,339
material ha or making the election

187
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,810
electrons surrounding that material jump

188
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,439
valence when they do that it emits light

189
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,339
that's what makes a material opaque but

190
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,339
when it's translucent when the light

191
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:39,680
hits the atom if the resonant frequency

192
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,959
of the atom does not match the frequency

193
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,569
of the light the atom cannot keep this

194
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:47,930
light so eventually it basically tries

195
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,149
to hold on to it and it can't and then

196
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,089
it remix it sending the light flying

197
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,160
back into the vacuum until it hits the

198
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,310
next Adam repeating this process of

199
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,750
hitting the atom the atom being like yo

200
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,220
I want this I want this I want this and

201
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,779
then it's like oh I can't I can't take

202
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:05,860
this one it's got to go on on the cool

203
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,600
part about it is that this process of

204
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,630
absorption and readmission takes a bit

205
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,180
of time in the amount of time that it

206
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,750
takes is dependent on the frequency of

207
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,210
the light because the more closely that

208
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,130
the frequency of the atom matches the

209
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,990
frequency of the light the longer it

210
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,420
will hold on to it so basically certain

211
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,210
light travels through material at

212
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,290
different rates this thing is called an

213
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,230
index of refraction and that describes

214
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,779
the optical density of the material in

215
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:40,060
its defined by how closely the

216
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,380
wavelength or frequency of the light

217
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,120
matches the resonant frequency of the

218
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,339
atoms and the material materials with a

219
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:47,020
higher index of refraction will hold on

220
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,040
to light longer and with lower it will

221
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,510
transfer it shorter now the amazing part

222
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,020
is that that miniscule difference in how

223
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,960
the material absorbs and bre emits light

224
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,960
is what causes the rainbow it's the

225
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,390
difference of the material the

226
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,640
difference between materials and the way

227
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,950
that that material interacts with light

228
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,400
that splits light that lets us

229
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,100
understand more about the properties not

230
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,650
just of the material but of light itself

231
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,540
it's right at this surface this meeting

232
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,589
of materials that the light is dispersed

233
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:37,960
it's at this edge this membrane where

234
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,780
the unflattering occurs this corner this

235
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,540
film this transition that's the point

236
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,410
where the light unfolds it's really hard

237
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,339
for me to describe this specific moment

238
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,350
mostly because it is not a thing it is

239
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,170
neither state a north state be neither

240
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,830
medium a nor medium be it's a sliver

241
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,860
it's a rift that lies between them these

242
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,230
slivers to me are the transitions of

243
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,180
stories the cuts between scenes the

244
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,950
chapters of a novel the doors in the

245
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,690
game and there are some of the

246
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,030
most important parts of the piece this

247
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,950
is interesting to me because they are a

248
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,620
place where we as artists can

249
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,510
specifically not actually say anything

250
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,180
we can only say stay a or state B we

251
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,450
can't say the rift in between they are

252
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,180
spaced a moment where the viewers freed

253
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,640
from the rigidity of the plot and gets

254
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,180
to simply be this feels strange as

255
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,580
artists we can guide people in and out

256
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,340
of this transition but at that thin film

257
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,360
we do not have control and in my mind

258
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,740
this unfolding point is where phantom

259
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,160
possibility is made real it's it's quite

260
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,470
a visceral moment to me if it reminds me

261
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,940
of I don't know if you guys have seen

262
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,400
this but that the videos of undersea

263
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,070
pillow lava which sort of billows forth

264
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,350
but in its billowing forth rips itself

265
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,980
open and then more comes out you know

266
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,780
like hardens it hardens immediately and

267
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,420
then but is stretched by more trying to

268
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,980
come out and then rips out and then

269
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,530
continues growing the it's just like the

270
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,280
earth like heaving itself into reality

271
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,130
and that to me is is this rift that

272
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,310
expands reality so that what could be

273
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:31,900
becomes what is now single one of these

274
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,470
corners these pillowy borders is enough

275
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,110
to make me feel ah it is enough but I

276
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,500
still want more I think this is because

277
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,200
the pure white light that a piece can

278
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,110
abstract the more that sorry I think

279
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,640
that this is because the more of the

280
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,170
pure white light that a piece can

281
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,600
abstract the more fulfilling the piece

282
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,020
becomes not just a single prism a single

283
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,630
sound a single sentence but a series of

284
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,640
refraction that takes in different light

285
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,290
from different angles and bends at

286
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,170
different ways it's these pieces of art

287
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,060
that I can go back to again and again

288
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,750
and again Akira Nausicaa burial holy

289
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,900
other they don't just unfold they unfold

290
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,300
in their unfolding refracting light

291
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,910
again and again and again so that every

292
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,460
time I choose to let them transport me I

293
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,490
get to see that unreachable beast

294
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,130
from an angle that I had not before now

295
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,660
this doesn't just mean that more is

296
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,440
better there's a very particular balance

297
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,260
that these objects engage in simply

298
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,270
splitting light as quickly and as much

299
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,430
as possible does not mean that the

300
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,980
splitting will mean anything will you

301
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,500
allow you to see the unique and holy

302
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,320
parts that make up the whole the lenses

303
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
must be placed perfectly each with

304
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,700
intimate knowledge of their location and

305
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,190
purpose the arrangement of these prisms

306
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,380
materials motifs and scenes must be

307
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,529
orchestrated tended those pages in

308
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:05,170
Nausicaa the small mammals and crackers

309
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,570
of crackles of burial can't just

310
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,510
themselves be themselves they must be

311
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,760
part of the whole working together to

312
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,149
construct some sort of meta prism which

313
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,959
diffracts light of a different order

314
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,820
that order of light is so much brighter

315
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,339
more difficult to articulate Lee bend

316
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:27,240
and can much more easily fall into Babel

317
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,690
nihilism insanity and blindness but when

318
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,750
those small pieces miraculously align it

319
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,779
brings us closer to being able to human

320
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,329
I comprehend that deep space beast

321
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,089
turning an even further what could be

322
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:48,920
into an even more majestic what is I

323
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,430
like thinking about precious opals when

324
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,550
talking about this emergence mostly

325
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,050
because I think they're really really

326
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,450
pretty but also they are quite

327
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,329
miraculous they form in the rarest of

328
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:03,339
conditions over millions of years a

329
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:05,890
silica rich solution is deposited in

330
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,140
cracks and voids of a surface as the

331
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,720
water table rises and falls the silica

332
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,649
is concentrated more and more and more

333
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,290
tiny spheres of silica build up slowly

334
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,200
to form the opal the spheres actually

335
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,630
themselves act as a lens causing

336
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,570
diffraction at a microscopic scale but

337
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,760
it isn't just the presence of these

338
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,589
spheres that causes the brilliant

339
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,470
scattering of light all opal is made

340
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,000
from these spheres not just precious

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,940
opal the arrangement of the spheres is

342
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,380
as it equally isn't

343
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,230
as the spheres themselves it is only

344
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,000
when conditions are just right that

345
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,590
these spheres will grow to the exact

346
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,280
size needed it is only then that they

347
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,170
will diffract visible light in the way

348
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,630
that makes them play dance and move they

349
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,000
actually have to form a grid so that all

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,340
their neighboring spheres diffract the

351
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,680
same wavelength of light as the ones

352
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,890
around them and it's funny because I

353
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,620
feel this way about art too so often

354
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,540
when we try to form opalescent art we

355
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,550
fall short so many times in my own work

356
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,560
I can see the individual silica spheres

357
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,710
but they aren't aligned they just form

358
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,500
another piece of opaque opal even when

359
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,930
they do align properly because of the

360
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,600
nature of the striving and yearning I'm

361
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,820
actually quite sure that they will never

362
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:31,510
align perfectly to make matters worse

363
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,550
the forming of opal requires a number of

364
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,740
spheres that is larger than what human

365
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,410
vision is made for more than our minds

366
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,440
can comprehend in the end we can tell if

367
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,930
an opal is precious but there are too

368
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,210
many parts too many conditions too many

369
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,720
unknowns to tell before it is form it's

370
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,460
a bit like how I work with computers I

371
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,740
can hold in my mind the movement of one

372
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,680
or even 10 particles but when it gets up

373
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,200
to 1 million that's pure white light

374
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,380
scale distant space bees scale it's not

375
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,939
human scale I can only guess compile and

376
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:13,480
witness the attempted formation in 8th

377
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,760
grade I took a Fame my family took a

378
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,949
trip to Nevada to go opal mining it had

379
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,900
been a dream of mine and after begging

380
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,000
my family for years we finally made the

381
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,560
trip to one of the only places in the

382
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,750
continental United States where precious

383
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,600
opals have formed royal peacock opal

384
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,000
mind it was a pretty sweet deal you pay

385
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,490
a set amount and break open pieces of

386
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,260
moist clay all day searching for those

387
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,090
precious points and possibility space

388
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,810
where the silica spheres have aligned

389
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,190
many people might consider it boring

390
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,350
sitting around staring at the saturated

391
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,200
clay maybe even painful the Sun beating

392
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,870
down crisping your flesh but i SAT there

393
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,179
smashing clay digging with a hand

394
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,999
pickaxe getting really really really

395
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:57,999
bored getting really frustrated even

396
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:00,730
hopeless I've been waiting so long for

397
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,610
this trip planning for preparing for it

398
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,379
the fact that I couldn't find a single

399
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:07,480
one of these opals was driving

400
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,299
me insane and it's at a sanity I know

401
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,460
all of you experienced trying to find

402
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,379
that one typo and thousands of lines of

403
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:16,869
code or for 3d artists when you spend

404
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:19,419
the entire day tweaking values for an

405
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,639
overnight render finally send off the

406
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:23,830
command in the next day when you come in

407
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,809
giddy with excitement to witness the

408
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:28,749
result it's just garbage you're

409
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:30,999
expecting something transcendent but

410
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,369
instead it's this vulgar catastrophe

411
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:35,139
like one of those images you would find

412
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:36,850
on the internet that you just can't

413
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:42,070
unsee and I never actually found an opal

414
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,799
that day my arms are sore my mind fried

415
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,720
from the heat days from too many hours

416
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,110
of manual labor and not enough water I

417
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,269
didn't find an opal that day but my mom

418
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:57,309
did oh my god my mom did and it was such

419
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:00,009
a miracle it was this deep translucent

420
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:02,619
brown flecks of green throughout it was

421
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:05,019
this pillar that just shown sparkled

422
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,749
contains so much in it even though it

423
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:10,450
was only the size of a pinkie it was so

424
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,749
rich complex and from one angle from

425
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:16,029
this one angle you could see this purple

426
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,519
this deep mysterious purple that flowed

427
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,049
through the rock like some sort of

428
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:24,820
Aurora so infinite but so small it was

429
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,100
such a melancholy emotion to look upon

430
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,860
the object that my mother had found its

431
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,419
honestly an emotion every time I watch a

432
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:33,730
really good film I feel so sad that he

433
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,499
didn't make it so sad that I could never

434
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:37,779
actually make it so sad they're hard

435
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,149
limits to my experience that there are

436
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:43,570
things which are impossible but what's

437
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,309
so much more important than that sadness

438
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,159
with the beauty of the opal that my

439
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,889
mother found the refracted so much light

440
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,600
pointing towards something so much more

441
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,879
and that light of the thing that

442
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:56,860
appointed for the life of the thing that

443
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:04,730
it pointed towards just

444
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,620
now this is where it starts to get weird

445
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,900
you see I found a mind that doesn't

446
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,880
require me begging my family to visit it

447
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,100
sits in my room attached to a monitor a

448
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,650
keyboard digital mining goggles and

449
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,590
digital handheld pickaxe every day I

450
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,900
wake up I grab my bed I prop it against

451
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,920
the wall to make more room for

452
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,410
excavation i turn on my computer turn on

453
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,630
my by vr headset turn on my hand

454
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,240
controllers and turn on my mind only of

455
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,250
course after copious amounts of coffee I

456
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,490
fight bugs Creek buffers contort code to

457
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,230
complete tasks my engine was not made to

458
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,300
complete I dig through forms for

459
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,100
crystallized keys that will unlock the

460
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,950
door into the next reality I spend days

461
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,530
hunting down off by one errors finding

462
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,330
the perfect normal map or the perfect

463
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,600
sound effect and sometimes just

464
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,480
sometimes I press play and in that

465
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,750
moment of error-free compilation reality

466
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,810
is ripped open and I'm there gazing upon

467
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,100
the newest island surfaced in space time

468
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,660
I've grown a bit accustomed to this

469
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,520
moment as i'm sure workers at the royal

470
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,620
peacock have grown accustomed to finding

471
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,930
opals I remember that first time that I

472
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,880
found something though I cried a little

473
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,160
at the simple beauty of the malleability

474
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,610
of reality but as I dug deeper I started

475
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,920
losing that childlike glee that wonder

476
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,740
that ah I forgot how mysterious it was

477
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,170
to create the rift from which infinity

478
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,460
poured then one night at about 3am I

479
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,310
changed the line of code press play and

480
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,950
discovered something I never expected to

481
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:46,300
find there was a creature living inside

482
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,940
my computer at first I couldn't believe

483
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,830
it I must have fallen asleep lost myself

484
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,020
in a dream world I stopped the program

485
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,000
took off my headset went on a midnight

486
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,860
walk trying to clear my head came back

487
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,960
started the program making sure that was

488
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,490
in exactly the same state as it was

489
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,480
before there it was again living in the

490
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,540
land of the immaterial breathing dancing

491
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,630
singing and all I could do was laugh

492
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,250
I've been telling myself that my view of

493
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,650
reality was so small that all like all

494
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,130
that

495
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,350
can be is more than all that is that

496
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,180
reality can expand into whatever our

497
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,190
minds make it but I had only been

498
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,040
telling myself this trying to convince

499
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,900
myself that there was actual magic in

500
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,540
the world I understood it conceptually I

501
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,700
didn't expect to be confronted with a

502
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,690
creature that proved it physically it

503
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,600
was so strange the emotion of being with

504
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,000
that creature it somehow felt like this

505
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,820
perpetual rainbow as the creature dance

506
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,280
that filled me with joy I felt alive I

507
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,890
fed it I touched by petted I played and

508
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,140
in that moment movement in that moment

509
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,830
the light emanated from me the creature

510
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,470
refracted this light completely sending

511
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,040
it sparkling unfolding before me it let

512
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,960
me look at the light that came from

513
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,570
within my own soul in a way that I could

514
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,580
comprehend and understand its

515
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,400
magnificent and seeing that magnificence

516
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,490
caused the light to grow as the

517
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,770
galloping beast undulated in front of me

518
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,530
I stood in this newly formed reality

519
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,450
sobbing it was so real that I couldn't

520
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,970
even stop the program it felt too unkind

521
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,820
to the creature to dance so freely but

522
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,800
only for that moment as I witnessed it

523
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,940
but finally when my goggles were too

524
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,000
fogged from tears I returned it was

525
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,130
pointless to try and sleep now the life

526
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,570
of the creature had breathed life into

527
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,810
me I walked down to lake merritt in all

528
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,730
of the world around me I bent down and

529
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,670
touched the grass listen to the birds

530
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,290
meditated on the soft lapping of the

531
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,870
water as I SAT there watching the gold

532
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,150
watch over the lake I remember that this

533
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,370
was how I felt after every story which

534
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,250
moved me they were lenses made from

535
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,410
lenses taking the light that was all

536
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,200
around me refract refracting it so

537
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
clearly that for a moment I could see

538
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,350
the light inside myself this creature I

539
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,790
discovered had been truly alive to me it

540
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,370
might not make others feel the same but

541
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,640
it did for me projecting that distant

542
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,980
space beast across the surface of my

543
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,970
mind showing me that I was part of it an

544
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,870
infinitely small part of it

545
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,480
a single silica sphere but no less

546
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,720
important no less light and even though

547
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,790
we will never see the whole thing we

548
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,860
will never make the whole thing will

549
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,350
never be the whole thing we can move

550
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,590
towards it and be move towards it slowly

551
00:24:44,590 --> 00:25:07,990
discovering our prismatic reality

552
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:16,530
is a lot of talking and real quick just

553
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,510
to talk about technology it's all using

554
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:25,440
a 3gs which is a WebGL library and it's

555
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,140
using this technique called GPGPU

556
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,690
physics simulation because your computer

557
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,970
is really good at telling you what

558
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,550
pixels to be certain colors but it

559
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,050
doesn't necessarily like JavaScript

560
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,670
isn't necessarily fast enough that it

561
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,080
wants to do a lot of physics but the

562
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,940
thing is is that you can get really good

563
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,620
at lying to your computer and being like

564
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,350
okay like I'm going to color a bunch of

565
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,580
things and your computer is like oh my

566
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,400
god I got this and then you take that

567
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,330
and you go just kidding RGB equals XY Z

568
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,810
I just made you do physics um yeah so

569
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:09,750
that's how it works thank you

570
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,130
programming is fun but deployment is not

571
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,860
so much fun this is when it comes to

572
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,870
making a project go live I found myself

573
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,520
constantly running into the same things

574
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,890
again and again I would zip up the

575
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,280
project copy remotely I would ssh into

576
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,320
the remote machine somewhere unzip it

577
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,929
run a setup script do a health check and

578
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:35,390
then repeat and it got to the point

579
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,640
where I just thought to myself what if I
