1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,160

you guys hear me yeah that's good okay

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,260
I'm gonna give a talk on how to rapidly

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,449
prototype with JavaScript but for

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,810
multiple devices multiple platforms

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,369
pretty pretty serious stuff so i'll

6
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,210
expect you to pay attention and you will

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:39,520
ask questions at the end you guys ready

8
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,710
are you guys ready all right I think you

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,050
guys are ready all right my name is Joe

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,690
McCann i work at frog design in the

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,910
united states in austin texas home of

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,910
this dickhead i work at a company we do

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,460
a lot of innovation work so we do it's

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,659
probably a lot of stuff that you never

15
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,510
see or if you do see we can't claim it

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,630
it's kind of sucks for me but it's fun

17
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,009
fun stuff we work on we work

18
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,280
predominantly with Fortune 500 companies

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,040
like hewlett-packard and disney and

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,210
other companies i can't really mention

21
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,200
unfortunately but we get to do really

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
cool stuff and since i've been working

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,990
that i've been trying to integrate using

24
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,680
javascript instead of things like WPF

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,170
cutie like that

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,070
so so what would you say rapid

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,359
prototyping is anybody have a clue

28
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,399
thanks captain obvious all right yeah

29
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,700
it's fast right for sure so a more sort

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,950
of formalized discretion oh by the way

31
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,390
let me back up for a second before i

32
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,680
define rapid prototyping I will be

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,170
talking about rapid prototyping tools to

34
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,179
use it and then i'll be showing some

35
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,290
demos at the end so they're prototypes

36
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,620
so if they break no big deal rapid

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,720
prototyping it's an extension of the

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,760
design process it's highly iterative

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,730
highly collaborative it allows you to

40
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,390
test earlier for cheap so one of the

41
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,670
biggest advantages to rapid prototyping

42
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,840
is say you have six weeks to do a

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,340
project and you have to work with a

44
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,450
project manager a biz dev guy a couple

45
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,890
of designers and then you've got to

46
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,480
implement it of course what happens is

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,250
five weeks goes by and then you get a

48
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,049
week to implement it typically that's

49
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:50,100
what happens at a lot of places

50
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,400
unfortunately so JavaScript lousy what

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,230
i'll be showing is how JavaScript will

52
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,380
enable you do that fast and actually be

53
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,420
able to work with the designer side by

54
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,940
side so there's a reduction or an

55
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,190
elimination of design artifacts and what

56
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,630
our design artifacts what I mean by that

57
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,019
is a designer makes a design emails you

58
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,170
of ping or a PSD you get to go implement

59
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,640
it and then the designer sends you a

60
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,140
revision and you get to go make the

61
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,910
changes in back and forth rapid

62
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,430
prototype allows you to sit right next

63
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,410
to the designer and just be building

64
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,920
while they're doing so it's pretty sweet

65
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,620
so in a nutshell rapid prototyping is

66
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,910
taking a concept or an idea with a very

67
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,959
short amount of time with design and

68
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:42,480
development associated with that other

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,840
words for rapid prototyping research and

70
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,230
development and labs groups so there are

71
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,650
small companies that have labs groups

72
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,640
R&D group

73
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,030
these types of things and a lot of the

74
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,069
times you may never even see what these

75
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,660
prototypes are in production but that's

76
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,880
kind of a concept there's an exploration

77
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,310
and discovery phase you just kind of

78
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,840
want to see what's available what's out

79
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,160
there but labs groups specifically there

80
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,780
are some companies that have been able

81
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,060
to take the concept of building out

82
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,870
prototypes and utilizing them for

83
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,480
production ready applications what have

84
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,060
you one company that's really good at

85
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,810
this is google which this was perfect

86
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,400
i'm in the google room so this is

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,720
awesome they they've actually had they

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,820
have the i think the twenty percent time

89
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,830
so i think one day a week get to kind of

90
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,320
build on whatever smart folks then

91
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,230
google owns all the IP and so for

92
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,310
examples of things that google's created

93
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:57,330
our google news gmail google adsense and

94
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,630
orkut now all these are public face

95
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,880
saying people mainly know about these

96
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,320
these four things and there are other

97
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,640
ones but i'm sure there are ones that

98
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,750
never hit production or things that

99
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,830
they've shut down all together like wave

100
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,000
how the good thing there to deploy here

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,060
is rapid prototyping is not just hey i

102
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,800
got this crazy idea and i want to use

103
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,250
node and CouchDB and whatever else and

104
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,479
just slap it together and see what i can

105
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,090
do there's actual real business value

106
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,330
behind this and that's big when you're

107
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,890
talking with clients about the purpose

108
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,979
and the concept behind rapid prototyping

109
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,039
for example finally I can actually

110
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,830
mention this HP is releasing I don't

111
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,150
know if anybody's seen it HP has a

112
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,100
touchscreen computer called touchsmart

113
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,440
it's about about the size of a small TV

114
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,660
it's touch screen and it's a normal

115
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,539
computer we did some rapid prototyping

116
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,820
for them and they just launched it I

117
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,070
think this past week so it's good timing

118
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,810
for me but the rapid prototyping work

119
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,610
may or may not actually ship you just

120
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,470
don't know the point is that there's an

121
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,630
exploration that enables you to be able

122
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,980
to put this stuff in a production

123
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,450
environment and then hopefully be able

124
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,350
to ship it however like I've mentioned a

125
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,130
lot of the business use cases will

126
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,080
actually go unseen and that's why it's

127
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,260
called a prototype a prototype again for

128
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,639
those you may have never built

129
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,220
prototypes they don't have to be

130
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,889
production-ready they can be they can be

131
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:31,930
quite I don't know rigid and robust but

132
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,729
at the same time they can they can break

133
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:35,830
very easily it's okay one of the things

134
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,979
that we also like to do is create a

135
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:41,410
fairly consistent user flow and we're

136
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,540
not talking about catching every edge

137
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,700
case we may be called the happy path

138
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,860
where you just go through these steps

139
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,660
and you show the different screens and

140
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,580
the interactions and the design and it

141
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,919
works and that's what we shoot for with

142
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,380
a prototype so like I said Google is

143
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,180
doing these types of things there are

144
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,100
other companies doing these types of

145
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,870
things there's a company in Austin Texas

146
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,539
where I live call bazaarvoice they have

147
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:07,690
a labs group and they're actually doing

148
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,050
very well with with this model one of

149
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,120
the other big advantages to rapid

150
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,080
prototyping is that you can do it fairly

151
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,930
cheap so if you have six four six eight

152
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,479
weeks to build something out you don't

153
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,789
have to go and hire a full enterprise

154
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:26,919
level engineering team and a stack of

155
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:28,630
interaction designers and a stack of

156
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,090
visual designers you can actually do it

157
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,490
with a fairly small team excuse me

158
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,370
fairly quickly so the key is that rapid

159
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,979
prototyping is basically innovating very

160
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,850
very cheaply so at this point I think I

161
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,400
think an example would help so while I

162
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,830
was preparing this talk last week I

163
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,360
wanted to think like you no min I was in

164
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,100
Amsterdam last week knew I was coming to

165
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,690
Berlin I'm going to Stockholm next week

166
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,450
for Android only I don't speak any of

167
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,750
those languages so what could I do what

168
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,880
could I what could I build quickly that

169
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,740
would enable me to you know be able to

170
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,659
speak so I wrote this language

171
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:10,030
translation app

172
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,700
and it's I like it's pretty cool I've

173
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,790
actually used it and basically way it

174
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,240
does it's called lingua and basically

175
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,790
what it does it allows you to input a

176
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,330
string or phrase and translate it into

177
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,860
the language of your choice and it uses

178
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,370
a number of free tools and techniques

179
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,380
that are out there and I'll show a

180
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,320
little bit of that in the demos so then

181
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,690
I was thinking myself okay how would I

182
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,040
actually get this from a client so

183
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,690
typically a client may come in and they

184
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,130
will say hey we need this really awesome

185
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,140
you know device this this really killer

186
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,780
translation app to work on the you know

187
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,840
the ipad or the you know and a mobile

188
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,170
browser so you figure yourself how do i

189
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,390
do this sort of thing and that's what i

190
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,270
applied to the lingua I was thinking

191
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,920
look what device is what I actually want

192
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,190
to put this on and I thought where am I

193
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,390
going to be using this thing than most

194
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,630
so so I have a nexus one and this has a

195
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,700
mobile browser on it but then I may be

196
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,770
on my computer so why not make it a web

197
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,590
app right so I'm putting it on multiple

198
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,420
devices and that's that's the key is how

199
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,280
do we wrap a prototype for multiple

200
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,840
devices specifically a desktop browser

201
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,350
mobile browser native desktop app and a

202
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,810
native Android app so think about that

203
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,640
you need a desktop browser version a

204
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,520
mobile browser version a native desktop

205
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,580
app so it works on windows 7 mac linux

206
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,700
and a native android app just these are

207
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,340
your parameters can seem pretty daunting

208
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,610
if you weren't able to use javascript if

209
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,200
you could not use JavaScript you

210
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,350
probably thinking to yourself am I

211
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:09,100
going to do but we can use JavaScript

212
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,779
pretty sweet so because we can use

213
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,360
javascript we can we we don't get so

214
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,449
overwhelmed drink a lot of coffee and we

215
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,730
get going right but in order to really

216
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,980
start to make this this work and really

217
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,049
start to happen you're going to need

218
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,569
tools to do it and so I was thinking

219
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:30,139
myself what tools do i actually need to

220
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,639
make this work and I said all right well

221
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,790
have a web app version and me a desktop

222
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,769
app version only and native Android app

223
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,949
I don't know all that stuff so I just

224
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:43,709
need to actually use javascript and HTML

225
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,989
and CSS and some other things that I'm

226
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:49,290
familiar with right the first thing no

227
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:55,230
Jess all right um I'm not going to go

228
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,259
into how how awesome this is

229
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:59,100
because if you don't know you should

230
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,389
probably be at home coloring right now I

231
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:08,399
use Express and connect it's not so much

232
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,699
because you know these are what these

233
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:13,230
are the best or anything like that I use

234
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,629
them mainly because number one you've

235
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,519
got really smart people working

236
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,689
behind them and two I believe the guys

237
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,790
that are working on these projects I

238
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,369
work at a company that's pretty well

239
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:29,669
funded to fund this project to make this

240
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:32,699
happen so you maybe have you may have

241
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:34,110
your own little framework and you've got

242
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,149
a full-time job well if your full-time

243
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:37,889
job is to work on that framework you're

244
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:38,939
probably going to get a lot more out of

245
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:41,519
it so i select express and connect it's

246
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,610
pretty pretty simple stuff so that

247
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,139
helped me set up all the server side

248
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:50,669
component for the desktop client Reeves

249
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,919
appcelerator titanium is anybody

250
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,790
familiar with titanium wow really all

251
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,019
right so this is going to be sweet then

252
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,319
okay so appcelerator titanium enables

253
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,779
you to write desktop and mobile but I

254
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,850
use it for desktop desktop and mobile

255
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,049
apps using HTML CSS and JavaScript so

256
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:12,509
they've extracted all the low level

257
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:14,669
stuff and just expose it in JavaScript

258
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:16,030
API it's really nice

259
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,270
you get file i/o access notifications

260
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,130
like system beeps and that sort of stuff

261
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,740
and I'll show this in the demo here

262
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,400
shortly next of course phonegap anybody

263
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,730
have a phone yet really even after

264
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,670
brian's talk half the room are you guys

265
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,980
that tired you can't raise your hand

266
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,630
alright so phone gasps pretty sweet it's

267
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,170
it's similar to similar but different to

268
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,540
the titanium model where they abstract

269
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,520
away a lot of the underlying mess with

270
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,110
Objective C and Java and the other

271
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,910
underlying languages for the mobile

272
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,330
platforms and expose JavaScript API s so

273
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,040
it allows you to do the same sort of

274
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,990
thing you use the camera use native

275
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,820
notifications vibrate all that sort of

276
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,520
thing it's pretty nice and then I

277
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,310
thought myself what about what I'm what

278
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,430
about when I'm actually I don't have an

279
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,080
internet connection what am I going to

280
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,410
do on a mobile device and I'm in you

281
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,410
know a club in Berlin and I really gotta

282
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,210
go use the bathroom and I'm underground

283
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,850
and my phone doesn't work well Cal chibi

284
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,280
is really sweet because you can dump a

285
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,080
lot of stuff in the cloud somewhere

286
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,820
that's the simplest way of putting it

287
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,980
and then that stuff can actually get

288
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,990
dumped to whatever is hooked up to that

289
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,210
it's about as simple as explanation as I

290
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,700
can give and it essentially allows for

291
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,970
offline data sync which is really really

292
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,700
cool and really big I can't emphasize

293
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,400
that enough I think the the couchdb you

294
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,690
guys really really know what they're

295
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,160
doing with the offline data sync stuff

296
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,740
it's gonna be big next year for sure but

297
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,680
I needed to have a database big enough

298
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,880
to have a ton of already translated

299
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,720
phrases and words potentially and I use

300
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,390
YQL to do that so YQL anybody familiar

301
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,990
with yql ok not bad about a third of the

302
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:13,240
room yql try to keep this simple it

303
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,890
basically makes the entire web a

304
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,950
gigantic API so for example it does you

305
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,430
can use things like screen scraping and

306
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,089
any website and you can request it the

307
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,339
response to be in Jason and it makes

308
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,300
being able to say parse an entire

309
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,040
website and grab little bits of

310
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,170
information out of it very very easily

311
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,220
and I'll show I'll show a demo of how to

312
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,610
use YQL it's dead simple and it's Tom in

313
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,010
the room if he's not yeah Tom's like the

314
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,690
white white call guru so ask him all

315
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,959
your questions not me so what about the

316
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,360
UI we've got multiple devices we've got

317
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,310
multiple devices multiple screen

318
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,850
resolutions multiple platforms we figure

319
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,930
out how to handle that with JavaScript

320
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,649
right how do you design a layout or a UI

321
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,040
for all these devices with with just one

322
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,279
index HTML file well the first thing and

323
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,510
if you don't take away anything from

324
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,670
this talk please take away this from the

325
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,649
talk is that you should not be designing

326
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,250
for a specific device I repeat you

327
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,990
should not be designing for a specific

328
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,450
device you should be designing for

329
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,520
flexible you I something that can

330
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,470
actually change based on media queries

331
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,190
and media queries do you guys know that

332
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:41,459
is anybody CSS media queries so CSS

333
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,230
media queries loud that you I to change

334
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,690
and flex based on certain properties of

335
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,510
the UI and I think this make more sense

336
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,910
if I just end up showing your demo so Oh

337
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:59,570
first you can go here and play along

338
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,959
this is running on node so and i'm not a

339
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,300
server-side guy so if it crashes it's my

340
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,740
fault not nodes fault so go here you can

341
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,329
actually pull this up on by the way i

342
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:13,650
only tested this in google chrome

343
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,570
because it's a prototype so if you pull

344
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,200
it up in IE or firefox i have no idea

345
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,240
what looks like to be frank the other

346
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,649
thing is you can also pull it up on a

347
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,150
mobile brown

348
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,890
that doesn't suck so specifically iphone

349
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,780
the too big let's see can you guys see

350
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:41,070
that probably not huh alright so you may

351
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,650
not be able to read very well because

352
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,300
the text or can you guys now you can't

353
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,670
see that at all so if you excuse me

354
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,860
thank you so all right he did the demo

355
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,400
for me I'm moving on no um so so let's

356
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,760
so one of the things that I needed to be

357
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,140
able to translate when I was in

358
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,209
Amsterdam was where the coffee shop was

359
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:07,709
that's pretty sure I was going to need

360
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,110
to know how to do that so it's pretty

361
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,520
straightforward you put put something in

362
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,550
and you get translations so there's

363
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,900
there's all kinds of languages to choose

364
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,480
from all right what else we could pay

365
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,700
aquare we're in Germany looking to you

366
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,170
German same thing pretty sweet it's

367
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,270
probably is that wrong that's totally

368
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,900
wrong right well you can blame google

369
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,600
for that i'm using google's translation

370
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,120
api so i didn't write some amazing

371
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,380
translation thing i'm actually just

372
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,580
using their api so cool right but let's

373
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,230
let's let's show you what the media

374
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:51,690
queries actually will do you guys see

375
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,000
the UI change there it's the same

376
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,200
codebase same CSS file and it's

377
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,000
immediately being formatted for mogul so

378
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,520
if you pull it up on a mobile device

379
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,880
you'll get that the cool thing is you

380
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,640
can actually do stuff like this and then

381
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,740
when we flex it back out it goes back it

382
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,240
retains the state but you have to know

383
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,500
how to do that in JavaScript that

384
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,420
doesn't get handled with media queries

385
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:31,110
ok so moving on native desktop app this

386
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,840
is going to be the apps elevator up

387
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,150
so you can see here lingua app this is

388
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,860
now I'm not making this up different to

389
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,540
you I chromeless it's kind of cool let's

390
00:18:48,540 --> 00:19:10,400
do it nice for now let's build it oh yes

391
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,270
yeah alright it works so that was a

392
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,770
system notification that was not me

393
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,210
embedding some wave file and it

394
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,690
triggering that's the the native beat

395
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,020
that I had set on on this mac so

396
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,610
absolutely allow you to build it for mac

397
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,620
linux and windows from the same codebase

398
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,720
pretty sweet so now you've got it

399
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,150
running out as a widget appcelerator

400
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,549
also uses webkit so you're going to get

401
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,610
the same sort of bonuses from it right

402
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:42,890
oh oh by the way so for the next demo

403
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,630
I'll show yql but if you have an Android

404
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,169
device you can download excuse me you

405
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:51,580
can download the apk and install

406
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,230
directly and you'll have it running on

407
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,049
your phone we'll get to that in a second

408
00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:08,049
so yql action yeesh that was not a

409
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:14,840
translation alright

410
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,710
just checking okay so here we started

411
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,140
off that should look pretty familiar to

412
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,940
anybody at ease node and what we're

413
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,380
going to do is we're going to make sure

414
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,850
that the server works and then we're

415
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,470
going to connect to couch 1 whereas all

416
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,150
the translations are stored and then

417
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,040
we're going to run the YQL script to

418
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,140
translate all the headlines in the New

419
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,600
York Times right now into Dutch and

420
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:44,500
store them in couch and you'll notice

421
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,179
here it's just updating a timestamp

422
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:47,860
because I ran this an hour ago and the

423
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,320
headlines haven't changed but it's

424
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,760
headlines were different or if there are

425
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,720
different words that were going to

426
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,190
translate it it would be storing it

427
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,100
directly in couch so I can build a

428
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,410
massive database really quickly with yql

429
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,300
the other thing is cool the way I wrote

430
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,670
it is i can actually add say ten minutes

431
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,090
and it'll in early every 10 minutes and

432
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,230
just start grabbing new ones and

433
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,940
populating that database so if you need

434
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,100
a big data set yq o will enable you to

435
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,500
do that really really easily and then of

436
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,570
course you can dump it in couch over

437
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,960
HTTP which is also pretty sweet okay

438
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,450
next demo native android app so this is

439
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,070
going to be hard because I don't have a

440
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,390
document camera so you won't be able to

441
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,940
see it but you'll have to either install

442
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,080
it on an Android device huh photo good

443
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:52,470
that's new

444
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,890
alright we're not going to do that so a

445
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,130
totally impressive results thanks guys

446
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,270
so I've got the native app here you

447
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,530
can't see it unless you're sitting

448
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,630
really close but is the native app and

449
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,670
to show you that it's native and I'm not

450
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,310
pulling up the browser if it works that

451
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,280
if the prototype works it will vibrate

452
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,320
and beep there you go so we're actually

453
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,360
yay the demo gods don't hate me today

454
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,360
but we're online right there so big deal

455
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,920
right let's do the a flight access so

456
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,320
now I'm going to go into airplane mode

457
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,720
and by the way this does require couchdb

458
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,140
to be installed on your Android device

459
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,780
reload lingua can you verify that we're

460
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,780
in airplane mode music can you say that

461
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,890
again yes I can't ok good so we're in

462
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,410
offline mode so if the demo gods don't

463
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,970
hate me they'll allow this to work as

464
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,350
well we're going to translate the same

465
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,240
thing we're offline mode and we should

466
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,820
hear a beep and that's the guy works on

467
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,640
couch so he must be really stoked ok so

468
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,940
we've got an app that works on all these

469
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,670
different platforms and devices i will

470
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,680
show you really quick i'm not one for

471
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,450
really showing code during talks i don't

472
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,160
people want to see it but i think one of

473
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,110
the things that's important to check out

474
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,100
let's see i want you to see how i have

475
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,290
this setup it's in the directory

476
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:39,329
structure so if you'll look

477
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:42,320
here I've got my android client my

478
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,079
desktop client and all my time I bill

479
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,239
kind of an you probably already know

480
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,679
about this but it's something we're

481
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:50,929
sharing because it makes deploying and

482
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,239
testing on multiple versions really easy

483
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:56,799
to do it this way so it's pretty sweet

484
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:03,559
right so what we learned today you can

485
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,469
wrap a prototype on multiple platforms

486
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:08,869
for multiple devices really easily using

487
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:10,700
javascript and of course you can design

488
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,089
flexible use UI is using HTML CSS CSS

489
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:17,719
media queries pretty cool stuff couple

490
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:19,609
that with open source projects like

491
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:22,159
CouchDB and nodejs Google Translation

492
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,599
API I believe I used Mike's request

493
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,779
jayus which is HT client my rocks

494
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:31,700
translate digest and I think Andrew

495
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,919
Lonnie worked on that it's all open

496
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,389
source stuff that I'm dumping here and

497
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:38,959
it works it's pretty cool yeah and you

498
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,820
can you can check out my stuff will be

499
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,169
dumping a lot of this code if not all of

500
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,820
it on github so you can have it and do

501
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,769
whatever you want with it and then i'm

502
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:50,659
on twitter as well so questions you will

503
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:54,310
ask questions

504
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:23,020
or it gets the hose I don't remember yes

505
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,980
say excellent question so the question

506
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,170
is why did I choose titanium for

507
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,930
something and phonegap for another very

508
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,170
simple titanium mobile which you can

509
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,060
build iphone android apps etc I think

510
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,410
blackberries and the pipe as well for

511
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,810
them they require to do it all in

512
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,910
JavaScript so your UI and everything

513
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,640
which is not bad but I still like to be

514
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,490
able to work out of an index.html

515
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,810
titanium desktop allows you to still use

516
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,570
HTML CSS and JavaScript so you can still

517
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,790
lay out your UI with an HTML CSS and

518
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,000
it's good to go phonegap allows you to

519
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,160
do and index HTML as well so again I'm

520
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,510
just working out of one directory and

521
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,800
being able to target two different

522
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,080
platforms and that was the sort of

523
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,400
tipping factor there of why I went that

524
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,050
route that's to keep them coming let's

525
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,950
go really

526
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:25,340
you

527
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,610
now look how cool that was man

528
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,710
that's no way it's actually pretty

529
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,720
pretty pretty sweet when you can deliver

530
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,040
a really cool prototype that they can

531
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,480
see on multiple platforms and devices

532
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,550
and say that they want to target one

533
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,260
device and you show them like pay by the

534
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,030
way if we go this route we can put it on

535
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,490
all of these that's way cheaper than

536
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,410
doing it with four sets of developers

537
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,570
four sets of designers etc so yeah it's

538
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,970
actually I don't do the biz dev stuff

539
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,680
but that's one of the upselling factors

540
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,900
right now with using the HTM the web

541
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,430
tech stack as a software platform to

542
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:13,869
make sense

543
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:18,119
and the simple answer to that question

544
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,149
is it's a prototype seriously I mean

545
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:22,379
it's fundamental as that sounds that's

546
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:23,970
the biggest thing is that hey we've

547
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,539
rigged this to work potentially right so

548
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:32,639
that it shows you the user flow that

549
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:34,379
we've outlined that you've agreed to

550
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:36,990
client and then when they say yeah but

551
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,119
if we want this you you already have it

552
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,519
built let's just go to production no no

553
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,899
that's cost a lot more money and then

554
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:52,070
you you know bill them more anybody else
