00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,280

my name is Thomas on troop I'm working

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,560
40 I'm currently living in Seattle but

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,010
I'm

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,110
originally from Poland I'm focusing on

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,000
back-end systems mostly and for the past

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,290
few years I've been working a lot with

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,830
no Jas so I spent a lot of time working

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,260
on cloud computing software for

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,489
microsoft and HP for my last few years

10
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,739
of Microsoft I we need to signal jas

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,590
into the Microsoft ecosystem after I

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,300
left Microsoft I stayed with no Jas and

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,460
I continue that work with 0 of 0 right

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,340
now I talk was about sandboxing know Jas

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,610
code which is a topic relevant for

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,720
anyone who's building a multi-tenant

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,449
system that executes custom code on

18
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,760
users we have I think there are few

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,650
interesting trends in technology over

20
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,030
the past couple of years and you are

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,790
only going to see more of it one is the

22
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,030
entire software landscape getting more

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,370
polyglot before using more languages and

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,890
more technologies over time also the

25
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,049
barrier to entry is getting smaller and

26
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,790
smaller one thing I know to one

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,320
interesting thing I noticed he not zero

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,970
is how many external systems we are

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,159
using to deliver our service it's about

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,700
50 external components so software

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,020
development going forward I think will

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,490
be mostly about putting together

33
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,800
existing building blocks and gluing them

34
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,560
together rather than huge infrastructure

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,170
investments section my second time in

36
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,630
Buenos Aires I've into a month ago now I

37
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,120
love this place is very it reminds me of

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,060
my home country of Poland study similar

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,530
in many respects of course this is a

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,020
different hemisphere so for me

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,420
personally coming from snowy Seattle

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,240
right now it's a nice change I've always

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,660
liked like Jess conferences they're just

44
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,640
different from from all the other

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,380
conferences I've been to I mean at three

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,210
J's conferences in the reigning in the

47
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,730
US and here in Venice iris and there is

48
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,590
a common theme theme running through all

49
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,650
of them people are just coming to learn
