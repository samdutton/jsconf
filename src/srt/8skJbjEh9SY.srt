1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:21,400

Oh

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,610
you

3
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,980
so let me shortly introduce myself I'm

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,690
Michael biniak and I'm senior front-end

5
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,600
developer in inner games and I'm working

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,690
grepolis game it so let me short really

7
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,120
shortly introduce to grapple this game

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,450
what is it few short facts so it's

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,370
browser based strategy game which is set

10
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,980
in ancient Greece there is open twenty

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,930
million registered users it's translated

12
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,600
to 22 languages and I think what is more

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,760
important that all front end is done in

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,879
just craved HTML and CSS and we are

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,980
using some newest features from html5

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,370
like a history API we are using audio

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,240
obviously and canvas and of course css3

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,250
so like transitions or animations and

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,850
yeah so let's go back to presentation

20
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,590
what is the plan for today at the very

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,110
beginning I would like to show you or do

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,400
short introduction what our earliest

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,900
prides afterwards how we are using sound

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,940
in grepolis game and what is our case

25
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,010
though afterwards few words about

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,660
preparation how the files should look

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,760
like and what is important during when

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,900
we are merging them into one afterwards

29
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,950
some tests about more users view and

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,430
file size and short summary at the end

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,820
all right so what our audio sprites let

32
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,730
me explain how to look like starting

33
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,430
with image sprites which I so it's quite

34
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,430
usual for everyone that everyone knows

35
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,920
what is it so we are merging multiple

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,500
files into one file and afterwards to

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,700
get immediate access to it and well to

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,980
use that we usually are using CSS rules

39
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,739
so we can be somehow pixel perfect so we

40
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,360
are minimizing the space between them

41
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,280
somehow with the rectangles around it ya

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,440
Abdul sprycel almost the same however

43
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,940
the color is a little bit different it

44
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,180
sounds so we are merging sound different

45
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,129
sounds into one yep well actually we

46
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:38,740
can't be pixel perfect

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,370
the we are here using time so it's also

48
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,200
hard to be millisecond perfect as in

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,080
depends of the hardware but so then we

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,790
have to separate different files by

51
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,660
silence and afterwards we are using time

52
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,610
update event to handle when the sound

53
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,760
should stop in this one huge file and of

54
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,740
course we then using each set of CSS

55
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,310
rules Sam Jessie J's config so JSON or

56
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,040
XML it so let's do a short presentation

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,350
how we are using it in ripple each game

58
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,500
I think I have it open here already yep

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,970
so this is gray Polly's game it's a

60
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,070
little bit cut maybe make it a little

61
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:37,410
bit smaller just to get it's fine now

62
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,959
yeah so we can we advert beginning we

63
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,829
have some cities here so let's start it

64
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,799
so and and this city the goal of the

65
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,780
game is to conquer all island at the

66
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,269
beginning and afterwards to conquer a

67
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:02,660
whore word so it's a little big yeah and

68
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,190
if you wanted to convert the word we can

69
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,350
do it alone or yeah we can use it to

70
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,120
together with others to set up some

71
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,049
alliances and so on and I think what is

72
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:16,880
the most important part to conquer are

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,630
the our army or units and so we have to

74
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,820
somehow recruit them and we can do it in

75
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,900
the city overview it's a little bit I

76
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,020
think too loud may be great to do yeah

77
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,539
it's internet here is working quite not

78
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,470
well

79
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:52,380
yeah all right that's right it seems it

80
00:04:52,380 --> 00:05:02,519
try to restart

81
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:15,239
yeah live demo all right on your back

82
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:18,459
try to open it again yeah now we are

83
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,669
here yeah and if we wanted to recruit

84
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:26,769
you needs we have to go to barracks and

85
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,299
as we can see here we have a lot of

86
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:30,669
different units which we catch which we

87
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,739
can recruit so let's say we recruit the

88
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:38,649
first one yep and then we have to wait

89
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,279
till the end of the recreation process

90
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,629
the other staff when we wanted to for

91
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,269
example to get different technologies

92
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:47,709
different units we have to go to the

93
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:53,079
academic and get to start to accent or

94
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,399
to research new technologies also few

95
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,859
other staff to manage God's to manage

96
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,859
out right and so on such we can notice

97
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:05,079
here we are playing a lot of short sound

98
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,389
effects to different buildings to

99
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,629
different units and they are playing

100
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:12,399
somehow in the different sound set for

101
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,709
each window or 40 each view so let me

102
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:27,999
shortly introduce or summary what we

103
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:31,269
have there so what we wanted to play our

104
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:33,879
short audio files they are playing

105
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,859
somehow separately at least according to

106
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:38,799
the Sun sets and we are not going to

107
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,069
loop it and our goals in the group

108
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,109
bollocks game where to make as fast

109
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:47,829
installation installation as possible we

110
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:49,779
also wanted to split the sound set

111
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,729
because we wanted to represent on them

112
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:53,349
and just to not use whole bandwidth of

113
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:54,819
the userid liver beginning of the game

114
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,759
and we also wanted to deliver to I 9

115
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,549
users as many sounds as possible or like

116
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:03,249
to other browsers because we met some

117
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:06,399
limitations with 40 LD players created

118
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,149
at once and as the game is over 150

119
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:11,190
sounds then

120
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:17,010
this was a little bit hard yeah so let's

121
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,300
start with some JavaScript this is

122
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,010
example of the config yeah so we have to

123
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,020
just pass when the sound starts and when

124
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,030
air when the ends this is actually

125
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,490
current example from the police games so

126
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,680
the prepared name is the idea of the

127
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,870
sound afterwards we have ID of the sound

128
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,570
sprite and then when it starts so the

129
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,490
first one at zero second and ends at

130
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,540
three seconds 75 and as we can notice

131
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,640
here this breaks between different

132
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,290
sounds are two seconds on the next one

133
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:51,480
starting at 575 yeah what's the idea of

134
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,670
implementation and this actually ropa

135
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:58,560
for the audio element that we are here

136
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
playing just fragment of it we are

137
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,670
passing this fragment from our config

138
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,580
and so at the very beginning we are just

139
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,400
setting the current time from the start

140
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,440
property from the fragment then

141
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,200
assigning even listener time update to

142
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,310
so our callback function and we are

143
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,470
starting playing sound yeah and on every

144
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,630
take of time update which should we take

145
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,550
at least once in 250 milliseconds

146
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,040
according to specification we are

147
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,710
checking if we already reached the end

148
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,590
of our sound which is set in config and

149
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,419
if so then we are just stopping it and

150
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,360
then we can do some reset of it and set

151
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,910
some extra states as we already said few

152
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,200
words about the silence between

153
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,700
different sounds with merge into one

154
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,110
yeah we have to summon determine what is

155
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,430
the optimal vows this is important

156
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,589
because this also some make impact to

157
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,400
the file size and this time updates

158
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,140
whistling said that it should be trigger

159
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,660
at least once in 250 milliseconds but if

160
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,810
is there's something going on the

161
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,700
background like game with some

162
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,420
animations and we are running it on

163
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,769
mobiles then it could be triggered

164
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,689
a little bit less often so we can reach

165
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:25,420
summing over one second so if you wanted

166
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,189
to avoid some glitches we have to differ

167
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:30,489
mine or our devices what will be the

168
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:34,300
perfect house and as we can notice on

169
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,779
the graph on the bottom the file size of

170
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,860
it is not really a different usually we

171
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,410
can oh no GG we can always make hip

172
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,230
smaller files Matty mp3's somehow a

173
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,839
little bit worse especially with

174
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,989
compressing the silence it was important

175
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:55,089
when we are compressing files which

176
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:57,790
always should use vb air so for a bit

177
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,009
rate because it's compressing silence

178
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:03,850
really well yeah if we wanted to hip

179
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,799
numbers here's comparison other sprites

180
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,319
to separate files so as you can notice

181
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:12,850
the OGG is always almost eight person

182
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,360
better the mp3 is a little bit worse and

183
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,119
it's anyway growing instantly linear

184
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,959
rate about eight percent on every jump

185
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,720
of the second the Emperor is a little

186
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,040
bit smaller but it's not huge issue yeah

187
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,629
let's move to the tests on the browser's

188
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,519
we tasted memory usage in spears edge

189
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,559
for them and we tested the newest chrome

190
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,379
the newest Firefox and a little bit

191
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,360
older Internet Explorer which is

192
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,790
actually most popular and some

193
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,889
independent values like size of the

194
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:52,540
files and number of requests yep this is

195
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,709
a full list of the Sun sprites used in

196
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:59,949
our game in grepolis game and as we

197
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:02,259
notice some of these some surprise are

198
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:05,529
bigger some are smaller but even if we

199
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,740
can save one of your every player of the

200
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,509
element for internet explorer I think

201
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:17,350
this is worth it and I tested memoria in

202
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,480
cpu usage on two cases one is great

203
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,129
police case so somehow we are playing

204
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:24,809
one side up one sound after another and

205
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,350
the edge case which are also prepared

206
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,569
it's ten sent at once so we are trying

207
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:33,970
to play all of these sounds this

208
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,829
moment and then we need to note only

209
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,470
this one on two other elements to

210
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,879
handling some sprites but we have to

211
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,250
create extra one so then we can notice

212
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,410
some issues and I tested it on two data

213
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,779
sets one on barracks which I already

214
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,759
shown and academy as well yep so as you

215
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,470
can notice Memorial usage for a great

216
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,339
police case it's really good for the

217
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,230
sound sprites we are saving a lot of

218
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,110
memory especially because of audio

219
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,579
elements so it's like twice smaller and

220
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,420
yep a little bit different is for 10

221
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,100
sounds at once our escape as we can

222
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,810
notice if you have to create more algae

223
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,060
elements which are handling bigger files

224
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,660
more usage will be way bigger so I think

225
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,240
in games like counter-strike where we

226
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,220
have a lot of explosions or something we

227
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:36,040
can think about other solution talking

228
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,199
about Maury I would also like to show

229
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,360
you the difference between what we get

230
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,819
the more usage when we enable sounds and

231
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:44,290
we are just creating out the elements

232
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,529
and after we play them so integral

233
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,870
politics case we can notice that if the

234
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,550
percentage comparison it's almost the

235
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,529
same for the sprites and for the

236
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:59,339
separate sounds so nothing really

237
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,689
interesting but for the ten cents at

238
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:03,100
once when we are creating a lot of new

239
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,829
of the elements the difference from the

240
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:08,139
beginning and the afterwards it's really

241
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:11,259
huge so we can be surprised afterwards

242
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,720
that the more you is so big and what we

243
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,100
have to do with that and handle all

244
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,350
these additional audio Clemens cpu usage

245
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,680
for sounds are usually it's usually not

246
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,250
no problem it's about health person of

247
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,050
CP usage when we are playing one sound

248
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,350
the pics here which we can notice it's

249
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,629
like only when we are setting current

250
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:36,759
time for so we are starting the new

251
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,470
audio sprite part it's of course

252
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,750
different for 10 sound at once when at

253
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,220
the beginning we are creating the new

254
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,559
audio elements and we are trying to set

255
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,540
them

256
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,829
as you can notice at the beginning is a

257
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,199
huge pig so for example chrome was using

258
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,009
almost whole accord running it and

259
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,540
afterwards anyway this p usage is like

260
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,689
ten percent so it's really big and

261
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,339
especially comparing two mobiles where

262
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:05,169
we are trying to run it and we don't

263
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:09,399
have so much yet operation per second it

264
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,790
could be a little bit problem on the

265
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,769
firefox we can only notice that these

266
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:19,059
jumps for the time update handling it

267
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,639
the last week which we tested our size

268
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:25,839
of files so we i already spoil it the

269
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,709
OGG is smaller usually always mp3 it's

270
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,419
sometimes smaller sometimes bigger this

271
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:33,129
we can notice if we have bigger files

272
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,230
and usually a little bit smaller for the

273
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,649
hours a little bit bigger and m4a is

274
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:43,480
slightly small difference and yeah the

275
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,160
arab speed factor is still number of

276
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,319
requests so in the group police game we

277
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,689
went down from 150 to request for this

278
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,089
sounds 213 which is quite awesome it's

279
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:56,049
like an eight percent of that yeah for

280
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:59,290
the other this is exactly size of the

281
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:08,829
files so let's do a short summary so

282
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:10,329
what we wanted to achieve in the grip

283
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:14,529
police game and what we wanted to

284
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:17,169
achieve anyway using other sprites is to

285
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:19,209
prepare solution for IE somehow to get

286
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,519
immediate access to all of them without

287
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,379
creating magnetic how many others price

288
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:25,839
we already have and for mobiles is also

289
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,579
really important where we have

290
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:31,119
limitations with the memory we also

291
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:34,480
achieve the smaller files they're less

292
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,639
dreary place to the service so somehow

293
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,160
we can also avoid situation that there

294
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,869
are some errors or river during the

295
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:44,369
creation the connection to server the

296
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:46,929
integral police case the group police

297
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,759
game we reach also lower memory usage

298
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,859
during the plank and creation of all

299
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:54,369
these parts and for the others who

300
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:55,720
wanted to

301
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,089
test it if it's really Worf to use it

302
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:00,759
it's supported by quite known libraries

303
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,339
likes a minute or two so just feel free

304
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:08,800
and put it there with the config what we

305
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,420
didn't want to achieve and what was

306
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,910
shown on this are our edge case it's

307
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,209
like 10 sounds at once case and where

308
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,550
this piece which is really high and the

309
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,029
memorial usage is really high there are

310
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:25,060
other bad parts I'll like a complicated

311
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,970
culture right if you wanted to do it by

312
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,000
this libraries and library by our own so

313
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,579
in this situation we have to catch all

314
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:35,620
these events and we have to take care

315
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,160
when to stop when to start which rely on

316
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,230
time average event which I already told

317
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,709
it's kind of buggy or not baggy but it's

318
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,100
not really reliable so on the mobiles we

319
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,540
can have some problems with some

320
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,459
glitches on playing two cents which we

321
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:53,649
shouldn't do that and of course the

322
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,430
loops because of the silence before

323
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,980
between these our merge files so without

324
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,050
fade in and fade out we can't do

325
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,630
anything all right thank you for your

326
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:16,690
attention yep that's

327
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:24,170
Thank You mehal do many questions I have

328
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,140
a question with especially with image

329
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,210
sprites a lot of the pain that's around

330
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,510
image sprites is ostensibly going to be

331
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,070
solved with something like HTTP to or

332
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,290
speedy how is that gonna affect audio

333
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,210
sprites does that make any sense so too

334
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,340
so like insert in terms of requests

335
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,630
right you don't actually have a request

336
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,890
for each thing right you could actually

337
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,570
batch push down a bunch of things you

338
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,730
don't need to sprite anymore does that

339
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,080
is that something that you guys just so

340
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,940
for other sprites we are reaching the

341
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,310
smaller files anyway small request and

342
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,440
we have an immediate access so if you're

343
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,360
trying for example start sitting up then

344
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,160
you owe the element on mobiles you take

345
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,630
some time and here you have already

346
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,160
created everything we just have to set

347
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,500
the current time and ply it so it's way

348
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,870
faster ok cool ok any questions any

349
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,470
other questions ok ok so if you have

350
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,750
more questions about the other surprise

351
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,820
or gaming so feel free to ask me

352
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,440
afterwards or my colleagues from

353
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,780
mini-games you dispatches extra bodies

354
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:27,510
so yeah cool thank you so

355
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:37,940
you
