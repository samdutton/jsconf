00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,699

hi thanks for coming I'm Rebecca Murphy

2
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,369
I am a JavaScript developer based out of

3
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,259
Durham North Carolina working as an

4
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:26,779
independent consultant buderim whoo

5
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:29,449
North Carolina not jet lagged anymore

6
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:31,189
thank God without a couple days and a

7
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:35,030
lot of drinking so yeah I want to talk

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,640
about modern JavaScript today and you

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,989
might have seen a blog post that I wrote

10
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,540
a couple weeks ago about this which is

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,879
kind of in reaction to someone who wrote

12
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:47,120
the blog about whether JavaScript was

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,309
kind of about to follow in the footsteps

14
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,329
of pearl and its its sordid history and

15
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,649
terrible misuse back in the day and and

16
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,079
in the slides in the blog post the

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,179
author whose name I'm conveniently

18
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:05,899
forgetting right now links to a slide

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,780
deck about modern pearl and this effort

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,530
in the pearl community to kind of try to

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,500
rehabilitate pearls image after terrible

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,530
terrible things were done with it in the

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,770
1990s and early 2000s and it kind of

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,210
resonated with me reading through it and

25
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,640
reading through the evolution of pearl

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,299
and how that community is trying to make

27
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,909
up for past mistakes and so I wrote a

28
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,590
blog post and wanted to talk about it a

29
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,250
little bit today at jas comp but first I

30
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,799
kind of want to take us back to 1900 ish

31
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,540
and talk about another community 110

32
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,200
years ago or so that decided to take

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,390
charge of his destiny because the powers

34
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,130
that be weren't making things happen

35
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,810
fast enough for them and they were they

36
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,140
were people who they were kind of the

37
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,789
hackers of the day they were the

38
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,439
developers of the day they this was

39
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,659
Brendan Eich and Douglas Crockford and

40
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,820
Alex Russell and some guy who's really

41
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,770
really tan

42
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,200
as these days were the hackers of the

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,620
day and they were automobile enthusiasts

44
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,750
these these new horseless carriages were

45
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,700
on the scene and they saw tremendous

46
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,269
potential in them both as a as a means

47
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:28,250
of entertainment and leisure and

48
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,099
adventure and also as a means of making

49
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,830
money these guys were working on some

50
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,780
really hard problems at the time they

51
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,030
were working on problems like how do we

52
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,190
get a light to shine off the front of a

53
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,040
car and they were working on problems

54
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,200
like actually how do we build electric

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,720
cars any day now those batteries will be

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,630
small enough that we can make them fit

57
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,370
and and so they were these were the

58
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,959
important problems of the day and they

59
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,799
were working really hard to solve them

60
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,970
in 1903 this guy named Horatio Nelson

61
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,400
Jackson was the first person to drive a

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,610
car across the country um this is about

63
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,620
what it looked like and it took him 63

64
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,650
days to get from probably New York to

65
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,139
San Francisco or there abouts this is a

66
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,430
big deal this was a thing like there

67
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,810
were guide books about how to do this

68
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,880
like this was a this is an adventure

69
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,010
this was and you had to be really rich I

70
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,120
don't know if you saw on that first

71
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,430
slide that one of these cars cost about

72
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,590
three thousand dollars which in today's

73
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,540
dollars about seventy two thousand

74
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,090
dollars so you had to be rich and you

75
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,980
had to be adventurous and you had to be

76
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,639
kind of prepared for everything in 1919

77
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,579
about 16 years later the US military

78
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:43,040
fresh off winning World War one helping

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,380
win world war one decided they were

80
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,840
going to try the same thing and this is

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,930
about how it went and not so well and it

82
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,139
took them they cut down the time to 61

83
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:57,010
days to get across the country and

84
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,329
terrible terrible things happen on this

85
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,829
part of the reason was they were using

86
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:03,590
fancy technology like solid wheels to

87
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,840
try to get there so in in a guidebook

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,720
from the time the the author said you

89
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,160
started out pretty much by the compass

90
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,840
finding or endeavoring to find the best

91
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,299
road if roads existed you could not tell

92
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,620
beforehand how long your trip would take

93
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,269
or whether in reality you would ever

94
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,840
reach your destination and when I

95
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,290
this I said hmm sounds a lot like our

96
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,760
lives right now in some ways we are

97
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,250
embarking on making JavaScript better

98
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,580
embarking on this adventure but when we

99
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,050
start out with a project we don't know

100
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,910
how long it's going to take to get where

101
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,470
we need to go we don't know whether

102
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,610
we're ever going to get there at all

103
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,380
necessarily and this is especially true

104
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,210
I think for you know we we are this is

105
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,190
rare air that we are breathing in here

106
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,889
we are the best and brightest who drove

107
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,620
you know flew our asses to Portland to

108
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,680
come be here for two days and and learn

109
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,669
what we can but I think this is

110
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:03,520
especially a problem for the everyday

111
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,970
users of the language that we're here to

112
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,580
celebrate and learn about so the bottom

113
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,639
line is that getting anywhere in the

114
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,320
early 1900's was completely a

115
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,720
do-it-yourself affair you really had to

116
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,639
be up for adventure there was very

117
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,060
little help from the powers that be

118
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,690
federal government the federal

119
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,610
government was didn't really buy into

120
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,950
this whole roads thing quite yet there

121
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,060
were a lot of people who were lobbying

122
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,970
for it but time after time you know

123
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,560
people would try to get the federal

124
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,810
government to pay for roads and to take

125
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,610
this seriously and they just weren't

126
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,180
interested individuals its individual

127
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,510
towns and counties and even states their

128
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,400
interest in solving these problems of

129
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,620
infrastructure was all over the map so

130
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,060
you had states like Pennsylvania that

131
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,289
we're doing a really good job of

132
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,220
embracing roads and paving them and that

133
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,510
this was important and you had states

134
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,270
like New Mexico where that convoy got

135
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,760
trapped in quicksand and almost didn't

136
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,030
make it so there were just huge

137
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,289
uncertainties when you embarked on

138
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,150
anything like this the guidebooks

139
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,150
offered advice about how to do it but

140
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,190
experience was really the only way that

141
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,080
you could hope to make it across the

142
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,380
country if you wanted to and even the US

143
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,960
military convoy in 1919 had to take a

144
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,470
civilian pilot with them who had driven

145
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,080
this road before because they didn't

146
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,340
trust that they could figure out how to

147
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,270
do it themselves so the problem the

148
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,099
bottom line problem was that people were

149
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:35,800
trying to do things with these new

150
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,539
it's called automobiles in the

151
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:39,849
infrastructure simply didn't exist to

152
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:43,030
actually pull it off and so in 1912 this

153
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,699
guy named Carl Fisher was out looking

154
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,080
for some cider probably got drunk

155
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,610
driving home in the dark in the rain he

156
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,750
gets lost and he climbs that he's he's

157
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,639
an enterprising new hacker and so he

158
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,590
climbs to the top of a pole lights match

159
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,300
hoping he's going to see a sign in the

160
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,610
dark to tell him which way it is back to

161
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,190
town instead he sees an ad for chewing

162
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,009
tobacco and he's really frustrated this

163
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,080
guy actually helped start the

164
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,909
Indianapolis Motor Speedway like he was

165
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:14,849
a big mover and shaker in the in the

166
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:18,340
automobile world of the early 1900s and

167
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,770
he saw that this lack of infrastructure

168
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,750
this lack of a system was limiting the

169
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,319
ability for automobiles to become the

170
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,909
thing that he want to see them become

171
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,069
and so from this moment his life's work

172
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:35,650
was born he decided that he was going to

173
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,830
build a highway across the country and

174
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,599
he said let's build it before we're too

175
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:43,300
old to enjoy it and to be clear when he

176
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,800
was talking about building a highway he

177
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,580
was talking about building something

178
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,849
that looked not unlike this we're not

179
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,680
talking like four-lane interstates or

180
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,330
eight Lane interstates with pavement all

181
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,400
that he just wanted a clear way to get

182
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,300
from one place to the other and this was

183
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,380
considered a fairly good road this is

184
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,960
actually a piece of the highway that was

185
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,469
eventually built I think this is in

186
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,550
ionno Nebraska or something like that

187
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,590
looks like Nebraska right so this was

188
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,900
considered a fairly good road and this

189
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,029
this was all that he was aiming to do

190
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,159
maybe pave some parts of it but like

191
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,430
just having a road exists and like I

192
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,719
said the people in in rural America

193
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,210
weren't really interested in putting

194
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,580
forth the effort to make this happen

195
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,759
they saw these 72,000 dollar

196
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,099
contraptions driving down there roads

197
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:34,810
scaring their horses and they didn't

198
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,800
understand why they should pay money to

199
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,810
try to improve the situation and so you

200
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,760
had these these enthusiasts these

201
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,680
evangelists and they were having a

202
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,920
really hard time connecting

203
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,779
with the people that they needed to

204
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,730
connect with in order to actually make

205
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,130
this happen so this is what they were

206
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,779
after this is about what they were

207
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:57,170
working with at the time and this was

208
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,329
you know this was a road nominally

209
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:01,850
speaking some places it was even worse

210
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,470
than this some places mountain passes

211
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,180
were not even wide enough for these

212
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,180
military trucks go down so this is what

213
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,920
they were working with and so Carl

214
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,110
Fisher got in touch with the people of

215
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,699
Goodyear and the people of packard in

216
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:16,010
the concrete companies and said let's

217
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:16,970
raise some money the federal

218
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,529
government's not going to do this for us

219
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,709
let's raise some money I think it'll

220
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,350
take 10 million dollars to build a road

221
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,410
across the country he's wrong cost a lot

222
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,180
more than that to build 3,300 miles road

223
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:35,329
even in 1912 1913 but he organized the

224
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:37,699
Lincoln Highway Association and so then

225
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:40,279
know that L was not for loozer that L

226
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,790
was the Lincoln Highway he organized the

227
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,910
Lincoln Highway Association and like I

228
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,199
said the ten-million-dollar goal that

229
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:50,690
they had was not it wasn't realistic and

230
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,980
they had a hard time raising it anyway

231
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,560
and so they decided that they were going

232
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,600
to kind of scale back their goals and

233
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,670
make their goals things that they could

234
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,140
achieve make their goals things that

235
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,120
were attainable and that would help them

236
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,290
move toward this reality of

237
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,390
infrastructure that they want to see

238
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,209
they decided they would choose a path

239
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,250
they would put up signs and they would

240
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,550
plant seedling miles out in the country

241
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,930
and the sea-thing miles are interesting

242
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,949
because what they did is so I told you

243
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:23,480
they had the concrete companies that

244
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,220
they had partnered up with the concrete

245
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,899
companies knowing that they would make a

246
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,180
whole lot of money as soon as people

247
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,980
started building roads the conquering

248
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,290
companies agreed to donate a mile of

249
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,750
concrete and in exchange towns that

250
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,750
accepted that mile of concrete would

251
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,370
donate the labor or raise money for the

252
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,430
labor to build one mile of road they

253
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,810
would build this one mile of road out in

254
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,970
the middle of nowhere and people would

255
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,949
drive over those terrible rutted roads

256
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,110
to come to this one mile of pristine

257
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,000
highway in the middle of nowhere and

258
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,540
suddenly all the townspeople who did

259
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,700
want their horses frightened started to

260
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,290
realize this might not be such a bad

261
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,520
idea after all this whole highway thing

262
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,570
this is where we come back to modern

263
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,630
JavaScript and what I want to talk about

264
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,130
today we need to choose path we need to

265
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,250
put up signs and we need to plant these

266
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,670
seedlings miles and this is I'm going to

267
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,900
talk a little bit about what I think

268
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,980
that means to JavaScript but yeah there

269
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,260
we go so the path was very was a key

270
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,720
part of this they what was going on is

271
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,430
you had all of these dis transistors

272
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,940
with no central authority trying to you

273
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,920
just doing things in isolation roads

274
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,050
went from one town to another one County

275
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,850
to another rose didn't go across states

276
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,250
and roads certainly didn't connect one

277
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,900
state to another and so this was part of

278
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,150
the vision that these guys had was that

279
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,110
if we can say this is how you get from

280
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,570
New York to San Francisco then all of

281
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,940
the services that need to emerge all of

282
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,740
the infrastructure that needs to emerge

283
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,290
around this path will happen if we can

284
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,670
just say this is the path so without

285
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,610
that path it was only by investing

286
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,260
tremendous effort that people could get

287
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,000
from one place to another and without

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,540
this path without knowing how you get

289
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,980
from New York to San Francisco without

290
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,800
knowing how you structure a JavaScript

291
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,330
application without knowing how you do

292
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,000
more than manipulate the Dom people

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,210
don't know what the heck to do so a few

294
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,590
things that I think that we need to do

295
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,850
as a community to say this is the path

296
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,970
number one the core that all the

297
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,030
libraries provide Dom manipulation Ajax

298
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,540
event event binding array utilities

299
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,310
those sorts of things that needs to

300
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,980
become a commodity that process I think

301
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,400
is going to be extremely painful alex

302
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,660
russell who may or may not be in here

303
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,870
will tell me that it can't be done he

304
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,000
might be right but i think that the core

305
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,930
needs to become a commodity we need to

306
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,360
agree that you know years later we have

307
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,030
figured out how we select Dom elements

308
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,320
we have figured out how

309
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,090
we iterate over arrays now of course

310
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,990
like the j s next has figured these

311
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,850
things out but the fact is normal people

312
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,070
are still developing with the old eyes

313
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,140
and they will be for a long time as a

314
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,900
community we can't I think that if we

315
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,300
wait for the browsers to give us the

316
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,580
tools that we need we are just going to

317
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,680
be in on hold until sometime a year two

318
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,060
years three years from now I don't know

319
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,370
where as as a community and especially

320
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,870
as the larger community of everyday

321
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,820
users we are going to be on hold so

322
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,950
number one the core needs to become a

323
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,230
commodity that means that we need to

324
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,890
figure out what are the api's for doing

325
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,540
these simple things that we always need

326
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,100
to do and there can be different

327
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,840
implementations of those api's and

328
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,030
that's fine but we need to agree this

329
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,640
these are the api's and you can pick and

330
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,260
choose you can get your Dom stuff from

331
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,180
jQuery you can get your ex HR from dojo

332
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,410
and you can get your rate manipulation

333
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,970
from Yui if you want to and andrew de

334
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,470
pont did a great job I hate told me not

335
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,090
to say any more nice things about him

336
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,250
but I'm still going to do it it's give

337
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,830
me a dirty look energy Pont did a great

338
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,510
job talking about a specific example of

339
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,240
this in function prototype bind we know

340
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,740
that that is going to be how it is and

341
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,070
it's time for for libraries to think

342
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,780
about adopting that even if it means

343
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,430
breaking backwards compatibility because

344
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,440
that is where we are headed and that

345
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,000
that sort of functionality needs to

346
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,350
become a commodity not a branded feature

347
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,640
number two we need a standardized module

348
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,190
system so that when one person provide

349
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,560
one library provides a Dom utility in

350
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,450
one library provides an xhr utility in

351
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,600
one library provides event utility we

352
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,400
can cherry-pick the pieces that we want

353
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,070
we can start to build Best of Breed

354
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,740
solutions instead of being locked into a

355
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,620
single vendor for our entire JavaScript

356
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,650
application and again we can't wait for

357
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,450
browsers to do this for us i'm really

358
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,040
excited about what Mozilla was talking

359
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,100
at the Mozilla dan dan Herman Dave

360
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,290
Herman when

361
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,480
I'm excited about what he was talking

362
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,089
about today that is not going to happen

363
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,649
soon enough we need to start demanding

364
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,570
this now and we need to start figuring

365
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,820
this out now until this exists we are

366
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,560
going to be locked into these silos of

367
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,350
libraries these silos of tools or we're

368
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,209
going to be stuck figuring it out figure

369
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,699
it out ourselves if we build roller own

370
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:31,370
solutions I'm really excited about AMD

371
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,230
I'm really excited that dojo has

372
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,569
embraced AMD I hope other libraries are

373
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,769
going to start to do the same I had a

374
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,120
great talk with Luke Smith yesterday

375
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,720
about why you eyes module system and how

376
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,370
there may be a path for them to also

377
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,829
embrace AMD I want to see everybody just

378
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:47,240
say this is how we're going to do it is

379
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,190
it perfect I don't know but until we

380
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,220
figure this out we are stuck in these

381
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,870
silos or we are stuck in these rural

382
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,420
your own situations number three and

383
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,810
kind of a part of the module problem is

384
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,970
library agnostic dependency management

385
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,519
this needs to be a huge priority for us

386
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,350
so that we can start mixing and matching

387
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,529
we again need to agree this is how we

388
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:11,089
will start requiring things and it's

389
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:14,269
kind of an embarrassment to the language

390
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,120
no offense to Brendan that 15 years

391
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,600
later we are still many people are still

392
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,279
managing their JavaScript dependencies

393
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,720
through script tags that that is not a

394
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,839
that is not a 15 year old answer to the

395
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,910
dependency management problem and yet it

396
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,800
is in many ways the best answer that a

397
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,389
lot of people have come up with so we

398
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:40,269
need to start saying stuff like this

399
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:43,220
right now if you use underscore and you

400
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,810
use jQuery then you have huge

401
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,160
duplication as far as there are rare

402
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,680
utilities in them and that's that sort

403
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,439
of problem happens with lots of

404
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:56,990
combinations where these micro libraries

405
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,510
are great but if there's duplication of

406
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,760
core functionality and then those are

407
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,019
bytes that were sending over the wire

408
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:05,329
that we don't need to send so we need to

409
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:08,179
start prioritizing breaking things into

410
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:11,540
the smallest rational piece the sign for

411
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,540
this part is pretty easy I think the

412
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,069
signposts they took the guesswork out of

413
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,500
navigating across the country they made

414
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,390
it so that you knew where to go you knew

415
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,760
which way to turn

416
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,680
uh when you got to an intersection you

417
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,540
knew were where you were going which was

418
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,670
not a thing that you knew before the

419
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,320
Lincoln Highway came along it was kind

420
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,480
of you asked the farmer maybe he tore

421
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,640
down the farmers fence to get across his

422
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,150
land I said this in my modern JavaScript

423
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,770
post I just want to say it again that

424
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,600
you know god bless everyone he's working

425
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,630
on making the next script loader because

426
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,460
we don't have enough in the next

427
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,630
templating engine because we don't have

428
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,970
enough and the next array utilities to

429
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,010
look so you don't have enough but all

430
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,570
these things in the world like I'm so

431
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,950
glad I'm not really glad that you're

432
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,700
writing them I'll be honest um I want to

433
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,390
see people smart people the people who

434
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,540
are smart enough to write these tools

435
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,980
explaining to other people how and why

436
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,650
to use these tools and working to

437
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,320
improve the existing tools I think that

438
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,690
it is a position of hutzpah how do I say

439
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:22,060
that he say it at him Oh hutzpah to say

440
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,720
that I can do this better than than

441
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,640
someone else who has done it before and

442
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,200
who is thought about before and who has

443
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,270
closed 50 bugs on their own project

444
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,100
about this thing that you're just

445
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,370
sorting to think about I want to see

446
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,710
more education education is that is the

447
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,090
signposts of our of this problem is

448
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,590
letting people who don't get to come to

449
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,050
these conferences understand why these

450
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,610
things are important and how to use them

451
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,750
I think it's something that we're

452
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,640
struggling with it's hard to create

453
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,280
sufficiently complex examples that are

454
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,810
sufficiently simple to understand I

455
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,370
think as a community we need to work on

456
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,400
that and start putting up these signpost

457
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,790
so that people can can know which way to

458
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,710
turn seething miles so we talked about

459
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,120
what what those were as far as the

460
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,670
Lincoln Highway again I think that it's

461
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,730
education in demos I also think its

462
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,860
users asking demanding from libraries

463
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,690
this intentional operability this

464
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,360
intentional interoperability that looks

465
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,010
so good on screen it's really hard to

466
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,140
say pressuring libraries to the

467
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,390
libraries are the people who say that

468
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,970
you know those fancy cars are going to

469
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,230
scare the horses

470
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,540
we need to be as a community saying I

471
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,940
demand this indent this interoperability

472
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,920
we've seen some good examples of it

473
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,140
already I think that libraries are

474
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,540
naturally hesitant about this because

475
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,730
there will be winners and losers some

476
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,290
person some libraries the DA

477
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,940
manipulation tools may win in some

478
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,520
libraries event system a win it may it

479
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,410
is going to lead to fragmentation but

480
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,510
it's also going to lead to us coalescing

481
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,930
around a best-of-breed solution right

482
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,160
now there are a lot of social rewards

483
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,560
for releasing new things there you know

484
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,480
you release a new script loader you're

485
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,710
on Hacker News you release new

486
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,970
templating engine you're on hacker news

487
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,370
there's a lot of rewards right now and I

488
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,390
think the rewards are a little bit

489
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,660
misaligned we need to somehow I don't

490
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,280
know how we need to find ways to reward

491
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,660
the people who are doing the grunt work

492
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,630
of closing the tickets and fixing the

493
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,790
bugs and improving existing solutions

494
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,980
and I do think that a lot of this is

495
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,890
going to be up to users to not flock to

496
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,660
the shiny new thing but to to respect

497
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,100
the work that has been done and I'm not

498
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,270
saying there's not a need for new

499
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,500
solutions there's not a need for new

500
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,930
tools there's always that god bless the

501
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,190
people who are doing if we were doing

502
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,920
good thinking in those areas but I think

503
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,870
that we've shifted Verret we're very

504
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,970
much on that side of the pendulum swing

505
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,560
and it's important that we come back a

506
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,210
little bit and start educating people

507
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,670
how to use these tools and improving the

508
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,800
existing tools we have seen some good

509
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,140
examples of this promises landing and

510
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,850
jQuery was pretty exciting for me

511
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,400
because in theory like it was sort of

512
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,830
the first demonstration of the theory

513
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,290
that you could make an xhr request with

514
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,660
jquery and hand it off to something that

515
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,940
understands the promises a b.j I don't

516
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,770
remember it handed off to something that

517
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,530
understands the the promises API that

518
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,390
doesn't have to be jquery that was a

519
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,130
huge and exciting thing I want to see

520
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,010
more of that I dojo just spent a huge

521
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,590
portion of their 1.6 release changing

522
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,710
their digit and dojo modules over to AMD

523
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,400
modules from their own custom a

524
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,230
dependency management system that's also

525
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,760
really exciting uber j/s is another

526
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,250
project that is kind of working on

527
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,120
coming up with a common solutions you

528
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,020
know canonic

529
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,090
solutions to these problems that they're

530
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,370
solved their solved problems we don't

531
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,100
need to solve them over and over again

532
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,840
um I already kind of touched on this

533
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,120
don't be Denver um and I think that we

534
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,640
need to it needs to be okay for people

535
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,100
to say don't be done versa Denver and

536
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,720
towns all across the country when this

537
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,250
when they were planning the route for

538
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,580
this highway across the country they

539
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,170
wanted to be on it you know now you get

540
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,340
pissed when I highway comes through your

541
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,350
town but in the back then that was the

542
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,430
most exciting thing that was happening

543
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,080
once people kind of got on board with it

544
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,940
was was they wanted to be on this

545
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,560
highway because it was especially in the

546
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,530
rural West this was going to be there

547
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,810
their salvation to be on this Highway

548
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,820
turns out all they have is like a bunch

549
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:38,870
of mcdonalds now but so Denver um once

550
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,960
this route was announced Denver said

551
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,890
officially we're not on the route but

552
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,120
we're going to put up signs saying that

553
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,580
we are and the Lincoln Highway

554
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,410
Association had to have a special line

555
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,120
than their guidebook that said when you

556
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,830
get to Denver or when you get in your

557
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,280
denver keep going straight they're lying

558
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,540
and again this is a tough thing i don't

559
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,010
want to say all fragmentation is

560
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,360
terrible but i do think that as a

561
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,370
community we need to we need to think

562
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,340
about how do we get on how do we get on

563
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,350
a common path what is that is there some

564
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,840
common path that we can arrive at and i

565
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,000
think it needs to be okay when skeptics

566
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
say you this is not helping us move

567
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,890
forward this is diverting us from the

568
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,880
true task here I think that as a

569
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,260
community there can be a lot of heated

570
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,300
discussions when skeptics say I'm not so

571
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,190
sure this is the hot new thing I think

572
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,480
we need to embrace those skeptics a

573
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,250
little bit more and welcome those

574
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,960
conversations the skeptics may be wrong

575
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,490
the skeptics may be right but we need to

576
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,570
welcome those conversations and

577
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,000
appreciate them as part of the larger

578
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,050
conversation where you're having about

579
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,480
how to get where we're trying to go so

580
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,190
it's up to users to ask is it designed

581
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,140
well to play with others what does this

582
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,860
solve it that hasn't already been solved

583
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,260
why is it better to use this than for to

584
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,520
work with something that already exists

585
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,830
and it has a legacy of community and

586
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,080
bugs and all that and does the author

587
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,820
know what they don't know you know just

588
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,879
the author even

589
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:02,039
lies what problems they haven't even

590
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,690
thought of because they just released

591
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,919
this last week versus the lifetime a

592
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,089
tool that has been around for years and

593
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:13,709
years so modern JavaScript we need to

594
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:15,479
figure out the path is we need to put up

595
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:17,279
signposts need to plant these seedlings

596
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,819
miles and let's build it the forward
