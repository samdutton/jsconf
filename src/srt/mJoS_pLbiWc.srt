00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:35,439

I

2
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:38,269
things that I like about my profession

3
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:41,100
about development specifically is that

4
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,659
it's kind of constantly evolving and

5
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:44,970
it's moving route fairly fast I think

6
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,829
compared to other things I love my job

7
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,440
because I can do everything I have in my

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,170
hat and create stuff that other people

9
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,729
can see because you only need the

10
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,219
problem I like JavaScript so anything

11
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,690
that has to do with JavaScript

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,180
immediately excites me there's no right

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,429
way to do things I think a note in

14
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,110
particular people keep inventing new

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,030
ways of doing stuff and everybody goes

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,590
oh we could be doing it that way or we

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,759
could be doing it this way and nobody's

18
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:10,649
really sure like what's the best way and

19
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:12,149
that's my favorite thing about it is

20
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:14,250
it's still constantly changing I really

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,770
love developing software and helping

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,740
others I'm also instructor and I love

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,600
combining the two where I've depends on

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,700
experience and it can go to people and

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,399
explain stuff that really works at the

26
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:28,140
community I mean as I talked about in my

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,929
talk was I love the community is why I

28
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:32,940
stick with the web and wife stuff with

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,619
continuing to push it forward because I

30
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,509
think it's really inclusive and really

31
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,890
easy and approachable to get started

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,479
with and in case you to bring in more

33
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,160
people from different disciplines I love

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,950
the ability to write something on my

35
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,080
laptop and publish it to the world and

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,700
have an impact on people and help their

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,530
feedback as a researcher I get a lot of

38
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,509
flexibility I get to play with new

39
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,650
things and

40
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,350
more ideas I love being able to work on

41
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,420
something with other people that in the

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,820
end has impact and being able to help

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,530
people with what we do with technology

44
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,840
is really thing that I enjoy most about

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:31,150
