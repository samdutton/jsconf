00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,850

my name is Aaron queen I created this

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,590
thing called Sami Jas which Chris

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,359
probably mentioned but it's a little

4
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,970
framework based on top of jQuery you can

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,119
go check it out it's pretty awesome but

6
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,999
not that awesome and that's why Chris

7
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:27,009
wouldn't let me talk about it here but

8
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:28,539
instead what I'm going to talk about

9
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:29,319
today

10
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:30,759
something is you're in my heart and I

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,550
think everyone here has extra extra

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,530
JavaScript passions things that outside

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,789
of JavaScript that they're passionate

14
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:40,269
about an extra code passion so one of my

15
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:43,120
passions kind of nodes really well with

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,769
the Jay s complement ality and that

17
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:48,579
passion is bacon so not just bacon in

18
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,039
the sense of oh man I love eating bacon

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,170
it's awesome no bacon in the sense that

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,440
I make my own bacon so okay I already

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,179
went over this I also want to mention

22
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,039
the on github boom quirky so if you

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,219
actually want to see code I've written

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,030
these we're not going to talk that much

25
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,100
about code today go to github slash

26
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,140
quirky I'm also the founder of this

27
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,820
little thing I started in New York

28
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,070
called code food bar and the idea behind

29
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,070
code food bar was that in New York at

30
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,170
least we have a lot of meetups and our

31
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,850
meetups are centered around hey

32
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,650
everybody let's have a presentation and

33
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,270
hey then let's go to the bar that's

34
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,860
really noisy and fills with other people

35
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,630
who aren't developers and we can't

36
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,340
actually talk but well like drink and be

37
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,320
like oh yeah yeah yeah but what I wanted

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,210
was to find a way that developers can

39
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,490
sit down in an intimate setting over

40
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,200
good food and have actual discussion so

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,580
I started this thing a couple months ago

42
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,920
in New York and we hadn't in Edinburgh

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,750
when I was there and I kind of want

44
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,250
other people in other cities to start

45
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,140
them too and then I want to travel to

46
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,910
those other cities and have good food so

47
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,040
please if you're interested in talk to

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,650
me later so quick little prologue I

49
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,640
don't know

50
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,350
I'm gonna run out of time now but I'm

51
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,270
gonna go quick so prologue my brother is

52
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,960
a day trader and he's not really

53
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,910
developer and we have disagreements

54
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,290
about certain things we're very

55
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,040
different was he like

56
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,240
you know likes money

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,890
I do like money but that's not my main

58
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,410
thing and we're feel like Manhattan I'm

59
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,760
still a Brooklynite at heart so keep

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,890
having this intense argument basically

61
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,660
like every time we're at my parents

62
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,640
house together my parents are not

63
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,910
exactly great cooks what happens is we

64
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,660
start talking about Tomatoes he is

65
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,130
especially in the summertime you'll get

66
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,940
these really amazing amazing fresh

67
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,320
heirloom tomatoes and I think that those

68
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,990
are the epitome of tomato that is what

69
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,850
tomato is and I tell them that I'm like

70
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,590
in the winter I'm not gonna eat a tomato

71
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm not gonna eat this crappy mealy ass

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,180
plum tomato that my parents have at

73
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,890
their house and he starts screaming at

74
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,270
me he's like what do you mean you're not

75
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,459
gonna eat a tomato it's just a tomato so

76
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,620
the title of this talk is making bacon

77
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,310
making code so we're gonna start start

78
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,470
off from the beginning a brief history

79
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,440
of bacon up until the 19th century or

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,010
the 20th century so bacon began as a

81
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,040
necessity like truly a necessity

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
basically if you didn't have a way to

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,780
preserve meat through the winter you

84
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,570
would die so people figured out that hey

85
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,239
if we salt stuff and smoke stuff this

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,310
meat that basically pigs will only

87
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,350
produce certain times a year or other

88
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,440
animals - hey we can cure this meat and

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,019
fix it so then we can use it all year

90
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,769
round so here's some awesome historical

91
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,200
photos here's a guy very unsuspecting

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,110
pig waiting there and there's winter

93
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,900
medieval winter which I would not have

94
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,230
wanted to been alive during and bacon

95
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,940
started earlier in like other cultures

96
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,200
but we're talking about bacon here not

97
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,330
just cured products but people were in

98
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,650
the north of Europe basically when salt

99
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,750
came around they figured oh hey we can

100
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,450
take this thing called salt and we can

101
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,150
mine it and then we can use that salt to

102
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,959
make products that we have and produce

103
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,360
that we do and create during the summer

104
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,550
months in the spring and use it

105
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,229
year-round or use it for many more

106
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:27,250
months

107
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,980
- like I said true me means that Johnny

108
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,200
doesn't have to die basically they were

109
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,600
like oh hey Johnny you're not going to

110
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,910
survive the winter because we ate our

111
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,320
Pig and sorry okay you live to 28 years

112
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,780
old you're not really looking you know

113
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,790
it's like this guy he's like 32 it's

114
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,630
like oh man that guy is old but

115
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,550
specifically I mean we talked about

116
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,820
curing lots of stuff we cure produce

117
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,130
like pickles we cure things vegetables

118
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm sure everyone here might be fans of

119
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,850
pickles I love pickles personally but

120
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,100
there's some kind of pinnacle of curing

121
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,070
and that pinnacle has to do with the pig

122
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,460
itself basically the pig is a Noble

123
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,880
Beast it's not a predator it basically

124
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,160
for it it's basically a forager in the

125
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,320
wild and in the inn when you raise pigs

126
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,410
basically you can feed them very cheap

127
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,600
things and very easy things and they'll

128
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,400
they'll keep surviving and actually a

129
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,570
lot of people recently have started

130
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,070
taking pigs as pets I don't know if

131
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,510
you've noticed this but they're they're

132
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,919
quiet soft lovable animals but yeah

133
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,100
that's a beautiful pig so this is a red

134
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,870
swaddle which is an heirloom Pig and

135
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,740
they're soon they're they're slowly

136
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,060
bringing these back and we'll get back

137
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,800
into that later but can anyone tell me

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,090
where bacon comes from on this pig

139
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,690
anyone that like someone said belly so

140
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,060
yeah belly belly is the right answer

141
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,590
that's bacon right there and bacon is a

142
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,000
very specific thing when we talk about

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,500
like prosciutto or things like that

144
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,450
those aren't bacon those are other cured

145
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,750
pork products prosciutto actually this

146
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,080
is prosciutto right here this is what a

147
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,810
lien guanciale the other Italian cure

148
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,760
meat pancetta also comes from the same

149
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,640
thing as bacon but instead of smoked

150
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,740
curing it or salt curing it they roll it

151
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,840
up put in a none tight package and hang

152
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,790
it for a month I've made that before too

153
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,280
it's quite delicious

154
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,950
but why bacon you know we have all these

155
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,750
other pork products so we figured out

156
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,670
the pig is the ideal animal because

157
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,430
awesome why bacon why do we why why is

158
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,870
bacon so important so we think about

159
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,090
ultimate combinations and you know

160
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,770
everyone's like okay peanut butter and

161
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,380
jelly peanut butter and jelly is the

162
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,050
ultimate combo sorry sorry peanut butter

163
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,480
and jelly is not the ultimate combo

164
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,490
flavorful meat and plentiful fat is the

165
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,240
ultimate combination and we find this

166
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,250
all over and not just in bacon but

167
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,290
obviously in in beef too if you've ever

168
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,670
had beef short rib slow-cooked beef

169
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,620
short ribs that's also a flavorful meat

170
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,630
plentiful fat but bacon is the ultimate

171
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,780
combination of the ultimate combination

172
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,960
it's the ultimate ultimate and what I

173
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,680
mean by that is not only is it not only

174
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,310
is it flavorful fat and plentiful

175
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,990
plentiful fat and flavorful meat but

176
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,300
it's also salt which is anything

177
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,920
combined with salt is an ultimate

178
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,450
combination and also smoke which is like

179
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:47,000
squared so chapter 2 making bacon so now

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,410
here we get into the nitty gritty if any

181
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,880
or if any of you are vegans in the

182
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,590
audience all right I'm sorry you saw you

183
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,350
saw the bacon this morning you you've

184
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,350
been around bacon enough to know that

185
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,640
that it's going to be there you can't

186
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,460
really avoid it I'm down I'm down with

187
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,280
the vegan cause I just like me

188
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:13,040
so basically the bacon this is a just a

189
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,510
fact I'm not even gonna you can't

190
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,300
question this the best bacon you've ever

191
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,100
had is the bacon that you've made

192
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,650
yourself Bar None I'm sorry you're not

193
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,020
even if it's even if it's not as good as

194
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,700
someone else's bacon like when you've

195
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,530
had in something they mean it trust me

196
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,680
it's the best bacon you've ever had so

197
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,240
right now I'm going to try to see if I

198
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,920
can navigate here and show you guys a

199
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,330
little video I don't know if the sounds

200
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:56,510
working

201
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,410
welcome to making bacon is there and

202
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,300
quit so we'll go into more detail after

203
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,250
this it's kind of like the video when

204
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,350
you're in Disneyland or something they

205
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,430
show you the initial video then you go

206
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:47,660
on the ride

207
00:09:47,670 --> 00:10:47,140
a very chubby hand

208
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,930
mmm that's the taste of victory my

209
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,940
friends you guys are all hung Jesus

210
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,790
Christ torture

211
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:11,230
all right so really quickly we're gonna

212
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,670
go through kind of what you just saw in

213
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,520
the video basic step step one procure

214
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,830
ingredients so the only ingredients

215
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,200
really need are what's listed there and

216
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,420
it's really simple way simpler than you

217
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,280
could possibly imagine

218
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,470
you get a pork belly hopefully you have

219
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,210
a local butcher that can supply this to

220
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,150
you I have my butcher Louis Paesanos

221
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,150
also known as the friend and they are my

222
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,260
friends and they supply me with

223
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,810
excellent pork belly next thing you need

224
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,460
kosher salt which is not the salt that

225
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,720
you get in a little Morton's thing it's

226
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
like a big thing of kosher salt but it's

227
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,530
a they sell out the grocery store a

228
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,250
bunch of spices and pink salt which is

229
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,230
the only ingredient that you won't be

230
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,120
able to find in a regular grocery store

231
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,650
but you can get it mail-order and it's

232
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,960
like for a bag like this big like $3

233
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,900
seriously and you need a tablespoon per

234
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,290
entire five pounds of bacon and then you

235
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,360
did a big big asset block bag like two

236
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,040
gallons so step two curing so just to

237
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,120
tell you a little more details about

238
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,620
what curing is so you guys can leave

239
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,990
here knowing really what bacon is all

240
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,330
about curing and smoking are really

241
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,590
doing the same thing what they're doing

242
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,420
and I'll try to explain this in ways

243
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,890
that you can understand so when you cure

244
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,800
bacon all it's doing is over time and

245
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,600
over the course of a week here as you

246
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,610
can see is or that's by day daily daily

247
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,430
it's the moisture is going down so what

248
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,980
salt does this miracle thing is it takes

249
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,230
moisture out of whatever you put it on

250
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,670
basically you know when you like salt

251
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,350
tomatoes when you're making a salsa and

252
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,180
then ten minutes later you come back and

253
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,560
there's like a pile of tomato juice and

254
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,120
these like really mealy little tomato

255
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,610
bits that's salt that's salt at work all

256
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,760
it's doing is drawing moisture out so

257
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,830
why that works for curing is because

258
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,320
certain bacteria just or most bacteria

259
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,030
can't live without moisture they feed

260
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,710
off of it that's how they survive so

261
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,970
when you take the moisture away you kill

262
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,560
the bacteria or kill the potential

263
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,570
bacteria and then what pink salt does is

264
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,210
it doesn't even better plus it adds this

265
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,370
extra flavor plus

266
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,680
the chemical is in sodium nitrate which

267
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,240
are pink salt also promote the specific

268
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,610
bacteria that's good and prevents bad

269
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,800
bacteria so step three and this is the

270
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,399
hardest part

271
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,379
you wait for a week right and that's a

272
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,029
really really hard because you

273
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,230
see it in the fridge and you keep

274
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,999
turning it over and they're like oh my

275
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,680
god this is gonna be so good but you

276
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,209
can't touch it obviously it's raw you're

277
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:36,970
not gonna eat it raw and the step four

278
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,579
is smoking or baking so if you want to

279
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:41,079
smoke at home you don't need a smoker if

280
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,519
you have a kettle grill you take a

281
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,839
kettle grill you put some charcoal on

282
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,670
one side put a drip pan underneath it

283
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,740
put it down let it get to medium heat

284
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,050
put the cover on an hour and a half

285
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,670
later you check it check the temperature

286
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,069
when it gets up to 150 perfect you take

287
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:55,720
it off and it absorbed all that amazing

288
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,029
smoke from the charcoal grill but what I

289
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,290
do at home too and I don't have a

290
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,509
charcoal grill handy is you just put in

291
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:02,459
an oven at the lowest temperature

292
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,420
basically you're bringing it up to

293
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,370
temperature that's all you're doing and

294
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,860
then Step five isn't you enjoy the

295
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,230
out of your hard work so the things you

296
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,300
can do with your bacon you you can

297
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,829
imagine come on like what do you do with

298
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:17,410
bacon you make BLTs you Clarence without

299
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,259
here's one that I get from my own life

300
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,750
and I suggest you do yourself if you

301
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,490
have bacon you're like hey buddy I know

302
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,139
you have all those home brews that

303
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,160
you're making because I know a lot of

304
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,809
people do home brewing it's like here I

305
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,689
will trade you this chunk of bacon for a

306
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:33,100
six-pack of your homebrew another guy's

307
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,230
like oh dude it's like old school

308
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,529
bartering it's pretty cool and basically

309
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,029
you add it to anything and it's awesome

310
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,309
eat it love it so alright we're gonna

311
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:44,500
step back a brief history of bacon part

312
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,629
two so this is where we get into

313
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,430
something that's very true to my heart

314
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,730
and probably true to probably true to

315
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,920
every vegans heart too but basically

316
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,620
winter ain't gonna kill Johnny anymore

317
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,449
we're in the modern times we have

318
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,910
refrigeration you know we don't really

319
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,559
need to cure anything so curing things

320
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,959
becomes a way to add flavor and imbue

321
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,480
something that we think will make our

322
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,519
food better it has nothing to do with

323
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,439
actual survival so when you get from

324
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:16,749
making bacon as a way of surviving - oh

325
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,029
it's just gonna add flavor hey let's see

326
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:21,370
if we can shortcut that entire system so

327
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,649
how do you systematically make big in

328
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:25,329
production cheaper it's really easy

329
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:25,900
actually

330
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,990
first you feed the pig surplus corn in

331
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,150
America okay we have this ton of corn

332
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,550
pigs don't normally eat corn but it

333
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,580
let's feed it to them and everybody's

334
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,110
like oh this is awesome we have all this

335
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,210
extra corn and we don't know what to do

336
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,580
with it it's not human grade humans

337
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,440
can't eat it let's just feed it to our

338
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,510
animals and holy crap they're getting so

339
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,190
fat this rules

340
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,840
and we'll see why that's not the case in

341
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,540
a second but anyway then you also breed

342
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,040
the pigs for size and production so they

343
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,050
also realized oh hey we can crossbreed

344
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,940
get rid of these heirloom breeds that

345
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,190
sometimes produce like really a lot of

346
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,510
fat and sometimes are really a lot of

347
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,190
food and sometimes they don't let's just

348
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,990
breed this perfect pig that will produce

349
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,940
the perfect amount of fat and the

350
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,620
perfect amount of meat and we'll just

351
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,260
it'll be really cheap for us to produce

352
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,760
third yeah mass-produce the flesh and

353
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,400
the fat and okay so this is the part

354
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,630
that's gonna freak the out of you

355
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,270
guys I didn't know this until like three

356
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,160
weeks ago or a couple months ago

357
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,490
basically the bacon that you eat that

358
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,290
the Hillshire farms bacon that you get

359
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,250
at the grocery store

360
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,130
it hasn't been cured it's been cured for

361
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,940
maybe 40 minutes an hour two hours what

362
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,320
they do is they take the pork belly

363
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,450
which come off this factory line you

364
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,160
know don't even imagine the kill floor

365
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,870
it's not even it's not good right now

366
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,210
but you get you get the bacon you get

367
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,070
the pork bellies cut them into perfect

368
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,930
squares right with a machine that's just

369
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,820
like a cookie cutter and then you take

370
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,400
this giant imagine this giant hypodermic

371
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,680
needle filled with salt and water and

372
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,780
other spices and let's just inject that

373
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,720
into the pork belly and all it does is

374
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,460
it it's like oh here we had this thin

375
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,500
pork belly because we had this pig that

376
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,790
we were feeding on corn so it's not

377
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,470
producing that much unnecessarily a good

378
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,970
amount of meat hey if we inject water

379
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,709
into it oh look it's like that big it's

380
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,380
awesome and we don't really need to cure

381
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,459
it for you know for next Adam necessity

382
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,680
so we're just injecting salt water into

383
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,839
it brine and preservatives to make it

384
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,930
last longer so that's where it comes

385
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,910
down to this cook bacon should not look

386
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,740
like that that's the bacon that everyone

387
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,209
here is probably familiar with today's

388
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:29,440
bacon was actually really good I was

389
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,070
really impressed

390
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,950
but cooked bacon right you put it in the

391
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,930
pan or the ho sheriff arm is baking you

392
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,580
put in the pan ten minutes later it's

393
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,710
like this thin and really crispy that's

394
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,830
all that water

395
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,049
they inject it into it just seeping out

396
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,760
when you get a real pork belly and you

397
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,899
chop it yourself and you everything

398
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:45,289
yourself

399
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:47,330
it's a thick beautiful slice and you

400
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,710
bite into it it's like a piece of meat

401
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,769
it's like a deli slice not this watery

402
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:54,649
ass right it should look like that

403
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,090
that's the bacon that I made that day

404
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,399
Brian Mitchell who's taking pictures had

405
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,630
a bite of this you can go to him later

406
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,230
and be like was that bacon good all

407
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,840
right so where do we go from there where

408
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,140
do we go from this point where were mass

409
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,539
producing bacon so at some point someone

410
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:12,769
realized that the mass-produced crap

411
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:15,470
doesn't taste good and what they did was

412
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,299
they kind of started this movement this

413
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:20,960
underground movement to to really get

414
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,610
bacon to back where it should be and not

415
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,860
just bacon but all food there's another

416
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,779
slide just so you guys I'm just keeping

417
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:31,010
you on track so names you should know in

418
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,630
the slow food movement I don't know some

419
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,710
of you might know they some of you might

420
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,320
not but write them down or check out

421
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,330
slides out later and do some look them

422
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,880
up on Wikipedia it'll be good Alice

423
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,260
Waters creator of the Chez Panisse in

424
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,880
San Francisco she also wrote a bunch of

425
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,590
cookbooks and she was kind of this San

426
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,789
Francisco founder of like hey we're just

427
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:51,769
gonna grow our own food and use it in

428
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,600
our restaurant Michael Pollan I don't

429
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,649
know if you've ever read The Omnivore's

430
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:55,279
Dilemma

431
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,019
but a lot of what I am talking about

432
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,659
here today I learned from that book and

433
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:02,679
a couple other books Carlo Petrini

434
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,570
he is actually the Italian founder of

435
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,279
the slow food movement which is an

436
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,440
actual thing an actual organization but

437
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,260
now has worldwide locations dan barber

438
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,080
okay you go home today you're gonna go

439
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,120
home everyone watches TED Talks right or

440
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,710
most of you guys come on we're all smart

441
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,970
people we like watching them on the

442
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,740
train whatever

443
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,210
Dan barber did to TED talks I just

444
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,830
wanted some food conference that they

445
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,350
have on Ted calm and then he did one

446
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,269
this past year and it's amazing if you

447
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,919
if you're interested in food at all go

448
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,460
talk to him

449
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,279
Michael Ruhlman okay Michael Ruhlman

450
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:37,690
Douglas Crockford Michael Ruhlman

451
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,950
Douglas Crockford is to JavaScript as

452
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,510
Michael Ruhlman is to charcuterie

453
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,889
you know JavaScript and good parts

454
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:44,510
Michael Ruhlman book wrote this book

455
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,340
called charcuterie which is like the

456
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,590
manual he did all this research and met

457
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,059
all these guys and all this research to

458
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:51,840
find what how do you

459
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,549
these old-school meats and how do you

460
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:55,770
cure these old-school meats so those are

461
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,110
two guys they're like brothers once ones

462
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,150
got kind of like a Dan Brown thing going

463
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,679
on and you know good ol crock-pot anyway

464
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,529
so we're going to take it back a little

465
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:09,059
bit and get something maybe you guys are

466
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,350
actually interested in because I've been

467
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,840
boring you about bacon for a while but

468
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,730
the Heritage and slow food movements

469
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,370
have kind of a lot of tenants and things

470
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,529
that they kind of talk about all the

471
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:22,529
time and three of those that I bring to

472
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:24,419
I bring to heart our sustainability

473
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:30,240
respect and knowledge so we're gonna

474
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,669
talk about those in terms of code and in

475
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:35,750
terms of also in terms of food but I

476
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,309
think we'll go back to what those

477
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,809
actually mean but just think about those

478
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:42,299
for a sec so but what I wanted what I

479
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,500
really wanted to come here and talk

480
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,270
about when he asked me to do bacon talk

481
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,559
it's like I gotta put some kind of

482
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,299
message in there I got to leave you guys

483
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,130
day one with some kind of message that's

484
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,980
not just specifically bacon related so

485
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,850
the message I want to leave with you

486
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,929
guys with is about how can we use these

487
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,570
things that are principles that have

488
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,309
made the slow food movement and the

489
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,559
heritage food movements so powerful in

490
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,179
this day and age and bring them to our

491
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,429
own lives in our own work because we're

492
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:12,649
not all shark routiers

493
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:15,330
so we can't always use them day to day

494
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,890
but how can we use them in the code

495
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,480
world so what I want to tell you is that

496
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,520
JavaScript is the pig of programming

497
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,870
languages they're like what does that

498
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,440
even mean

499
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,600
javascript is the pig because of these

500
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,100
three things which are all really the

501
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,149
same thing if you read them really

502
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:35,360
carefully but basically javascript is

503
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,770
it's versatile meaning like you can it

504
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,289
has so many uses and it's also I mean I

505
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:42,149
think JavaScript is a noble beasts in

506
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:43,980
some ways it it won't hurt you

507
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,710
necessarily it's only its cage it's it's

508
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,590
it's maybe its producers like our

509
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,710
friends at MSFT who will who will you

510
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,049
know make it not so good and make it

511
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,880
hurt us but or give us the will give us

512
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,480
some kind of disease anyway so anyway

513
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,580
it's it's got many many uses now we know

514
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,400
it can be used on this

515
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,080
xiety can be used on the client-side it

516
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,150
can be used basically anywhere bacon

517
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,010
lardons as I said trade for beer

518
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:16,350
whatever so more more JavaScript here so

519
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,150
what I was saying I want to copy kind of

520
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,890
the core beliefs of slow food and bring

521
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,960
them into JavaScript so what's what does

522
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,490
that mean sustainability so

523
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,580
sustainability in in slow food terms

524
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,230
means means like how do we how do we

525
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,810
treat the animals and how do we treat

526
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,460
the production of the food in a way

527
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,830
that's not gonna kill us or not gonna

528
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,430
hurt us 30 years down the line in terms

529
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,440
of like bacon it's as we're talking

530
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,990
about it's you know injecting pork belly

531
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,050
with brine isn't gonna do us very good

532
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,630
thirty years from now in America being

533
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,610
the most obese nation in the world right

534
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,310
it's not doing us very good and how do

535
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,130
we and also you know feeding them corn

536
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,480
that's not sustainable corn is only

537
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,460
cheap because of this crazy surplus what

538
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,660
we have how do we make something

539
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,730
sustainable so in terms of code in terms

540
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,040
of JavaScript sustainability is not

541
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,600
equal to unit testing in the Ruby

542
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,590
community there's this really weird

543
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,660
thing I'm a Rubeus by day two for the

544
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,940
most part I do a lot of JavaScript but I

545
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,860
got into JavaScript primarily through

546
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,250
Ruby in the Ruby world there's this

547
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,290
weird thing where everybody it's like

548
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,440
this big circle jerk of unit testing

549
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,230
where everyone is constantly saying and

550
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,450
I'm gonna get some chalk and for

551
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,900
that but but but that's cool you guys

552
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,520
are my bros right basically everyone's

553
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,830
like the only way that we can make code

554
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,960
that last ten years from now is if we

555
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,420
you know write user stories and test it

556
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,220
and have this automated test suite then

557
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,080
we know that you know ten years from now

558
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,580
or five years from now when our app is

559
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,780
still running because it's gonna be

560
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,110
running in ten years here right we have

561
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,000
our unit test and we can prove that it's

562
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,920
working and that's not sustainability

563
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,210
sustainability is about same code and

564
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,520
same developers and that means writing

565
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,590
code that's readable writing code that

566
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,470
people actually like working with it

567
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,620
means treating developers like you would

568
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,050
treat that heirloom pig or that Wagyu

569
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,750
beef cow and you feed them

570
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,150
and you feed them a lot of delicious

571
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,490
grains and you treat them really well so

572
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,110
that in the end they will produce some

573
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,400
really awesome code for you

574
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,120
it also means coding for fun and coding

575
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,070
for the sake of code and not just coding

576
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,280
for the sake of you know these five

577
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,340
lines in this JavaScript function are

578
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,720
gonna make me a million dollars or

579
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,950
Twitter's gonna make me other dollars

580
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,300
it's not sure that's gonna put the bacon

581
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,610
on your table but it's not gonna make

582
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,140
you feel good at the end of the day and

583
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,240
to be sis to have a sustainable

584
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,800
environment where we're constantly

585
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,300
working on JavaScript and constantly

586
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,280
looking at code that code has to be fun

587
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,510
there has to be something that we find

588
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,460
in it that's actually fun and that's one

589
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,480
of the reasons I love this conference

590
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,330
because everyone has such a good time

591
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,000
and not because not because it's well

592
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,710
factored or saves time we're not just

593
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,620
talking about like writing code

594
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,820
generators or doing something like that

595
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,010
we're talking about really thinking

596
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,490
about what this code means for us down

597
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,790
the line coding for glory

598
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,210
you know we're coding because if you

599
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,930
code enough and then also have an

600
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,090
obsession with cured foods you might get

601
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,370
to speak at Jay s comp right so there's

602
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,730
some kind of glory in that - respect -

603
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,110
and so in terms of this slow food

604
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,630
movement respect you'll hear if you

605
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,920
watch a lot of Food Network these days

606
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,930
or read Gourmet magazine rest in peace

607
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,130
or read Cook's Illustrated you'll you'll

608
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,690
hear a lot of this thing where they keep

609
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,940
saying respect for ingredients or we

610
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,770
have respect for ingredients respect for

611
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,140
the local ingredients and our respect

612
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,180
for our food and we respect the

613
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,650
traditions it's constantly the word

614
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,510
respect is thrown around a lot and what

615
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,750
that really means is I'm gonna take this

616
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,700
beautiful piece of bacon and I'm not

617
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,010
going to cover it in general Chow sauce

618
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,400
that's what it means really it means

619
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,540
here is this beautiful thing that I've

620
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,300
worked really hard on and I'm gonna put

621
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,980
it out there and I'm gonna respect it in

622
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,150
a way and treat it in a way that that it

623
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,750
deserves

624
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,679
basically so for a code that means code

625
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,020
is a craft so if I'm talking about being

626
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,610
an amateur shark Kuti a

627
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:37,620
in my code life it means and wait all

628
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,830
right rewind when you go on my github

629
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,419
page and you start looking at all the

630
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,220
crappy Ruby code I've written and you're

631
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,840
gonna be like not every piece of code

632
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,919
you're gonna put out there is going to

633
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,269
be this most beautiful thing that's not

634
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:53,669
the point the point is is if you treat

635
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:56,570
the code that you're writing as this

636
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,700
operation as this process of making

637
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,440
something that will last and making

638
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,120
something that you're proud of in the

639
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,960
end of the day as like a craftsman then

640
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,299
then that that's what we need because

641
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,010
otherwise we're all going to burn out or

642
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,720
we're gonna keep putting crappy code out

643
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,450
there so treat your projects like you're

644
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,269
occurring bacon you have to do it think

645
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,639
about it put the effort into it marinate

646
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,889
it cure it wait a little bit come back

647
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:26,309
cook it up it's going to be good which

648
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:28,889
means you know not and that means not

649
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:31,080
only like I said respecting the code

650
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,370
itself and respecting the code as a

651
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,200
craft but also respecting the pace of

652
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,419
you're writing a code don't just throw

653
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,190
some crap out there because you need to

654
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,779
have this latest open source thing in

655
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:43,169
out there it's cool if you want to write

656
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:45,389
a router for node or a framework for

657
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:47,039
node and put it out there that's awesome

658
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,529
I think we should all write node routers

659
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:52,500
but in the end of the day if you're not

660
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,330
if you don't have respect for the code

661
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,580
itself and you're not going and you're

662
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,899
not treating the project that you've

663
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,610
created with respect no one's gonna

664
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,940
respect your code either and the way the

665
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,240
open-source success and an open-source

666
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,679
to have a community to build a community

667
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,919
about around your project is being a

668
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,539
code craftsman it really makes a

669
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:15,480
difference and I think Ryan of node is

670
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,389
like the epitome of code craftsman where

671
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:20,340
he spent so much time thinking about

672
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,700
every single detail of the project and

673
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,230
rewriting it and rethinking it and

674
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,909
turning it and making it awesome and

675
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:29,700
when it comes out it's going to be the

676
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,389
most awesome bacon you've ever had but

677
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:36,570
as spider-man said or spider-man's Uncle

678
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,220
Ben Uncle Ben said with great power

679
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,669
comes great responsibility so if you're

680
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:43,139
treating your code as a craft and you're

681
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,760
putting all this stuff out there just

682
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,920
like in the

683
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,960
world if you don't respect the code and

684
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,010
you put a lot of code out there that

685
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,530
doesn't really mean something at some

686
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,240
point someone's actually going to use it

687
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,100
and then you're gonna have to support it

688
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,200
that's how it is starting on the day of

689
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,270
github when you put everything out there

690
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,800
someone's going to use it and file an

691
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,290
issue on your project this was just a

692
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,790
joke

693
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,070
and that's that's your problem you have

694
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,410
to be responsible

695
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,780
so probably the key point that I wanted

696
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,520
to you guys take away from this is the

697
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,500
idea of knowledge and knowledge of food

698
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,580
so I just waxed on for about 40 minutes

699
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,640
about bacon and what the hell is up with

700
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,540
that

701
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,900
I gained that knowledge because I cared

702
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,670
about it and when I looked at the when I

703
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,140
looked at the bacon and I was eating

704
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,720
this food I was like what makes this

705
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,760
good and what makes this what it is in

706
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,220
the food world this is knowledge of not

707
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,020
only the food and the process itself but

708
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,460
knowledge of the past and knowledge of

709
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,070
what's come before you because there's

710
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,860
this guy in New Jersey right

711
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,780
hypothetical situation comes back one

712
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,580
day at his house you know he was raising

713
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,930
some pigs in his backyard

714
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,390
one day he kills the pig and forgets

715
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,620
that he killed it and just leaves in his

716
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,330
backyard and he also happens to live

717
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,800
near a salt mine this is actually the

718
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,120
story of how bacon was supposedly

719
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,930
created in France by the way and he he

720
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,000
just leaves it there and it falls into

721
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,060
the like rolls into the salt line and

722
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,790
then ten ten years later are not tending

723
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,410
to ten ten weeks later he comes back and

724
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,910
it's like wow huh

725
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,950
this pig doesn't have maggots on it

726
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,840
maybe I'll eat it any good that's that's

727
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,020
the that's the story of bacon ten weeks

728
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,560
later so and so anyway the point is is

729
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,810
that if a guy in New Jersey did that

730
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:34,160
yesterday or you know he he did it

731
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,020
because he had no idea what he was doing

732
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,140
not because it was an accident so when

733
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,030
you discover when I discovered oh wow we

734
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,830
can route on the hashtag and make single

735
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,900
page applications I was a idiot

736
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,730
because people had done this for so long

737
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,890
already and I was just like a noob who

738
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,630
figured this out and then found a good

739
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,360
way to to wrap it up in a project but

740
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,030
the point is is if you really want to be

741
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,280
a talented open source developer and a

742
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,000
time to develop

743
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,830
in general you have to have knowledge of

744
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,100
the past so and this also means never

745
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,120
code something without learning

746
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,669
something from it so if you're gonna

747
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:10,100
write that node router and you're just

748
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,600
basically copying and pasting code but

749
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,890
then changing a couple lines because you

750
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,200
think it's better and you don't learn

751
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,090
anything from it then there was no point

752
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,159
of doing it originally this needs

753
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:20,690
sharpen your butchers and I sharpen your

754
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,400
mind is your butcher butcher's knife

755
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,340
knowledge is the tool not a tool the

756
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,860
tool that will get you a the job that

757
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,360
you want which will make the projects

758
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,809
that you want to do and more

759
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,120
specifically know what you're doing in

760
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,679
the code world know what you're doing

761
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:37,789
when you're using other people's tool

762
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:40,130
tools so if you're using node look at

763
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,049
the source code read it if you're using

764
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:44,510
Sam you look at the source code just our

765
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,400
jQuery especially jQuery source code is

766
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,890
pretty readable read it think about it

767
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,510
know what's going on in there because

768
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,809
that'll only make you better for it so

769
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:55,880
here's here's the here's the final

770
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,820
thought I want to leave you it so if we

771
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,700
say that the pig our JavaScript is the

772
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,090
pig of the language world what is the

773
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,690
bacon of the JavaScript world and I

774
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,070
think hopefully we'll figure that out

775
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,929
this weekend it's not a one-time thing

776
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,630
it's not like bacon done JavaScript's

777
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:18,530
over it's more about constantly striving

778
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,559
to make a project and make code that you

779
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,990
feel is worthy of this of this

780
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,049
description so that's it thanks you guys

781
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:32,360
for listening I hope you had a good time
