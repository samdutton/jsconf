1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,759

when I was asked to NC I've never done

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,349
this before and I actually as I

3
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:13,969
mentioned before never been to CSS comp

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:17,600
for CSS conference so I was really

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,180
excited to come and and I was trying to

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,300
think like well how would I end such a

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,930
great like group of speakers and and I

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,700
don't know I just I feel really inspired

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,310
and and I was going to talk about like

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,160
my wish list for like what I want in the

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,769
future is CSS but I realized I feel like

12
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:39,769
we've tapped out CSS as a language I

13
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:43,909
think we've done it all and I my

14
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:47,059
backgrounds started in academia and then

15
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,420
I worked in sports media tech at the NBA

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,589
and a couple of the main thing I learned

17
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:58,670
from working in those industries is how

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,749
to monetize things so I figure like

19
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:05,210
instead of talking about like what i

20
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,820
want for CSS i would give you some of my

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,270
ideas on how maybe we should monetize

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,939
CSS so that's what i'm going to talk

23
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,439
about and so I have a I have a couple

24
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,270
ideas bear with me they might sound a

25
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,250
little crazy but like I was going over

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,689
my slides before and now I'm sorry to

27
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:21,860
think like you know what I think I've

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,079
got like a good couple of ideas rolling

29
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,219
and what better place in CSS confer we

30
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,840
have all these great minds here that

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,700
work at really cool places that can make

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,520
decisions and make these things happen

33
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,920
and who here would think it's a cool

34
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,130
idea if we all made more money yeah so

35
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,159
important is the first thing I want to

36
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,710
talk about originally my wish list or

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,740
CSS is to get rid of important important

38
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,270
causes me a lot of stress and it

39
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,070
probably does for you especially when

40
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,560
you pull in third party libraries that

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,079
have CSS files and they used important

42
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,210
on all of them and you know it's a pain

43
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,789
the butt but like instead of getting rid

44
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,950
of it like we could just make it harder

45
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,840
for people to use by monetizing it like

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,100
and so like how can we monetize in

47
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,170
Horton's like what is important it's

48
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,420
like some weird like social construct

49
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,850
that we can totally take advantage of so

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,420
I said I propose that we introduce some

51
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,540
politics and bureaucracy into important

52
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,000
so like we can create the sort of like

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,430
government of CSS politicians who pass

54
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,110
laws on what can be important and what

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,680
cannot be important and i put democracy

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,270
and scare quotes because really like we

57
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,770
don't know how to do that sort of stuff

58
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,710
but like some people might say like oh

59
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,170
well good the w3c like we can handle it

60
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,370
but like I feel like they're a little

61
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,230
distracted right now so maybe like we

62
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,510
can just do like a total qu and take

63
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,450
over ourselves and create another group

64
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,130
we all know like the more groups you

65
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,780
have deciding the same thing obviously

66
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,780
is like the best approach so figure we

67
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,460
should contribute to that and like in

68
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,050
terms of bureaucracy and these are all

69
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,280
things that I learned working at

70
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,890
Montclair CA and MBA like in order to

71
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,510
like make it difficult to do something

72
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,580
we actually make people apply for it or

73
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,770
put it behind a paywall or we can create

74
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,840
these loose rules and never-ending

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,870
debate between our cool little democracy

76
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,600
and bury people in paperwork before

77
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,780
they're able to use important in their

78
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,870
code and of course like but the great

79
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,280
thing about politics is that it always

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,970
means more jobs and more money not

81
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,070
necessarily distributed to us developers

82
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,470
but the people in power because when you

83
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,060
have power you get money and when you

84
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,380
have money and power e of respect and

85
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,820
this is something little kimsin telling

86
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,240
me since 1998 so it obviously is

87
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,580
something we should look into z-index

88
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,150
this is my favorite CSS property because

89
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,600
i love like math and the Z plane and all

90
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,840
that cool stuff but we can totally

91
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,200
monetize the z-index the more money that

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,540
you pay the more stacks you can have I

93
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,150
mean my default for Z index is like 99

94
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,610
999 up until like even beyond what a

95
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,320
computer can technically handle it with

96
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,070
32-bit integers so like if we charge

97
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,260
people for how high their z-index codes

98
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,960
well if you have a lot of layers you

99
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,850
know you're going to have to pay more so

100
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,100
and I mean I don't know exactly who

101
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,440
they're going to pay like us wherever we

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,570
are but I figured that's a good idea

103
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,000
yeah that's that's all the money that

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,250
we're going to be making if we do this

105
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,700
my favorite subject ever SC oh right

106
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,720
yeah how can we monetize with SEO well

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,990
like SEO just automatically means money

108
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,990
anyway so like I have this I actually

109
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,510
wrote some code I hope you can see and

110
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,640
like it doesn't really like to the when

111
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,810
you're viewing in the browser doesn't

112
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,610
actually do anything like this code is

113
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,820
useless but if we can incorporate like

114
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,250
search optimization and box and stuff so

115
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,990
like Paul like see me later we can

116
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,670
discuss how Google wants to work this

117
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,140
into their roadmap but like why don't we

118
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,720
just like class name stuff everything

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,940
and then like everyone will definitely

120
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,970
go to my site that's styled by the CSS

121
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,250
and like you can inject like your name

122
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,440
and like all this sort of stuff into CSS

123
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,600
you put into client projects and then

124
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,730
you get more clicks and then the

125
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,080
internet gives you more money because

126
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,030
that's like where this money is coming

127
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:39,090
from the internet javascript and CSS so

128
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,490
like on the JavaScript developer yeah

129
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,700
boo and like we all know that like CSS

130
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,230
really don't need CSS is a language we

131
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,210
can do everything in CSS or JavaScript

132
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,810
so I mean let's just get that out there

133
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,860
performance and all that other stuff

134
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,620
like aside like you know JavaScript can

135
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,710
do it but like let's turn the tables on

136
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,140
JavaScript developers like let's create

137
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,780
a syntax and CSS where we can put

138
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,860
JavaScript into the page so like I mean

139
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,250
I I've come from a background in PHP

140
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,960
development so like why don't we use

141
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,420
like PHP to parse this and inject it

142
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,550
just seems like it's totally easy and

143
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,000
not tasking it also we can do that and

144
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,210
make money through CSS that has

145
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,850
javascript in it so like how would we do

146
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,270
that well let's rebrand it people

147
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,620
whenever you like your work in a company

148
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,040
that

149
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,600
markets things and like this happens at

150
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,190
sports seems all the time to let go you

151
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,690
know ticket sales aren't so good like

152
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,340
what should we do like oh let's change

153
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,050
the name of the team and that will like

154
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,340
totally like blow it up and it usually

155
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,520
works that way so like let's rename CSS

156
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,650
with JavaScript syntax inside of it and

157
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,460
called script we can have like t-shirts

158
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,610
and like framework Wars because all of

159
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,170
the money that I make off of web

160
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,700
development is actually from arguing

161
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,510
about code on Twitter so like we all can

162
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,400
get involved in with this rebranding I

163
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,470
mentioned in the beginning of the

164
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,690
conference that CSS is a line language

165
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,370
because you know what you see on the

166
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,380
document you end up looking at your page

167
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,270
in the browser and it turns out it's

168
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,580
just full of lies so I feel like if we

169
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,620
want to be taken more seriously a CSS

170
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,210
developers and therefore make more money

171
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,600
we need to sort of stop being a big fat

172
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,130
liars all the time and I treated this a

173
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,570
couple of days ago I was actually really

174
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,100
stressed out I was working on a project

175
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,200
where we were sorting a column and

176
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,740
there's CSS triangles pointing up when

177
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,810
you sort of sunday and would change down

178
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,310
and I'm struggling with that and then i

179
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,200
was like thinking like why are we

180
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,810
calling these triangles like they're not

181
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,610
triangles like if you take a look at

182
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,790
this code it's only hiding parts of this

183
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,550
box you know so like I'm standing behind

184
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,350
this podium and you don't see my legs

185
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,700
you're not going to call me someone who

186
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,550
doesn't have legs so like why are we

187
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,320
lying about triangles it drives me

188
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,450
insane like this is that triangle and

189
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,350
CSS and like why don't we just use like

190
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,030
HTML which this is obviously more

191
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,100
semantic I take a look at ampersand hash

192
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,830
x.25 be too and I'm like oh that's an up

193
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,470
we're pointing solid triangle so and

194
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,140
it's like so much less code and you know

195
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,760
and yeah we might have to memorize all

196
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,740
these entities but like what else are we

197
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,990
going to do so that's a little taste of

198
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,419
my upcoming talk a deprecated CSS cove

199
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,979
where we just get rid of all CSS so yeah

200
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,460
NHL mods modernization is really easy we

201
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,650
just introduced politics bureaucracy and

202
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,120
just like basically not use CSS at all

203
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,890
also like again like let's stop calling

204
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,350
them triangles

205
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,630
and just like doing whatever I say it's

206
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,550
I feel like anybody that's listen to me

207
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,800
like usually gets it right along the way

208
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,530
so I don't know and also like on a

209
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,200
