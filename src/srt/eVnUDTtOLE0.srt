00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:16,109

so hi again I'm Lea

2
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,109
so I was introduced quite nicely thank

3
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,020
you but here's a fun fact you don't know

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,400
about me I grew up in the Greek island

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,449
of Lesbos which technically makes me

6
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,759
geographically lesbian this is something

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,980
that not many people know about me so if

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,360
you've ever heard about me before it's

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
probably from one of my open-source

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,290
projects

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,670
I'm also the census working group which

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,039
just means that I've gotten better at

13
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,079
spending increasing amounts of time

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,270
discussing issues of decreasing

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,379
importance and then the last year I've

16
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,510
been exploring the wondrous world of

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,100
academia and trying my luck at research

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,989
I'm doing a human-computer interaction

19
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,760
research basically trying to make it

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,810
easier to create web applications mainly

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,030
data-driven web applications so enough

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,479
about me

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,380
oh and I've written the book if you have

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,560
it I can sign it just find me in one of

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,090
the breaks or the party so enough about

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:24,600
me

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,590
let's move on to something more

28
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,890
interesting such as pie charts pie

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,650
charts are everywhere in xkcd in old

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,360
windows on walls on genitals on food on

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,150
blackboards and of course there they're

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,939
very ubiquitous on the web we see pie

33
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,030
charts all the time elf wave for evil to

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,780
show percentages or just as spinners to

35
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,299
for as a loading indicator but still

36
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,220
it's surprisingly difficult to make them

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,290
with web technologies for example look

38
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,479
at this very very simple pie chart this

39
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,670
is what we'll be working on for most of

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,490
this talk how can we make this pie chart

41
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,079
with web technologies it's super simple

42
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,210
it's just two colors it should be very

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,500
easy right can you think of a solution

44
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,180
can you try to think about it for a bit

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,920
just a very simple tight

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,690
thing needs to go it needs to show one

47
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,599
percentage from zero to 100% how would

48
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,510
you do it so when I thought about it my

49
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,250
first idea was okay we need to show

50
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,660
custom angles in some way

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,590
let's try skew transforms so we start

52
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,780
with a square element we give it a

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,569
border radius of 50% to make it round

54
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,489
and then we add a pseudo element with an

55
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,890
empty content we position it absolutely

56
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,209
let's give it a background as well to

57
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,590
see what we're doing right now it won't

58
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,080
show because it has no dimensions bottom

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,160
50% left

60
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,600
50% and let's give it a padding of 50%

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,459
as well now we're starting to see it

62
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,620
let's give this overflow:hidden so that

63
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,269
it doesn't obscure our code and it looks

64
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:13,799
more like a pie chart so this already

65
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:16,739
looks like a pie chart with 25% more

66
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,190
scape like most times the 1 25% won't be

67
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,359
what we want

68
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,840
so this is where transforms come in

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,980
let's try skewing transform so we're

70
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,269
sort of starting to get there but not

71
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,100
quite because this is not exactly

72
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,410
staying in the center but you know how

73
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,120
to fix that right we just use the

74
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:46,590
transform origin or bottom left and now

75
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,290
it looks more like a pie chart

76
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,130
hey thank you but wait a bit because yes

77
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,560
we can show different percentages but as

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,030
it grows it starts showing the problems

79
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,410
which you we can sort of patch by

80
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,800
increasing the bad thing but at some

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,890
point it will come back to bite us we

82
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,330
can increase the padding even more

83
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,910
whether I can't make it infinite so that

84
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,120
90 degrees it will disappear but we can

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,190
sort of get around that we can special

86
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,450
case everything we can special case 50%

87
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,860
because it's easy to just give it a

88
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,960
different colour and have the the on

89
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,660
half the the circle the difficult part

90
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,730
was showing the angles right and we can

91
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,900
give it a SAN over half class and apply

92
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,400
and change the transform and append the

93
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,020
color and swap the colors to show

94
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,320
percentages over 50% so we can we can

95
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,850
sort of do it with skewed suit of

96
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,620
elements so there I sold it I made pie

97
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,670
charts with CSS is it good is it a good

98
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,380
solution would you work would you want

99
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,510
to work on this code would anybody want

100
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,750
to work on this code doesn't it make you

101
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,820
feel dirty that we used CSS and that in

102
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,020
such a way and pure CSS is not good

103
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,600
enough just using CSS to mate is to just

104
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,170
claim hey I did this with pure CSS so

105
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,080
what will you CSS because of its the

106
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,700
clarity of reactive nature because

107
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,290
sometimes it actually helps us simplify

108
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,050
our code just being able to do something

109
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,810
in CSS without actually ending up with

110
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,030
code that's maintainable or or even

111
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,350
understandable that what the hell does

112
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,360
this do how do I set this pie charts to

113
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,630
show 30% I will have to say think that

114
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,360
Oh minus 90 degrees was zero and then 90

115
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,720
degrees was 50% so 30 bit seriously

116
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,030
nobody wants to think to think like that

117
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,860
usually we should just be able we should

118
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,940
be able to just set a straightforward

119
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,910
number so to sorry for a super CSS

120
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,830
solution to actually be a good idea it

121
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,270
needs to be flexible it needs to be

122
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,950
maintainable and ideally it should be

123
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,140
extensible that's not as important but

124
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,770
it should be it's

125
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,250
good thing if it's also extensible and

126
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,240
flexibility means multiple things such

127
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,789
as is it possible to change things what

128
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,009
things well you can sort of foresee what

129
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,720
you might want to change about something

130
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,569
in the pie chart example you might want

131
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:20,970
to change the colors or of course you

132
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,490
will want to set the percentage so these

133
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,759
things should be possible to change but

134
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,930
it shouldn't they should just be

135
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,610
possible to change it should be possible

136
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,280
to change them in line ideally because a

137
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,470
lot of the time we'll have a widget that

138
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,560
we stylist with CSS and then we change

139
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,819
something with JavaScript and with

140
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,620
JavaScript we can only set inline Styles

141
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,110
yes with CSS variables that won't be a

142
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,849
big problem because we can just set the

143
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,440
CSS variable and then we can use it in

144
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,199
pseudo elements so that won't be a

145
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,849
problem but right now if we need to

146
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:52,560
change something in a pseudo element to

147
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,199
modify the percentage that's a problem

148
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,060
because we can't in like we can't set

149
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,130
pseudo elements by inline Styles and if

150
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,000
you're wondering by the way CSS

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,750
variables have pretty bad browser

152
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,340
support right now so it's still a

153
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,699
concern so and also it's not just about

154
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:15,960
being possible to change and being

155
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,610
possible to change it in line but also

156
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,250
how easy is it to change and how many

157
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,039
places do I have to change stuff to make

158
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,259
a simple edit because the more edits I

159
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,240
have to do the more the more likely it

160
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,699
is that I will forget one and or that

161
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,380
the future developer after me will

162
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,630
forget one or they will not even know

163
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,639
how that they need to make changes all

164
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,710
over the place so it's software

165
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,360
engineering this is called don't repeat

166
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,440
yourself

167
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,080
so the acronym is dry dry code is a good

168
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,909
thing strive to make your code as dry as

169
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,680
possible the opposite who's wet by the

170
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,039
way we enjoy typing good CSS solutions

171
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,139
should also be maintainable which is

172
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,520
also sort of it's hard to define but a

173
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,719
heuristic and it's just a heuristic

174
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,849
because you can have tons of code that

175
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,440
is very understandable very well

176
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,259
commented it's just a rule of thumb the

177
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,199
more code usually the more effort it

178
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,839
takes to understand it also in the case

179
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,300
of HTML CSS does it require

180
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,889
extra elements do I need to add extra

181
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:18,930
elements to make this work that's a

182
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,569
problem because it makes I have to it I

183
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,039
have to change two things to make the

184
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,129
solution work so it's sort of it it's

185
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,629
more things that I have to know about

186
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,080
the code to work on it and is it

187
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,909
straightforward that's which which

188
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,760
cannot be strictly defined but you know

189
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,260
when the code you've written is not

190
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,969
straightforward right you know that this

191
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:41,190
to skew the pseudo-element example is

192
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,829
not straightforward in any definition of

193
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:47,459
the word right it's it feels hacky it

194
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,140
feels bad it feels like this is not what

195
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,149
we should be doing that means it's

196
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,800
usually it's not maintainable and

197
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,140
extensibility is how easy it is to add

198
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,089
more things in the future how easy is it

199
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,519
to extend what it does for example in

200
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,250
the in the pie chart case can I add

201
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,990
multiple segments what if I don't want

202
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,579
to just show one percentage but I want

203
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:10,230
to show multiple that's it something

204
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,930
that we can foresee doing can we do it

205
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,850
or do we have to completely change how

206
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,310
we're styling our pie chart also can we

207
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,320
have a patient can can we animate either

208
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,510
the whole thing and make and turn it

209
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,000
into a spinner or just the pie the pie

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
segments as they appear can we show them

211
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,550
with a transition or can I have effect

212
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,990
can I color the segments with gradients

213
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,020
for instance or patterns or something so

214
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,320
in the case of the skewed Suellen pseudo

215
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,050
elements yeah I can change the colors in

216
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,740
one place I can change the size in one

217
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,560
place I need to make four edits to

218
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,829
change the value ah well in the simple

219
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:54,660
case I can only make one at it if I'm

220
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,910
changing it from 10% to 20% in the

221
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,310
general case I need to make four edits

222
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,329
if if it goes from below 50% to above

223
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:06,089
50% and it's not possible to set the

224
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:08,250
value in line because my transform is in

225
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,779
the pseudo element so I can't set that

226
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,079
in line the good thing is it's not using

227
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,570
any extra elements it is using 14

228
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,160
declaration in four rules which for a

229
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,769
simple tried pie chart are a bit too

230
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:22,800
many and it's terribly messy in hockey

231
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,899
most importantly extensibility wise I

232
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:28,320
can sort

233
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,790
have multiple segments I can sort of

234
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,380
animate I can sort of do some effects

235
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,390
it's a pain in the ass to do any of

236
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,650
these so it's sort of okay but still

237
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,720
overall the skewed sewer element is a

238
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,190
bad idea can we do better let's let's

239
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,410
try to think of a better idea how can we

240
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,440
show custom angles in a circle in CSS

241
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,500
how could we show custom angles we we

242
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,180
try to secure transforms it didn't work

243
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,190
very well what else do we have

244
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,390
we have rotations can we do it can we

245
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,370
make it work with rotations what if we

246
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,650
call it our circle half of it being our

247
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,600
base color this f06

248
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,720
this magenta and the other half being

249
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,970
gold stay with me here

250
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:25,200
so let's try to do that for a bit so now

251
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
I have a gradient but it would turn it

252
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,770
will turn into what I've described very

253
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:39,390
quickly so these will come together and

254
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,490
actually this doesn't even need to be 50

255
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,290
it could be anything it could be zero as

256
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,580
long as it's smaller than the previous

257
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,210
one it works so I will tend to use zero

258
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,520
and all the in any gradients you might

259
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,190
see in the future in this talk it just

260
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,170
means it's equal to the previous one the

261
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,460
browser does this for you so you don't

262
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,620
have to type it twice so there I've

263
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,410
colored my circle with two colors so now

264
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,730
what if I add a pseudo element that is

265
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:12,800
also magenta f06 let's set this and I

266
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,320
move it to the side by margin left 50% I

267
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,620
give it a height of a hundred percent

268
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,890
and of course now it's square I could

269
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,540
either solve it this by overflow:hidden

270
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,350
or I could solve this by nice use of

271
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,390
border radius so I want to make it a

272
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,720
semi circle right so 50% won't work what

273
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,490
will work is if I use the extended

274
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,130
border radius syntax which lets me set

275
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:41,730
the different

276
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,829
on every corner both horizontally and

277
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,769
vertically so I let's think about it I

278
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,480
want a semicircle on the bright side so

279
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,980
the top right the top left corner is

280
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,589
zero has has no rounding horizontally

281
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:59,010
the top bright one has a hundred percent

282
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,139
the bottom right one has a hundred

283
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,360
percent and the top-right one has a

284
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,310
hundred percent and sorry zero and

285
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,170
vertically it's fifty percent so there

286
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,170
we have it I can give it a different

287
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,190
color if you don't believe me that this

288
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,430
is actually my element it is my element

289
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,380
so it's a semicircle now and this is

290
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,860
where the magic begins because now I can

291
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,449
start rotating it and it's almost almost

292
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:29,850
getting there what do I need transform

293
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:36,649
origin which will be on the left center

294
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,570
so left and there it is now so you might

295
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,370
be wondering why is this better than the

296
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,230
previous one well for one I don't have

297
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,360
weird artifacts when I get to a hundred

298
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,160
and eighty I just need to change one

299
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,940
thing and it works and also it still

300
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,790
needs us it still needs a class to get

301
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,500
to the show percentages over 50 percent

302
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,329
ha but the only thing that's needed here

303
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,139
to show percentages over 50 percent is

304
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,750
to set a background of gold to my pseudo

305
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,329
element and then I can show any

306
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:19,110
percentage I want over 50 percent see

307
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,000
the bottom pile I can show any

308
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,490
percentage I want on it so it's sort of

309
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,990
slightly slightly more straightforward

310
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,910
you might start thinking well I've

311
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,740
repeated my colors and stuff in many

312
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,860
places so that's not very maintainable

313
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,930
yes I have but I can eliminate that

314
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,940
repetition let's eliminate the

315
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,079
repetition so here I've set it to f06

316
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,670
but it's in a gradient so I can't really

317
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,130
use it anywhere else instead I'm gonna

318
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,040
set it to transparent and I'm gonna move

319
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,630
the color as a background color so now

320
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,780
instead of retyping f06 here I can just

321
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,020
inherit but if I just didn't hear it on

322
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,400
the background you see what happens

323
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,170
because it inherits the whole to color

324
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,000
background so I have to show it to

325
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,320
change this the background color also

326
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,700
okay you might be thinking okay you did

327
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,080
this with the background color but what

328
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,240
will you do about gold because otherwise

329
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,250
we would have to repeat it here well

330
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,490
actually we don't because I can just set

331
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,480
the color to gold and then I changed

332
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,190
this gradient color stop to current

333
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,080
color which always refers to the value

334
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,390
of the color property if I change this

335
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:36,620
to say green then it changes in the

336
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,570
gradient so now I can set this to

337
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,310
current color as well because color is

338
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,870
an inherited property so my studio

339
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,580
element also has a color of gold and now

340
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,330
if I change it it changes in both places

341
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,690
and also I can make this a little more

342
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,230
sensible by using turn units so now this

343
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,240
is 10% and a corresponds to point one

344
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,020
turn so I don't have to do weird weird

345
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,130
math with angles 20% 30% and so on and

346
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,550
yes above above 50%

347
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,710
it would have to reset again like 50%

348
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,890
corresponds to zero turns and 60% is

349
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,620
point one turns but compared to what we

350
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,200
had to endure with the skewed hack with

351
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,260
the skewed element hack that's slightly

352
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,920
better and can I animate it with it with

353
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,250
the skew transform it was a it was a

354
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,170
huge pain to even attempt animation on

355
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,490
it here it's not super straightforward

356
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,550
but we can do it we will need to animate

357
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:51,680
two things the color and the rotation so

358
00:16:51,680 --> 00:17:02,389
the color will go from

359
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,959
we'll alternate between current color

360
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,339
and inherit and the spender rotation

361
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:17,589
will also will go from 0 to 0.5 tonnes

362
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:22,480
and we have to remove this one it just

363
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,550
gets the default of 0 by the way you

364
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,250
notice I didn't use from and two key

365
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,260
frames this is because when you don't

366
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,480
specify from a new key frame or from or

367
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,400
two key frames the browser generates

368
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,350
them for you so in this animation the

369
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,630
from key frame is just rotate zero which

370
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,280
is the state of this rule that will

371
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:50,830
apply it on so we set the color over we

372
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,560
animate the color over two seconds

373
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,400
actually let's do it wrong first so that

374
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,360
you see what happens this will be linear

375
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,290
they will both be infinite oh and here

376
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,780
we're doing a background color again not

377
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,520
background so you can see the problem

378
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,679
the caller doesn't actually abruptly

379
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,600
change it smoothly changes which is

380
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,580
usually great this is why we love CSS

381
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,250
animations in this case though we wanted

382
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,010
it to abruptly change it's 50% so what

383
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,830
do we do we specify an animation timing

384
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,240
function of step start and when we apply

385
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,620
it there we have an animating pie chart

386
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,490
now however we might be thinking well

387
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,830
what we actually wanted was not an

388
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,260
animated pie chart it was just a simple

389
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,890
little tiny static pie chart we just

390
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,630
wanted to show different percentages on

391
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:58,630
a static pie chart so what can we do the

392
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,140
thing is the browser knows how to

393
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,870
progress an animation what if we could

394
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,240
just tell the browser stop the animation

395
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,820
at 10 percent or stop the animation at

396
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,290
50 percent stop the animation at 80

397
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:11,820
percent

398
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,500
this is exactly what we want to display

399
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,910
a percentage and then we would be able

400
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,700
to just change one value and display a

401
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,130
custom percentage why don't we have

402
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,930
something like this in CSS like an

403
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,550
interpolate function or something like

404
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,170
this well sadly we don't but we can hack

405
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,860
it with what I call static interpolation

406
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,310
which is not actually a real thing

407
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,170
interpolation is when you is figuring

408
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,150
out the intermediate states between two

409
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,390
keyframes and static just means that I'm

410
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,830
basically going to be using an animation

411
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,530
but nothing will actually animate so

412
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,680
let's let's examine it first on a

413
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,480
simpler animation let's write the

414
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,370
keyframes rule here let's call it foo

415
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,500
and let's make it go from gold to f06

416
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,840
you'll see a lot of f06 here it's my

417
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,810
favorite color

418
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:11,340
so let's attach it here let's give it

419
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:18,680
two seconds or maybe five whatever and

420
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,870
you can see how it switches from gold to

421
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,450
f06 and the browser knows all the

422
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,810
intermediate stages but how could we

423
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,240
make it how could we say I want the

424
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,850
background to be 50% between gold and

425
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,690
f06

426
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,750
there's no function for that however

427
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,710
what we could do is there is a property

428
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,990
animation play state which is by by

429
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,700
default it has the value the value

430
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,710
running but it can get the value post

431
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,770
which poses our animation okay big deal

432
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,060
you might be thinking I would just have

433
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:58,290
gold and nothing else yes but we have

434
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,120
this amazing property called animation

435
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,850
delay which doesn't look like much when

436
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,950
you first see it because it's basically

437
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,680
it may delay your animation by a bit so

438
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,050
we've animated but your normal animation

439
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,240
from gold to f06 would look like this

440
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,540
over time say with a 10 second duration

441
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,120
an animation delay of one second would

442
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,920
shift it over time and it would start

443
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,170
one second later not very useful right

444
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,340
but you can have negative

445
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,590
and delay and what did let what that

446
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,129
does it shifts it on the other direction

447
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:32,720
so you can actually step through your

448
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,779
animation and if your animation is

449
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:38,749
paused what you get is this the study of

450
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:40,909
creams that the browser generated and no

451
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:44,870
animation so let's try this let's use

452
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,360
that seconds here and animation delay

453
00:21:49,360 --> 00:22:01,759
say - 5 seconds so yep I'm not sure if

454
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,639
you if it shows very much but we're

455
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:07,509
basically stepping through the animation

456
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:10,249
it starts showing you an awful lot like

457
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:13,100
f06 after a certain point alright

458
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,659
because we need to make it linear

459
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:18,740
otherwise its accelerates after a

460
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,869
certain point so after 50% the values

461
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:23,029
are very similar so yes this is actually

462
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:28,309
50% between these two colors and let's

463
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:29,869
make it a hundred so that these actually

464
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:31,929
correspond to percentages so this is 50%

465
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:43,220
this is 25% this is 75% and 99% what do

466
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,299
you expect - 100 seconds to show it

467
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:53,509
should show f06 right nope and the

468
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:55,340
reason for that is that basically you're

469
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,139
stepping through the animation as if it

470
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:59,799
actually was it was actually playing

471
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,210
it's just that it's paused but it's it's

472
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,710
the same thing as if it was playing and

473
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,299
what happens to an animation of it after

474
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:07,759
it finishes it snaps back to the

475
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,369
beginning unless you use animation film

476
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:18,830
mode for words and then this means when

477
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,139
the animation ends freeze the last frame

478
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:23,450
and just show me that I don't want you

479
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,710
to snap back to the beginning I don't

480
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,059
want you to do anything just show me the

481
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:27,769
last frame and you don't even need a

482
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:29,360
separate property because it's part of

483
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,889
the animation shorthand so you can just

484
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:36,830
add it here so let's go back to our pie

485
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,150
chart here

486
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,450
let and let's convert it to use

487
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,400
animation delay first we remove the

488
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,250
infinite iterations because we don't

489
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,450
need that anymore we'll just be

490
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,610
statically going through it we do need

491
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,110
to add two iterations here because its

492
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,039
duration is half and then we add

493
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:01,980
forwards to both of them or actually

494
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,450
it's probably best to do a separate

495
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,950
declaration here just so that we don't

496
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,460
repeat it

497
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:21,330
remember dry and animation delay let's

498
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,640
ah let's make this a hundred so that we

499
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,230
actually have numbers that could do

500
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,700
correspond to percentages since the

501
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,549
durations don't really matter anymore

502
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:33,270
and our animation play state as well

503
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,950
because right now you see it's playing

504
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,179
it's very slow but it's still playing

505
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:42,210
let's pause it let's set a delay of say

506
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,500
minus ten seconds and let's reapply it

507
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,559
yes this is ten seconds we want to show

508
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:55,020
20 percent yes this is 20 percent 30

509
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,809
percent and so on we can just set the

510
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:03,900
percentage by changing one number and it

511
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,740
works even at a hundred percent so this

512
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,409
is already a huge improvement you might

513
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:18,230
be thinking though

514
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,980
thank you you might be thinking though

515
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,260
this is inside the pseudo-element we

516
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,820
can't set inline styles and pseudo

517
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,160
elements so okay you made it changeable

518
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,049
by one property but what good does it do

519
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,429
may still can set it by a JavaScript but

520
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:35,260
we don't have an animation on the main

521
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,040
element do we so animation delay on the

522
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,690
main element won't do anything right so

523
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,920
I can just inherit it here and then I

524
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,080
can set it on the main element and this

525
00:25:50,080 --> 00:26:00,539
could be an inline style

526
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:05,120
thank you so rotated pseudo-element

527
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,150
one cut one edit to change the color one

528
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,520
to two edits this change the size one

529
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,990
edit to change the value that's the big

530
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,120
improvement here and we can set it in

531
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,299
line very big improvement it doesn't use

532
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,460
any extra elements still has a lot of

533
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,210
code somewhat less hacky but still can

534
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,150
affordable you can't have multiple

535
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,140
segments that's a pretty big limitation

536
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,330
because you know pie charts often used I

537
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,640
often show multiple percentages it is

538
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,230
possible to animate we've already seen

539
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,230
it we can't really do any effects due to

540
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,940
how it works and this whole happiness of

541
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,400
like uncovering half of the circle know

542
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,260
that maybe we can do a few limited

543
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,330
effects but not really so overall it's

544
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,380
not really that great so can we do

545
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:59,779
better how

546
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:06,220
well we could use SVG and the reason SVG

547
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,409
the thought of using SVG on this would

548
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,570
give most people shivers is because most

549
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,399
people would think of doing pie charts

550
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:16,179
by this way very little CSS and a path

551
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:18,760
with very weird numbers you can see this

552
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,710
path syntax what does it do how does it

553
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,679
work how many people here can understand

554
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,559
what all these numbers here do yeah only

555
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,360
the person who created SVG I can

556
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,240
actually tell you what they do the first

557
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,320
command moves it to 50/50 the the point

558
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,470
50 horizontally and C and 0 vertically

559
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,830
and then it draws an arc with the 50 50

560
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,590
the point 50 comma 50 is its center this

561
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,620
one and it throws an arc with a radius

562
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,350
of 50 to this point which is 40 point 80

563
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,659
on the coordinate system of the SVG

564
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:58,929
which have defined in the view box okay

565
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:00,820
and how do I figure out what point I

566
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,289
want how do I figure out what the end

567
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:05,110
point of the path should be for dica my

568
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,580
idea okay that makes sense because I

569
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,260
actually wanted to show a percentage of

570
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,950
like 30 something percent how do you

571
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,510
figure out these numbers I have to do a

572
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,760
lot of trigonometry and I would really

573
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,490
rather not is there any better solution

574
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:25,630
there is of course so here's an SV

575
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,120
here's another SVG it's it's an it's an

576
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,889
HTML element as well it's an inline SVG

577
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:32,529
so it has a class of Pi I've divided

578
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:35,919
defined its units as 64 width and 64

579
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,690
height you'll see soon why this weird

580
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,460
number it just makes some calculations

581
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,240
easier and it has a circle with 25% its

582
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,360
radius so what can we do with this per

583
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,090
circle we can style it with CSS we can

584
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,149
give it a stroke yeah the SVG version of

585
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:59,799
CSS is a little different we can cancel

586
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,210
its fill so that we don't have this

587
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,710
horrible none this horrible black we can

588
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:11,320
set stroke width and one is the default

589
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,230
where we can make it thicker

590
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,629
and there's also another property called

591
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:21,249
store stroke dezirae which lets us do

592
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:24,820
custom dashed borders in CSS this sets

593
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:31,899
the dash width this sets the dash gap so

594
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:35,320
you can do some pretty trippy things if

595
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,600
you increase the stroke as much as the

596
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,499
radius so that there's no circle and

597
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:45,519
just stroke oh and let's give it a

598
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,940
background because remember this points

599
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,590
to the SVG element which is just another

600
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,840
HTML element so you can give it normal

601
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,960
CSS properties like background or border

602
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,590
radius so we can do some pretty cool

603
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,559
stuff but okay let's not get distracted

604
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,869
because that's rays cool let's remember

605
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:09,340
we were trying to do pie charts

606
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,990
how do pie charts relate to this well I

607
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,340
could increase my gap a lot like

608
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,259
seriously a lot like as much as the

609
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:23,470
circumference of the circle and well I

610
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,970
could just do this by trial and error

611
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,590
I'll could just calculate what the

612
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,110
circumference is this is where these

613
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,419
weird numbers come in so my radius is

614
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:34,690
25% of what of 64 because that's my view

615
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:41,860
box so 25% of 64 and then remember

616
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,360
what's the formula for the circumference

617
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,450
of the circle two times pi times R we

618
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,429
have the R we need to multiply by 2 and

619
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,919
pi so this is our sin cumference a

620
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,139
little over a hundred and why is this

621
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:59,379
convenient because then as long as we

622
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:02,049
set the the gap width to be as much as

623
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:04,629
the circumference the dash width

624
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,340
basically corresponds to the percentage

625
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,669
we want to show in our pie so we can set

626
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,409
any percentage we want with just this

627
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:13,389
one property it corresponds to the

628
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:15,029
percentage were actually trying to show

629
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:17,049
okay I know what you're thinking it

630
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:18,549
doesn't have the right orientation let's

631
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:21,190
fix that remember we can play regular

632
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:26,909
CSS properties here so let's do - okay

633
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:32,230
and there we can show any percentage we

634
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,460
want just by adjusting this one number

635
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:43,389
can we animate hell yeah yeah I'm not

636
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:45,549
very good with names as you as you might

637
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:53,409
have noticed just foo and let's make

638
00:31:53,409 --> 00:32:02,160
this zero

639
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,780
so there's our animation just one line

640
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,630
one simple animation one line two it's

641
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:19,430
basically as simple as it gets

642
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,229
and you can have multiple segments here

643
00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:26,649
here's how I've used attributes here you

644
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:28,419
don't have to use attributes I've just

645
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:29,859
used them so I can have my whole thing

646
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:32,859
in one place SVG has these weird inline

647
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,690
Styles that are basically attributes but

648
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,129
they're different from inline Styles so

649
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:37,869
it has both it has inline Styles as well

650
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:39,820
and it has attributes attributes have

651
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,469
zero specificity so they're kind of like

652
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:43,059
the opposite of inline Styles if I apply

653
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:46,779
any CSS to this it's a the it overrides

654
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:50,319
the attributes but for all intents and

655
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,359
purposes in this case they treat Emma's

656
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:55,599
properties so you can just use - offset

657
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,849
if you want to have multiple segments

658
00:32:57,849 --> 00:32:59,829
you can just add another circle give it

659
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:01,719
an offset so that it doesn't cover the

660
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:03,429
other one and you can have as many

661
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:05,379
segments as you want this is actually a

662
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:07,479
real pie chart you can see that most of

663
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,949
the CSS working group is member

664
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:11,999
companies like browsers basically so

665
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:14,079
next time somebody tells you that

666
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,059
browsers just have to implement whatever

667
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:18,219
standards w3c Springs on them you know

668
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:23,559
you know better flexibility we can

669
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:26,109
change the colors in with one edit we

670
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,489
can say is that we can change the size

671
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:30,579
within to edit we will probably make it

672
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:33,759
with one as well if we really try one

673
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,769
edit for the value we can set the value

674
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:38,799
in line yes we do need extra elements

675
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,259
but we can just write a short JavaScript

676
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:45,549
script to add these seven declarations

677
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:47,079
only it's the shortest solution we've

678
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:50,979
seen so far it's pretty straightforward

679
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:52,719
by the way if you're wondering about

680
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:55,539
accessibility any SVG element can have a

681
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:57,429
tight little child so you can just have

682
00:33:57,429 --> 00:33:59,619
a title element inside it and all the

683
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:02,829
content you want multiple values are

684
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:04,989
possible it's easy to animate we've seen

685
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:07,299
it effects are possible don't mess it

686
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:09,159
because you have to use SVG syntax for

687
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,909
adding safe gradients or patterns and

688
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,950
it's not a great syntax but it's

689
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,529
possible

690
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:20,319
so overall the SVG stroke - array method

691
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:24,399
is pretty much beats both as which CSS

692
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,830
methods we've seen can we do better

693
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,120
so here's their night another idea how

694
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,650
many of you have heard about conic

695
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:39,370
gradients how many of you have heard

696
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,870
about Kony gradients in the context of

697
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:47,830
CSS cool nice so this is a conic

698
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:53,810
gradient

699
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,850
basically it's a ray changing color and

700
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,830
rotating around a fixed center point the

701
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,240
gradient I'm making right now has

702
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,120
nothing to do with pie charts

703
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:14,560
it's just a cool gradient it's basically

704
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,200
the hue wheel that you see on all color

705
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:30,410
Pickers

706
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,579
we would be able to do it with a conic

707
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:36,599
gradient and okay let's not get

708
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,869
distracted pie charts pie charts so how

709
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:44,220
do these help us do pie charts well we

710
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:49,700
can just have a conic gradient like this

711
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:56,510
with two stops there it is

712
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,039
remember zero is equal to thirty percent

713
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,660
but so that we can change the

714
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,670
percentages one place so yeah basically

715
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,640
it's one line of code and we can show

716
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,150
all the percentages we want just with

717
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:18,180
this one line do we

718
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,580
thank you and what if we want multiple

719
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:30,380
segments well easy-peasy there you go

720
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,930
that's not a great percentage let's do

721
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,960
something nicer yeah all right 60 yeah

722
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,910
that looks better so there you can have

723
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,920
as many segments as you want still one

724
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,270
line of code and that spec is in CSS

725
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,300
images level four and actually it has

726
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,640
many nice examples it has the pie chart

727
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,770
as an example I made sure I I added this

728
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,780
so I made sure to include that you can

729
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,970
even have repeating gradients which may

730
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,640
likely do starbursts you contribute

731
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,630
checker boards with conic gradients so

732
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,820
let's evaluate this solution flexibility

733
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,360
wise wanted to change the colors one

734
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,580
edit to change the size wanted to change

735
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,590
the value we can set it in line you can

736
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,810
just set the gradient no extra elements

737
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,390
only three declarations the other two of

738
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,060
which are border radius and padding very

739
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,900
straightforward just one line multiple

740
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,360
values are possible super easy to

741
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,250
animate just animate the colors top

742
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,590
position some effects are possible you

743
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,480
can just instead of doing the same color

744
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,130
stop just do two and then you can have a

745
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,130
small gradient okay that's sort of a bad

746
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,030
thing about it

747
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,030
the effects are difficult but still

748
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:51,870
overall it's a pretty awesome solution

749
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,240
except one little thing this is the

750
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,450
browser support

751
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,279
yeah come on come on browsers please

752
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:10,660
especially Microsoft can implement it

753
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,059
more easily than any others and actually

754
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,440
Microsoft has put it on the backlog

755
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,210
which means they are actually actively

756
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,549
interested in their planning to work on

757
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:21,549
it and you know how it works once one

758
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,279
browsers it implements it the others

759
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:27,910
follow here's you where you come in

760
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,940
actually many developers think that

761
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,730
browsers decide what to implement in a

762
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,869
vacuum and it doesn't matter what

763
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:40,210
developers want what developers want is

764
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,119
the primary motivation for prioritizing

765
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,190
what to implement sure if developers

766
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,900
want something that's super difficult to

767
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,490
implement like a parent selected like

768
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,710
the parent selector yeah that's that's

769
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,299
more difficult to get browsers to do to

770
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:55,750
do it but in general browsers have teams

771
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,589
that whose entire jobs are to monitor

772
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:02,500
what developers want every browser maybe

773
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,359
except Apple because Apple doesn't

774
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:07,660
really care but every browser has a

775
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,569
developer relations team which whose

776
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:12,190
main purpose is to connect with

777
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,900
developers see what they want bring it

778
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,519
back to the browser so where do you

779
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,970
where do you come in you can you can

780
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,160
tweet about it you can vote on

781
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,140
Microsoft's user voice which actually

782
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,369
all the browser's follow it not just

783
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:26,950
Microsoft you can vote on the bugs if

784
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,269
you have anything useful to add you

785
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,339
cannot comment on the bug reports there

786
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:31,900
are bug reports on with every major

787
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,259
browser on this your voice matters as

788
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:36,910
long as you make as long as you make

789
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,039
sure that you're heard it matters and

790
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,690
you can make browsers implement what

791
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,940
matters to you and that doesn't just

792
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,500
apply to connect gradients it applies to

793
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,450
anything it's like the closest thing we

794
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:55,150
have to direct democracy so the other

795
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,630
thing is okay like I've just said no

796
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,339
browser implements connect gradients so

797
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:04,059
what was I showing you right now I mean

798
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:05,619
have you've seen that my slides are

799
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:10,599
basically an HTML page in chrome so what

800
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,950
was I showing

801
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,250
what is this so I've actually made and

802
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,760
released a polyfill it's on this address

803
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,580
don't get hub and there's even it works

804
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,770
with prefix-free but there's also a post

805
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,970
CSS plugin we're using the same code you

806
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,100
can you don't you can play with it

807
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,920
directly on the page these are live okay

808
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,070
that's a bad choice these are live you

809
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,080
can edit them right there if you want to

810
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,240
experiment with conic gradients so after

811
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,060
spending 40 something minutes telling

812
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,520
you how to make pie charts I actually

813
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,920
pie charts a good idea how many here

814
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,630
have heard of Edward Tufte he's like the

815
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,000
information visualization master he is a

816
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,590
very big name in information

817
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,300
visualization he's written tons of books

818
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,240
he runs tons of workshops so one of the

819
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,100
things he's often quoted as saying he

820
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,100
wrote it this way in one of his books a

821
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,660
table is nearly always better than a

822
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,450
dumb pie chart the only worse design

823
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:23,110
than a pie chart is several of them for

824
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,580
then the viewer is asked to compare

825
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,680
quantities located in spite in spatial

826
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,260
disarray I will explain what this means

827
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,100
shortly both within and between pies

828
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,840
given their low data density and failure

829
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,370
to order numbers along the visual

830
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,250
dimension pie charts should never be

831
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:45,580
used okay he does have a point he's not

832
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,500
always right he's not right in every

833
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,720
case there are several exceptions but he

834
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,580
does have a point look at this pie chart

835
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,850
which slice is bigger which slice is

836
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,240
smaller can you rank can you order them

837
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,420
based on an order of which percentages

838
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,870
in an in order of size of percentage

839
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,110
they're very similar right it's hard to

840
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,600
do it with a bar chart you can instantly

841
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,010
see that they're actually the same and

842
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,790
I've been trolling you all along what

843
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,500
about this one which one's smaller which

844
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,020
one's bigger it's kind of hard to tell

845
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,170
with a bar chart you can we can do it

846
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:27,790
instantly well yes this applies when you

847
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,190
have a pie chart of multiple percentages

848
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,560
very close to each other when you want

849
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,540
to show a trend pie charts are great

850
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,280
when you only want to show two

851
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,980
percentages maybe three and they're not

852
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,990
that close together but you want to show

853
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,030
a trend pie charts can be a good idea

854
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:46,060
and in some cases pie charts shine if

855
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,860
you want to show whether it's if the

856
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,300
important bit is whether something is

857
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,600
lower or higher than 50% this is much

858
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,490
easier to show with a pie chart than it

859
00:42:54,490 --> 00:43:07,330
is with a bar chart however does it

860
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,820
really matter this top was never really

861
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,360
about pie charts right thank you very
