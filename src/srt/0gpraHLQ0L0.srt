00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,600

great all right good morning so what

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,180
makes something revolutionary for

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,699
purposes of this talk I'm gonna propose

4
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,359
the following definition something is

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,059
revolutionary when it not only totally

6
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,420
disrupts the established order but it

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,510
replaces the established order with a

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,989
new order and thus it changes the

9
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,030
dynamics of everything around it the

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,370
discipline of front-end development is

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,100
continuing to change at a meteoric rate

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,539
and in hindsight this isn't actually a

13
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,690
big surprise for ours is the discipline

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,339
that deals with the user people and how

15
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,790
they interact in their emotions and so

16
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,830
of course we're going to need more of us

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,280
as more and more people continue to get

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,680
on the internet and as our devices have

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:25,799
taken over and things are chaotic every

20
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,650
day we have a new tool new frameworks

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,590
sometimes it's absolutely exhausting to

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,820
keep up and in fact all of these new

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,600
tools are transforming our lives as

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,409
developers and designers they're giving

25
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,930
us these new capabilities that we can

26
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,040
turn into new opportunities and this is

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,360
actually what's important over the last

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,219
few years we've had to adopt to many

29
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,149
many many many many new changes and it's

30
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,270
these behavioral changes that we make to

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,600
keep up with our craft that's actually

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,890
revolutionary and that's because

33
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,840
revolutions don't happen when we adopt

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,940
new technologies

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,580
they actually happen when we adopt new

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,380
behaviors so what are these behaviors

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,330
that we've actually adopted right and

38
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,370
how do we go about understanding what a

39
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,130
behavior is so before we get into that

40
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,220
we're going to look at the doctor frog's

41
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,200
behavior method which is a model for

42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,190
persuasive technology for developing

43
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,950
persuasive technology and dr. Fogg leads

44
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,110
the persuasive tech lab at Stanford

45
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,450
University and in the 90s his big thing

46
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,730
was that he published a paper that said

47
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,160
you know what computers might actually

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,700
be able to alter and change what we do

49
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,130
and I was kind of mind-blowing for

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,760
people so what is his model his model

51
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
states that behavior is actually

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,030
composed of three factors its motivation

53
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,060
ability and a trigger and all three of

54
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,610
these things need to be present in order

55
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,410
for us to do anything so first we need

56
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,250
to be sufficiently motivated and

57
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,750
motivation is really anything that gets

58
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,410
you to act for some you might be

59
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,570
motivated by money for others they might

60
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,660
be motivated by freedom and so given

61
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,989
that motivation is so subjective it's

62
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,239
actually not a good thing to rely just

63
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,070
on motivation to change someone's

64
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:44,220
behavior second is ability and the

65
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,450
ability is a bit of a difficult one to

66
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,370
explain it really has to deal with how

67
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,590
simple or easy something is and that

68
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,440
varies individually for a person for

69
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,330
example if a task at hand is going to

70
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,000
take ten minutes and you don't have ten

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,250
minutes then you aren't able to perform

72
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,890
that task even if that task is

73
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,090
relatively easy for you it isn't so

74
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,870
persuasive technologies really focus on

75
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,640
lowering ability lowering that barrier

76
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,380
to entry no matter what so that it's

77
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,580
easy for anyone to get into it unless

78
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,360
Lea triggers

79
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,810
which can be squirrels for some people

80
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,120
depending who you are they can take many

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,030
forms so a trigger can be anything such

82
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,590
as like an alarm or a notification a an

83
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,509
article that you've read that's

84
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,000
prompting you to do something and there

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,979
are three characteristics two triggers

86
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:46,099
that make them successful first we

87
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:49,699
actually have to notice them second we

88
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:52,009
have to associate this trigger with a

89
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,699
target behavior and third when it

90
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:57,740
actually happens we have to be

91
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,050
sufficiently motivated to perform the

92
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,139
behavior so it looks like this on a

93
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,349
graph basically if this line is behavior

94
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,780
anything that happens here will result

95
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,449
in a successful behavior and anything

96
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,789
that occurs in here will result in an in

97
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,300
successful behavior so you can see that

98
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,490
the easier something is to do with lower

99
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,650
motivation now you're gonna capped it

100
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,490
cap get more people but the harder it

101
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,810
gets some more motivation you also need

102
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,840
to require make sure that it's easy to

103
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,009
do if something requires a high level of

104
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:42,740
motivation and it's hard to do very few

105
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,599
people are actually going to be able to

106
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:47,599
do it so you keep this in mind when we

107
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:50,229
start to take a look at how our tools

108
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:54,379
use this persuasive technology model to

109
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:56,629
get us to use them and adopt their

110
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:04,639
behaviors so now we need to back up a

111
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,969
little bit to the mid arts to take a

112
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:11,990
look at how behavior how our tools

113
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,779
utilize this model to to affect our

114
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,569
behavior and because we're talking about

115
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,879
front-end we don't actually have to go

116
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,789
all the way back in time about 2005 is

117
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,210
2007 and there was a lot of sort of

118
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,770
rumblings happen in web development

119
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,770
we're coming out of the web standards

120
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,039
movement in 2000 javascript and CSS at

121
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,589
this point in time are really poised for

122
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:37,730
some change

123
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,380
it's kind of difficult to navigate the

124
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,450
web so there was a bunch of new

125
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,390
JavaScript frameworks and they were all

126
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,040
aimed at addressing the API

127
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,320
inconsistencies that we were

128
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,060
experiencing as web developers and in

129
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,470
2006 john resonating released jQuery and

130
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,490
it wasn't the first framework that came

131
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,240
out we can see that they were actually a

132
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,870
bunch of them but jQuery did three

133
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,260
things that none of these other tools

134
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:21,230
managed to do in time first had a really

135
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,690
really simple solution to Dom

136
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:29,930
manipulation second it released with

137
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,810
really good documentation there were

138
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,610
libraries that came out before for

139
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,710
example of the prototype library that

140
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,660
was adopted in rails it didn't have

141
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,700
documentation for the first year or so

142
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,980
that makes it really hard for anyone to

143
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,880
jump in and figure out what to do and

144
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,390
lastly when jQuery launched it launched

145
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,030
with an invitation for people to

146
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,620
participate and to contribute and by the

147
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,820
second day someone had already released

148
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,440
the first plug-in and this was amazing

149
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,350
this was the first time that you could

150
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,920
do this and John's response is to say

151
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,900
you know what I'm gonna make this a

152
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,630
really big thing I'm gonna ensure that

153
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,570
we have a place for anyone to contribute

154
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,580
their code and that it's easy for them

155
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,920
to do it because he realized the value

156
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,080
of what was going on so J's jQuery

157
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,599
success is the fact that it took a very

158
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,660
simple approach which allowed anyone to

159
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,599
join even if you had sufficient

160
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,430
motivation and at that time period we

161
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,830
can say that our motivation was

162
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,500
incredibly high it was a nightmare to be

163
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,779
working on the web

164
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:54,750
secondly good documentation making

165
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,779
making it easy the ability lowering the

166
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,870
ability and this invitation to

167
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,800
participate

168
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,980
perhaps a trigger and perhaps the other

169
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,600
triggers were just the articles that

170
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,740
were coming out now it's still the

171
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,020
number one open source framework in use

172
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,440
and there's been a lot of grumbling

173
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,600
whether or not we should continue using

174
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,790
jQuery I'm not going to go into that in

175
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,560
this confidence thing in this talk I

176
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,830
leave that up to you to decide but the

177
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,930
really important thing is that these

178
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,089
three design decisions paved the way for

179
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,550
big revolution in front-end development

180
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,399
and it led to other projects like node

181
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,760
and react and all the amazing things

182
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,440
that are coming out in JavaScript now

183
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,839
which is why we have these week-long

184
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:55,810
conferences all over the world so

185
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,070
contribution has always been a major

186
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,520
part of back-end development it's kind

187
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,399
of a big tenant of the web right but its

188
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,920
foray into front-end development is very

189
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,579
very recent and in CSS since sort of the

190
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:16,829
UX world this is even more recent so

191
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,170
around the same time that jQuery is kind

192
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,720
of picking up speed CSS on the other

193
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,959
hand is really ready for its Renaissance

194
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,640
let's take a look at where we were about

195
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,200
mid odds somehow we had decided that 960

196
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,020
pixels was the best way to design our

197
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,060
websites and the only way to design our

198
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:44,970
websites we also had ie6 7 8 9 who knows

199
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,180
how many other browsers and we were

200
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,490
finally really excited for this thing

201
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,880
called css3 that was going to help rid

202
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,920
our HTML of a bunch of tag soup but what

203
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,800
did that introduce a bunch of vendor

204
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,329
prefixes because all the browser's

205
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,140
couldn't decide how

206
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,510
they wanted to adopt it and who had to

207
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,730
deal with that pain we did right so it's

208
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,390
not surprising that we wanted new things

209
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,360
and additionally here comes the

210
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,630
smartphone completely about to change

211
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,850
every notion that we have a best

212
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,070
practice and we start developing these

213
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,570
new techniques for dealing with things

214
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,900
like smacks and object-oriented CSS and

215
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,720
BEM and conventions that are trying to

216
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,360
save our life and so it's really no

217
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,980
surprise that preprocessors arrived and

218
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,130
much like jQuery and JavaScript there

219
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,380
were a ton I didn't know about these but

220
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,580
I CSS P P DT CSS a bunch of free

221
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,280
processors because our need was was

222
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:02,160
evident but there were two that really

223
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,490
edged out and how did that happen

224
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,720
the reason is by the same design

225
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,630
decisions so SAS was always kind of

226
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,350
touted as one of the more powerful ones

227
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,180
but it had a really big contender less

228
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,620
and less adoption and Jake in excuse me

229
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,750
in boot shop is one of the reasons that

230
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,200
I think it continued and once SAS picked

231
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,860
up the CSS syntax it made it much easier

232
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,860
for anyone to come in and to collaborate

233
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,260
so we can see that we had the motivation

234
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,030
but SAS was a little more difficult to

235
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:57,150
use but it did edge out and last year it

236
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,050
won the game changer award and recently

237
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,300
there was an article published that said

238
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,040
that a 66% a front end people are using

239
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,820
SAS today which is huge but it took some

240
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,650
other things

241
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,510
well SAS

242
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,670
was sort of answering our problems for

243
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,460
dealing with vendor prefixes and making

244
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,000
it easier to write CSS I feel that it

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,210
wasn't until compass came along and

246
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,260
provided a way for authoring writers

247
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,440
ourselves to contribute and it was a

248
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,550
little complicated

249
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,100
we grumbled at first we had to learn

250
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,840
Ruby and how to make ruby gems but it

251
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,770
ultimately paid off and now it's even

252
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,590
easier to contribute this things like

253
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,070
libsass where you don't even have to

254
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,840
worry about packaging up and creating

255
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,690
ruby gems anymore as long as you build

256
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,620
an extensible framework your sass file

257
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,180
can be included and used anywhere and

258
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,200
it's amazing right we now have an

259
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,620
amazing amount of tools people are

260
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,020
creating new things every day we're

261
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:23,410
experimenting and this was this is new

262
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,870
we couldn't do this before we were

263
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,070
writing blog posts and trying to share

264
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,470
tips and tricks but we couldn't share

265
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,100
our code and aside from joining the

266
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,220
working group there was no way to really

267
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:46,070
affect change in the language and what's

268
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,180
even more incredible is how these tools

269
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,640
are now influencing the parent language

270
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,340
and there's a bunch of amazing new

271
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,460
things coming out in CSS level 4

272
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,000
we've got variables in CSS where did

273
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,750
that come from

274
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,480
that came from sass that came from

275
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,080
pre-processors we have mix-ins

276
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,560
we have grids we have blend modes there

277
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,770
are so many amazing things and yes I

278
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,990
don't necessarily have full insight into

279
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,870
the working group so I'm sure that they

280
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,130
are developing ideas on their own but

281
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,360
I'm also positive that they're looking

282
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,430
at the changes in the community to make

283
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,440
those decisions you can also see that

284
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,270
with

285
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,370
recent release of epimer script six and

286
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,640
how it took a lot of its new features

287
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,240
from CoffeeScript why did CoffeeScript

288
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,830
come out because we were tired of

289
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,260
writing a lot of j/s and there was a lot

290
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,540
of inconsistencies that CoffeeScript

291
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,670
nicely packaged away for us so we could

292
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:54,460
do things the right way and this is

293
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,410
incredible our tools are lowering the

294
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:06,700
threshold for finding new ideas and by

295
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,310
doing this they've opened up tremendous

296
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,150
opportunity for finding for for new

297
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,810
things we're free to experiment we can

298
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,790
get out there we don't have to rely on

299
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,370
these larger institutions and this is

300
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,920
very new this is this participatory

301
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,700
innovation that we're talking about our

302
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,070
tools have created a participatory

303
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,000
culture and our traditional rules don't

304
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,310
really matter anymore because we can

305
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,760
move ahead of them and this is

306
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,870
incredibly important because it's the

307
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,170
ability for collective participation and

308
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,260
collective action that are really the

309
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,130
necessary ingredients for change our

310
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,860
tools have enabled us to try radical

311
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,800
things we're creating environments in

312
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,550
which people can get things done and

313
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,770
we're doing this while being encouraging

314
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,470
and supportive and welcoming so it was

315
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,959
really fascinating for me is when you

316
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,750
start to look at the growth of our tools

317
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,390
in the adoption and you can do this in

318
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,750
Google Trends we get this really

319
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,120
interesting distribution which tends to

320
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,570
look like a power log and in network

321
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,800
science this type of graph of behavior

322
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,010
represents a small world network and

323
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,480
small world networks our networks that

324
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,290
are built up of many nodes that are

325
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,010
connected to each other and they have to

326
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,660
incredibly evolutionary advance

327
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,910
advantages the first is that they're

328
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,390
resistant to damage and the second is

329
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,630
that they disseminate information really

330
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,450
well they act both as filters and

331
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:07,030
amplifiers so what's incredible is that

332
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,390
perhaps without us even really noticing

333
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,020
it we've designed our front-end

334
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,980
communities for growth and resilience

335
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,050
and so given that we are so skilled at

336
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,980
creating such a resilient Network one

337
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,580
that values the uniqueness of its

338
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,960
members and the people within it and

339
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,580
given that we can do so in such a short

340
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,510
amount of time

341
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,980
oonh really is a decade ten years I

342
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,840
really believe that we have a lot to

343
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,570
contribute back to society

344
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,480
beyond just great websites and

345
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,680
experiences citizens the world over are

346
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,750
already calling for change and I believe

347
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,840
along with many others that in order for

348
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,780
this change to happen it's only going to

349
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,440
come through a participatory revolution

350
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,160
and I also predict that we're gonna see

351
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,560
a very big change from solving technical

352
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,850
problems to more interpersonal problems

353
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,260
about the people and who better to take

354
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,480
part in this than us we are successful

355
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,720
practicing models of participatory

356
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,190
culture it's not we may take this for

357
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,540
granted but it's really incredible not

358
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,630
everyone works this way not everyone has

359
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,470
the ability to work this way and so

360
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,300
maybe we can put the same design

361
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,720
decisions that we've put into our tools

362
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,220
into making cities better into improving

363
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,190
education systems

364
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,090
code literacy holds immense power it's

365
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,409
more than just a job or a career change

366
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,570
it's this ability to participate in the

367
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,889
largest human connected network that's

368
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:21,899
what the web is it has a culture it has

369
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:25,710
a history it has a social structure and

370
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,090
it's shaped by each of us so it's really

371
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,419
up to us to decide where we want to

372
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,359
create these opportunities and what we

373
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,559
want to do with them and it'll vary by

374
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,179
what we can do it can be as large as

375
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:46,889
organizing this conference and bring us

376
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:50,970
together to talk and share it can be as

377
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,820
small as taking the time to mentor

378
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,749
someone and help them write a blog post

379
00:20:56,749 --> 00:21:00,659
release the plug-in it doesn't matter

380
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,190
what it is what matters most right now

381
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,960
is that we keep creating because this is

382
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,309
what's going to determine what comes

383
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:20,039
next and there's less harm in that so

384
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:24,629
please make up and while we do it

385
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:27,509
just remember to continue to be

386
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:33,359
inclusive and welcoming because if we do

387
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,809
this if we will continue to innovate and

388
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:42,359
given what we've just observed I really

389
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:44,759
believe that our innovations will

390
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,279
continue to be revolutionary thank you
