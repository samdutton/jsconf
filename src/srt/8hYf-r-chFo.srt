[Applause]

11
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,189
okay all right

12
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:32,020
so yeah I'm soccerberry this talk is

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,460
about kerning and video sin or

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,620
synthesizer with JavaScript and of

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,320
course the browser a little bit about me

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,370
at thanks for the introduction

17
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,010
yeah work at UCF and obviously I love

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,720
javascript in the browser which is why

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,130
I'm here

20
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,660
yeah it's the minimum proposal on the

21
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,250
last day kind of like a what the heck

22
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,200
why not really didn't think I'd be

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,530
picked and yet here I am so that's why

24
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,870
this was the official photo that I gave

25
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,190
the conference this was my family I was

26
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,750
visiting back home in Panama City Beach

27
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,420
and my parents were like hey come down

28
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,659
to the beach and this was the result and

29
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,659
her promises wasn't intentional but that

30
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:20,020
is indeed a J has come 15 shirt yeah so

31
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,060
I'm super thrilled to be able to visit

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,159
the conference in Amelia Island and now

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,080
to be able to present so that's super

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,850
cool and a promise it was not

35
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,700
intentional okay so the inspiration for

36
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,150
this idea we're gonna start off with a

37
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,619
little experiment this is some code that

38
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,810
I'm gonna try to run through real quick

39
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,909
and I'll show you what it does it's

40
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:42,369
going to take the whole body element and

41
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,070
it's going to shove it into Marky which

42
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,630
I know if you knew this but Marky does

43
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,520
have options so you can speed it up and

44
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,189
reverse it we're also going to select

45
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:54,070
all the spans and H ones and so so have

46
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,900
you and then on each of those want to

47
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,200
put those in a marquee

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,590
because we can and then we're gonna make

49
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,180
an angle variable and then send an

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,409
interval and then we're just gonna

51
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,280
increment that for every dip on the page

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,440
and we're gonna do that every

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:19,590
millisecond so let's see we have Jes

54
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,500
comp let's run this and see what happens

55
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,209
so it'll come back around

56
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:32,819
yeah and it's a little bit fast but you

57
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,319
can still use it if I was able to click

58
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,090
on a button it would still work I tried

59
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,370
it I'm not gonna try here cuz it's hard

60
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,090
but enough of that so what was the point

61
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,239
of that right so browser is a powerful

62
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,739
rendering engine I'm kind of surprising

63
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,390
and put uh Martina Marquis in a monkey

64
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,830
and you can rotate the whole page in it

65
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,430
for the most part handles it and the

66
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:06,390
marquee tag still works backwards

67
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,950
compatibility is awesome

68
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,769
so that's that's I'm kind of trying to

69
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,299
lay out like kind of the concept of the

70
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:14,160
idea that's one little piece of my brain

71
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,410
the other piece is something that I've

72
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,940
been kind of excited about which is

73
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,220
modular synthesis I'm kind of excited -

74
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,440
yesterday on the Erb not yesterday but

75
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,970
the first day I talked someone did have

76
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,620
a photo of like a modular set up which

77
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,579
was really cool but I will let Andrew

78
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,650
Huang a famous youtuber explain because

79
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,750
he can explain it better than I can so

80
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,290
let's see if this works

81
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:51,000
maybe let's see if I can turn this up

82
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,030
okay well no but I'll try to explain it

83
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,860
then so each of these pieces is a little

84
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,430
module and you can plug them together so

85
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,680
some of them create audio so it's just

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,440
like a simple sine or square waveform

87
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,820
others can then manipulate and manage

88
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,920
that audio and and transform it in

89
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:42,770
different ways so thank you this

90
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,580
crowd-sourced okay so output should be

91
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,400
headphones okay all right thank you all

92
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,000
right all right so how this relates to

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,310
JavaScript so module sentence this is

94
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,230
composed of several modules and those

95
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,200
take input and give output that's kind

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,340
of it's a little bit of a stretch but

97
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,330
that's kind of like how functional

98
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,830
programs are made you kind of combine

99
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,140
and composed several functions they take

100
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,190
input and give output third piece of my

101
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,980
brain is I started producing music

102
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,590
electronic music and I needed something

103
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,690
to put into the SoundCloud little

104
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,880
thumbnail thing for album art so I

105
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,340
generated I wrote this application that

106
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,040
generates SVG's dynamically and so if I

107
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,270
clicked on one of these it would

108
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,500
download a two thousand four two

109
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,080
thousand PNG and I can reload just to

110
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,669
show you it's it's live so that was

111
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,590
really cool I was pretty happy with that

112
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,060
but the code is terrible and when I I

113
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,710
would have to go through and edit the

114
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,270
code and like make changes so like maybe

115
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,740
I didn't like this one color I wanted

116
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,090
there to be more circles and more lines

117
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,070
and that was kind of a tedious process

118
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,960
and I thought it would be really cool if

119
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,820
I could tweak these parameters live

120
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,480
with some sort of user interface and

121
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,460
then I showed you modular synthesis we

122
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,970
subtract to explain it audio is another

123
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,980
signal and so is video so you can do the

124
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,320
same type of thing with video as well so

125
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,170
this is the this is a video modular

126
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,600
synth and it can like take the red

127
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
channel then you can manipulate that and

128
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,280
transform video in different ways

129
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,630
hopefully this works but this is a

130
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,060
friend of mine who has a huge video

131
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,310
modular set up this is a little demo of

132
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,690
him kind of tweaking some parameters

133
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:34,050
live so he's changing the effect of the

134
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:45,780
video here and so it's actually not that

135
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,920
new

136
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,930
the first visualizer as far as I

137
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,320
understand it was back in 1977 with the

138
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,630
Atari video music and that is the same

139
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,460
Atari they're thinking of for like the

140
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,450
2600 and to my knowledge the first time

141
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,490
it was used was in the background of a

142
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,290
Devo video so I figured I'd show it to

143
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:21,549
you

144
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:26,099
so basically the Atari video music works

145
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,990
by it takes audio signals and then it

146
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,819
kind of it's it's a little black box but

147
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,490
it it makes these diamond patterns and

148
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,199
weird squiggly and this was a good

149
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,729
example because some of the stuff can be

150
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,210
super flashy I didn't want to show that

151
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,379
but there are a few parameters you can

152
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,729
tweak to them modify how that works so

153
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,930
all this stuff is really cool I love a

154
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,449
lot and it's very kind of this VHS low

155
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,089
fine 90s 80s kind of thing but I also

156
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:55,050
like very digital type of aesthetics so

157
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,909
here's two examples of some of that

158
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:12,160
hopefully

159
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:24,870
that's one and then here's the other so

160
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,910
as you can see that's kind of reacting

161
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,590
to the audio it's very purposely built

162
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,210
to do that but that got me thinking it'd

163
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,590
be really cool to be able to create

164
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,450
these videos live as I was performing

165
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,300
music and they're simple to the point

166
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,669
that at least graphically wise they're

167
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,840
simple so that I could totally make

168
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,790
these with like a canvas or SVG

169
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,510
application and then going with that

170
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,910
it's crazy how much again with the power

171
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,940
of the browser we have CSS animations 2d

172
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,770
3d graphics you have SVG we have video

173
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,770
we have awesome libraries like 3GS pics

174
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,360
ejs and this is obviously just - and a

175
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,700
huge multitude of libraries and we have

176
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,140
all these api's and some of the talks

177
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,240
that you've seen here talk about some of

178
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,300
these cool api's so why don't we harness

179
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,800
this technology and so that's the idea

180
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,830
so let's see oh right this is this is

181
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,720
not my app yet this is another site okay

182
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,090
so and then the idea here is that we

183
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,140
have all this types of hardware and all

184
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,270
this Hardware sends different signals so

185
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,780
here I have a ps4 a gamepad you can see

186
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,770
that and the mouse audio this is like

187
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,590
reading the audio level from the MacBook

188
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:46,590
and then those are many messages so

189
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,300
would it be cool if we could then

190
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,060
harness all of those kind of as a signal

191
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,160
kind of like drawing inspiration from

192
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,880
the video modular synth and each of

193
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,110
these can be harnessed through different

194
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,030
api's so gamepad is gamepad API

195
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,640
obviously media capture and streams here

196
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,110
is just for audio but you can also do

197
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,160
video which I'll show you in a little

198
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,550
bit

199
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,960
and then those can send signals over to

200
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,340
some sort of application that

201
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,530
application can harness those libraries

202
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,260
and those web api s but what we could

203
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,960
also do is that we could at least the

204
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,180
idea is to remap those live so we could

205
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,730
change the configuration and then change

206
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,630
the visualization as a result

207
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,760
so let's get into that so this is

208
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,840
probably built it's an application

209
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,230
called bit kid let me see if I can make

210
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,320
it bigger the idea is that we have kind

211
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,080
of a software version of a visual sense

212
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,510
so here we have the mouse node that's

213
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,280
reading the Dom events from the mouse

214
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,380
and then as I move back and forth it's

215
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,290
changing these x and y-values and those

216
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,230
are being put into the inner to the

217
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,120
display up there which i am calling the

218
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,150
screen so if I full screen here you can

219
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,310
see it's simple it's just showing you

220
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,760
the the pixel values but what I can do

221
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:12,050
is an example is let's see look actually

222
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,580
there's a good example so all of those

223
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,190
nodes are just JavaScript and they're

224
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,870
kind of inspired by web components they

225
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,100
actually are web components but these

226
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,160
are own life cycle methods so anything

227
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,080
that you see in the node can be changed

228
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,140
up here is the inputs so those can be

229
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,480
defined with like what kind of a value

230
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,400
they accept as well as other options so

231
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,310
let me put these together and what I'm

232
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,900
gonna do is I'm gonna hook up the

233
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,490
x-value of the mouse to rotate our

234
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,370
screen so with that little change I'm

235
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,810
able to now the mouse is kind of

236
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,750
controlling the rotate the CSS rotation

237
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,670
of this element here so just a quick

238
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,580
overview of how it works this is what I

239
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,890
said this is the screen element these

240
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,130
are what I call nodes each node has

241
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,530
optionally a list of inputs and listed

242
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,080
outputs there's also the web component

243
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,810
that I spoke about and then each of the

244
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,450
inputs optionally has a UI that kind of

245
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,280
lets you set the values if you don't set

246
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,360
them through some sort of hardware

247
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,250
method and then those can be connected

248
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,460
and how it works is each of those like I

249
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,410
showed you that code that's the node J

250
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,420
is not I don't mean the framework node

251
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,890
but I mean like the JavaScript that

252
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,830
makes up each node and then those gate

253
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,870
eval into

254
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,630
basically a web component class and then

255
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,210
I have a CSS and HTML which then gets

256
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,580
put into a shadow root and then that

257
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,130
those combined into my custom web

258
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,590
component that I built for this and then

259
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,320
we have a react layer which then that

260
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,880
was what the graphical interface of

261
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,470
connecting all of the nodes but also

262
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,660
each react component has a native web

263
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,640
component in it which is kind of a

264
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,050
nightmare

265
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,260
and then we have the state which this is

266
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,090
very simple but a simplified view but

267
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,470
it's basically what note is connected to

268
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,790
what node and what are the values that

269
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,430
every any given point in time and then

270
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,140
we have the screen element at the upper

271
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,870
right and that's just a web page has

272
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,600
HTML and CSS and that gets shoved into

273
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,010
an iframe so I wanted to talk a little

274
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,330
bit about some of the technology behind

275
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,880
it web components I'm sure a lot of you

276
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,190
have seen it but in case you haven't you

277
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,110
can make any sort of classics and HTML

278
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,300
element or other HTML elements if you'd

279
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,580
like like the paragraph tag and you get

280
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,320
these life cycle events so you get

281
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,850
connected callback that's when it gets

282
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,550
attached to the Dom disconnected I want

283
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,020
to get removed when it gets removed from

284
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,570
the Dom adopted means has moved to

285
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,700
another document but the one that I'm

286
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,080
really harnessing here is observed

287
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,210
tributes so what you can do is you can

288
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,150
define different attributes on the HTML

289
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,830
element and then you get a callback that

290
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,650
gets fired whenever those attributes

291
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,150
change and there's real quickly how you

292
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,530
would use it you might make like for

293
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,190
example a user icon web element you

294
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,260
define it using custom elements defined

295
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,240
I should say this only works I believe

296
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,950
in Chrome and I think it's coming to

297
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,130
Firefox soon there's some polyfills but

298
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,230
you say I whenever I see a user - icon

299
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,360
tag I want you to use that user icon

300
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,600
class and then you can make your custom

301
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,690
element all the code examples I'm going

302
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,250
to be showing you can get to with this

303
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,230
bitly URL I just have a code pen

304
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,660
collection of a bunch of kind of the

305
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,720
basics of what I'm showing you if you're

306
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,850
curious

307
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,190
so writing to the iframe is actually

308
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,570
surprisingly easy and one of the

309
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,450
examples I have code pen ink

310
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,910
pen because all you need to do is you

311
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,780
can get the the an iframe element you

312
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,850
can open it document I'll open you can

313
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,490
shove a bunch of HTML in there you can

314
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,620
then create a new style element and then

315
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,390
you can just put that into the head of

316
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,150
the iframe that you just created so it's

317
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,500
kind of hacky but what's great about

318
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,450
this is now you stand box it so if you

319
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,790
tend to if you write some weird HTML I

320
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,320
don't have to worry about it throwing

321
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,300
errors the iframe was just coner sort of

322
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,120
deal with it

323
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,970
so I heard somebody laugh with eval this

324
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,440
is a famous kind of thing from Douglas

325
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,240
Crockford where he said evil is evil and

326
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,880
basically you should never use it but I

327
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,080
wanted to make kind of a little

328
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,330
amendment except one it's using a weird

329
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:35,950
art project then you're good at least

330
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,740
you have my permission you can blame me

331
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,250
in fact it's a little punk rock because

332
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,660
it's kind of impressive that you can do

333
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,490
this with the language so here's how to

334
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,440
be evil eval

335
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,120
maybe you've avoided it for so long you

336
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,040
actually don't know how it works

337
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,040
you can give it a string of text and

338
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,050
then that will be parsed as JavaScript

339
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,330
runtime and then you'll get back if it

340
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,920
for example here I'm returning or

341
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,230
setting the value of x I can then get

342
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,740
that value back out and then how to be a

343
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,260
little bit less evil is you can use a

344
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,640
new function which is actually what I am

345
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,580
using but what's really cool is you can

346
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,310
pass attributes as strings to function

347
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,620
and then the last attribute can be code

348
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,240
and then when you actually keep that

349
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,550
function here returns the expect the

350
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,950
result that adds these numbers so I'm

351
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,210
not saying that you should probably go

352
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,000
out with your like Equifax J s like

353
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,280
server-side application and start

354
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,420
emailing everything because it's

355
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,520
incredibly inefficient but for what I

356
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,210
needed to do it was perfect okay so the

357
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,500
real point of what I was trying to do is

358
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,330
I was trying to combine CSS transitions

359
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,390
and drum machines so I will show that

360
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,770
here I have a webcam over like a switch

361
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,690
there's my face

362
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,920
on seconds this was kind of a way to

363
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,310
talk because just jammed all the

364
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,400
technology I could find into a talk and

365
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,810
hoped it would go well refresh this page

366
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,050
okay unfortunately no well trust me that

367
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,020
I have have a drum machine up here it's

368
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:20,709
the roland tr-808 the

369
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,040
these circles will just change their

370
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,740
setting to a random size and position

371
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,470
and to get back to what i was talking

372
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,240
about with the screen this is that

373
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,550
screen this is just fine H you know this

374
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,950
is what I shove into the eye frame and

375
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,080
then the the thing that makes it work is

376
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,250
just this transition here it's just 200

377
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,190
millisecond animation so I could change

378
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,770
that if I wanted to but but it's not

379
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,970
just about clicking the button it's

380
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,890
about connecting the hardware so what I

381
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,090
can do is I have a note here that takes

382
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,280
the MIDI messages from here and splits

383
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,990
it out into different channels so I know

384
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,820
you can't see this but it slipped

385
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,180
between bass drum snare drum and all the

386
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,100
different sounds so what I will do is I

387
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,590
will hook up the bass drum to this guy

388
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,000
and each of these nodes I'm connecting

389
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,220
it to those are just I'll show you those

390
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,550
just oh wait sorry that's just to show

391
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,480
you those all connect to this circle guy

392
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,420
and the circle simply just sets the

393
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,330
attribute of the ID or the element

394
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:36,680
that's the XY and the scale of them

395
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,480
oh sorry

396
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:53,110
connecting everything all right

397
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:06,600
so you show you whatever reason the pink

398
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,360
one doesn't want to cooperate but so

399
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,610
want to hit these buttons it's just

400
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:17,910
changing that all over maps so that's

401
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,880
the idea

402
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,740
thank you

403
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,340
[Applause]

404
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,730
okay so this is just another example

405
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,590
this is just a static set of SPG's but

406
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,600
they have two different states so when

407
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:48,000
they listen to this and then I can add

408
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:59,590
yeah thank you and again if I especially

409
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,500
that it literally it's just SPG's baked

410
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,240
and straight from illustrator I didn't

411
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,830
indent it you know who cares it's an art

412
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:13,270
project that's fine okay so many there

413
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,370
were some talks already about many the

414
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,410
on the first day there was talks about

415
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,080
Bimini which is a supercool project it's

416
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,490
kind of confusing because there's MIDI

417
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,320
as many files those are kind of like

418
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,020
plays sound what I'm talking about here

419
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,420
is MIDI signals so pretend that you are

420
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,100
an electronic music composer and it's

421
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,050
1981 and you have a keyboard a sin and

422
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,760
it plays all some sounds and it's really

423
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,190
cool but then you like okay I need to

424
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,020
enhance my sound so I want some drums to

425
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,210
go with this you get a 1981 drum machine

426
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,780
and it sounds awesome then you get

427
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,220
something else because you're addicted

428
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,700
and you buy too much stuff the problem

429
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,510
is that they all speak their own

430
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,960
language so when you want them to talk

431
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,150
together they can't and then in 1982 the

432
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,520
MIDI standard comes about to solve this

433
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
problem and now everything can play

434
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,530
together I realized I think I have flux

435
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:16,290
on that's why things look orange okay

436
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,660
okay so how that works is you have your

437
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,190
keyboard right and you play a note and

438
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,350
it makes a sound but if it's MIDI

439
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,330
enabled that also sends out a message so

440
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,680
it's going to say hey you've played

441
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,800
middle C and then you play a lower note

442
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,810
and hey you've played F and I don't want

443
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,180
to go super in-depth into it but the

444
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,340
message is it's just data

445
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,560
it describes like you press note on

446
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,690
that's the type Channel there can be 16

447
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,640
channels how hard you pressed it and

448
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,060
that's just binary and there's tons of

449
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,350
different messages I don't want to cover

450
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,410
them all but like knobs and clock and

451
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,000
tempo and that thing that's all there

452
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,250
but what's great is that you can connect

453
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,350
to that see web MIDI and what that looks

454
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,970
like is you request many acts

455
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,510
then you get the mini access and then

456
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,150
for each of the inputs you can just

457
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,360
listen for a mini message and then you

458
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,220
get back event that data is just a

459
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,049
special array that has the three bytes

460
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:15,130
that I showed you on the previous slide

461
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,980
and that's it it's super low level it's

462
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,309
great oh I forgot I forgot to show you

463
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:25,630
the gamepad demo actually maybe you do

464
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:33,820
that okay okay and so here I have the

465
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:40,610
gamepad mapped I saw it for a second

466
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,659
there we go okay so I have this gamepad

467
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:44,919
here this is just a PlayStation 4

468
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,630
controller and I have the axis here to

469
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,590
find to then set the background probably

470
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,669
isn't important to show you that but I

471
00:22:51,669 --> 00:23:01,450
did I remember this part all right yeah

472
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,460
so how that works is you can just listen

473
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,370
for gamepad connected you can get the

474
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,840
index because there's basically I think

475
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,010
at least on Chrome there's kind of four

476
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,340
slots of those game pads go go into and

477
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,370
then you can requestanimationframe you

478
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,070
basically are gonna pull for the values

479
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,309
that's that so here you can get the game

480
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:24,340
as you do that each time and then you

481
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,490
can log out the values of that the axes

482
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,260
or the buttons just a number from

483
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,630
negative one to one and then you just

484
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,380
keep pulling it so it's super easy

485
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:42,309
next is video in canvas I've never had

486
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:44,669
that happen before

487
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:48,280
let me try connecting this to another

488
00:23:48,280 --> 00:24:04,409
USB port and maybe that was

489
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:08,779
that seems promising sweet okay all

490
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:12,740
right so I'll show you this what this is

491
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,970
is this is just reading my webcam but

492
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,100
there's a layer on top that is you say

493
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,840
it's putting it to canvas and then on

494
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,270
canvas it's reading the pixel values and

495
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,100
then just summing up the color of that

496
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,529
pixel just because why not it looks cool

497
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:35,480
so hello Jay has come can't make you

498
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,809
guys out so yeah that's what this looks

499
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:42,289
like to show you the code behind that to

500
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,720
grab the webcam is also pretty easy

501
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,840
you ask for user media you ask for video

502
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,630
you get a stream back you can dump that

503
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,669
into a video element and just tell it to

504
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:54,770
play and it works and then of course

505
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,120
error callback which you saw right demo

506
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,669
canvas is easy as well I'm sure canvas

507
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:03,080
has been out for a while so you've

508
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,100
probably messed with it but just in case

509
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,960
you have it you can make a canvas

510
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,070
element you can get to make a video

511
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,799
element you get the context is how you

512
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,409
work with canvas and then you can draw

513
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:14,720
on to the context which draws with the

514
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,149
canvas an image and that first attribute

515
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,070
is our video tag so that's what I'm

516
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,960
dumping the webcam into and I'm just

517
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,240
reading it back off of that and then I

518
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,250
can do whatever I want so here's just an

519
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,830
example of how to grab the color of a

520
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,950
single pixel and here's another video

521
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,080
example and this one should work with me

522
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:45,280
so let's try it

523
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,700
okay so what this does is when it hits a

524
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,770
kick drum it's gonna splash the screen

525
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,020
but when it gets that chord sound it's

526
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,780
gonna randomly rotate with a rotate why

527
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,480
a CSS transition the whole thing and on

528
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,850
top of that is my pixel canvas and I'm

529
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,370
kind of changing the height based on

530
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:23,940
perspective where that is and hopefully

531
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,660
thank you so thanks for being here in

532
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,200
the first year scoff music video all

533
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,419
right so what are the problems with this

534
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:38,660
approach I don't want to get too into it

535
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,309
because it's nasty and annoying but

536
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:42,230
putting a web component in a reactor is

537
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,890
a terrible idea the virtual DOM and the

538
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,360
way we act works I think it somehow

539
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,590
triggers those connected and

540
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,840
disconnected callbacks all the time

541
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,179
so I just can't use them I try to get

542
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,130
around it for a couple of days and I run

543
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,720
out of time is like okay I'm just not

544
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,350
going to use it so instead you yeah

545
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,120
sorry then you just don't use them

546
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,850
another problem is that the nodes are

547
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,039
all evil if you edit a node and then

548
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,020
save it that causes a problem because

549
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,240
the custom elements already defined and

550
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,630
I can't redefine it so you can just

551
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,940
depend the date to the name of the tag

552
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,799
that you create and you're good

553
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:23,419
get attribute in the cut and the element

554
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:24,860
always return strings that's just kind

555
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,960
of how get attribute works so I don't

556
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,919
use it I get around it so I have my own

557
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:32,450
get attribute function and then I have

558
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,070
the native one that I've overridden that

559
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,419
you can still get to you also can't at

560
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,480
least I couldn't catch the errors so

561
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,520
when when you wrote like some JavaScript

562
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,380
in the app and then it ran and then you

563
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,909
got a value it would throw an error at

564
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:48,710
the whole thing we kind of just died so

565
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,320
I needed to basically wrap actually

566
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,970
change call back and so I have my own

567
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,909
attribute change call back as well

568
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:00,909
performance get a faster computer

569
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:03,799
actually no I did do a little bit of

570
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,870
work with this so react has should

571
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,690
component update which lets you try to

572
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,210
optimize the truth is I didn't get that

573
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,650
far into it and there's only so many

574
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,179
requests animation frames you can run

575
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:15,950
before your browser crawls

576
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,010
but that's future would so yeah there's

577
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,549
a lot of problems

578
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:23,399
whatever prior art if you've if you've

579
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:24,929
done any sort of visualization stuff

580
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:26,039
this probably looks somewhat familiar

581
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,539
turns out there's a lot of things that

582
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,279
do this when I started out I was

583
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,779
thinking oh man this is really cool

584
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,459
I've never seen like a visual like

585
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:34,709
modular software and know there's lots

586
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:38,639
of examples but these are really cool so

587
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:39,839
she I just recently learned about touch

588
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,940
designer looks super awesome so I

589
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,899
recommend you check it out if you're

590
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:47,099
interested into this last example is

591
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,289
they have a very cheesy synth wave song

592
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:52,229
with a demo so hopefully this works

593
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:55,259
so that basically just treating this

594
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:57,929
grid thing as input and output I have

595
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:00,419
these walls here so it's a little bit

596
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,369
hard to see but up in the corner I can

597
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:05,399
trigger the walls I can trigger the

598
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:08,159
background so all the examples have

599
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,679
shown hardware talking to JavaScript no

600
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,129
I don't use but you can use a loopback

601
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,169
meeting device for the software to talk

602
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:18,599
to itself so this is a logic file which

603
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:25,200
I will play so the walls are done on

604
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,899
every drum head and the background is

605
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,179
also pulsing with the drum head and I'll

606
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,669
use a hue rotate CSS transform in a

607
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:34,739
second on the MIDI notes that come in to

608
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,229
change the color and then after that

609
00:29:37,229 --> 00:30:12,239
there'll be one more thing

610
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:24,630
that's that's this part on the column

611
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,110
again that's all the code examples the

612
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,030
app is a big kid app it's on a super

613
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,420
cheap digital ocean box so I might crash

614
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,880
the code is public it's a big kid I'd

615
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,130
love to get pull requests it was made on

616
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,440
a deadline for this so it's a little bit

617
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,430
rough

618
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,020
I don't really is Twitter that much

619
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,220
anymore so if you want to follow me on

620
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,790
instagram i'm at zap underscore danger

621
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,770
and that's all i have the only thing i

622
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,420
didn't show you was the audio so you can

623
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,100
also read the microphone and put it in

624
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,550
there

625
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,930
so that's all I got
