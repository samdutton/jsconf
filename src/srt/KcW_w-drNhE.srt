1
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,900

I'm gonna be talking about responsive

2
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,610
talking about typography techniques like

3
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,530
slick just said and it's actually been a

4
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,990
really fun day so far I mean CSS

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,610
confident pretty cool for a first time

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,010

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,300
for you guys for having me it's been

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,610
really awesome and like it's a big honor

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,080
to be at the first time of a conference

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,670
that's really really cool I also

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,230
appreciate all of you guys letting me

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,120
talk about typography cuz I don't have

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,290
you notice so we've been talking about a

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,390
lot of like pretty crazy stuff I'm

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,280
pretty serious stuff and I'm like let's

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,149
talk about type yay so yeah at least one

17
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,710
other person so a couple things that I

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,350
do um I am the managing editor of

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,880
creative Jay Austin basically we collect

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,680
up a bunch of cool tutorials and

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,790
articles and things about fun stuff

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,949
people are doing with JavaScript and we

23
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,930
also teach some workshops I teach one of

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,030
those workshops obviously the coolest of

25
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,560
all the workshops that's the creative

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,960
jazz for designers because designer to

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,940
the coolest obviously we also run web

28
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,560
design day which is the day kind of like

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,970
this except in Pittsburgh so we don't

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,390
have any ocean or Sun so anyways um but

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,700
we do talk about web design in a lot I'm

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,069
so very running that for a while also I

33
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,899
think just like last week I released or

34
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:30,750
five simple steps released my book the

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,240
pocket guide to CSS animations it has

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,440
exactly nothing to do with what I'm

37
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,690
talking about today like literally

38
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,220
nothing at all there will be no talk of

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,569
animations but if you're into those you

40
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:46,560
might want to check it out so um I just

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,190
realized one thing that is missing and

42
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:57,330
I'm not sure if I can get it back sorry

43
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,899
that's how you can tell I'm Canadian I

44
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:01,350
just apologized for fixing my screen oh

45
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,729
you guys do get any do you pay there's

46
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,530
gonna be better jokes not okay so we've

47
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,460
just been talking about things like

48
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,259
viewport sizes and checkboxes and all

49
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,090
this stuff and I figured that maybe you

50
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,620
know to get everyone thinking about type

51
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,150
and to get in like a typography kind of

52
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,519
mood we could play a little game maybe

53
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,069
up for it okay good you guys are a

54
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:19,540
little bit of laughs so um the game I

55
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,920
want to play is called font or fish

56
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,360
basically oops well we already ought to

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,349
the first question I put a name up on

58
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:27,370
the screen you tell me if you think it's

59
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,239
a font or a fish so this one fish yay oh

60
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,530
and don't you love these like keynote

61
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,720
transitions amazing all right how about

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,290
this one

63
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,140
yes you guys are a little too you gonna

64
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,580
shut away these harder this one i

65
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,610
stumped you on one but this is fun isn't

66
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,910
it um how about this one yes it's a fish

67
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,860
isn't it cute last one yes awesome

68
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,739
all right so everyone's about set to

69
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,150
start talking about typography right

70
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,329
yeah yeah I'm so glad you guys play my

71
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:04,030
game that's really cool um all right so

72
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,040
a couple things we have in this talk

73
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,630
will list of exactly four actually we're

74
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,950
gonna talk about or I'm going to show

75
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,989
you some three approaches for awesomely

76
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,900
readable body text in responsive design

77
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,370
I'm gonna hopefully prove to you that

78
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,810
even just the smallest bit of attention

79
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,910
to your type can give you huge awesome

80
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,260
results for your designs

81
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,450
um there's only one very sad cat I'm

82
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,549
sorry and any number of terrible jokes

83
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,819
might be sorry about that too but really

84
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,170
the main thing is there's no one way to

85
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,850
do any of this stuff I'm sharing what

86
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,530
works for me and what seems to work for

87
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,790
some other people I hang out with as

88
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,340
well um but I find that responsive

89
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,170
design has really changed my process a

90
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,410
lot and it's very much involving so this

91
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,060
is the stuff I'm doing now maybe I'll

92
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,019
come up with a better idea tomorrow

93
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,250
maybe you guys will come up with a

94
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,720
better idea tomorrow and that's kind of

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,290
the fun part about sharing so oh well

96
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,200
let's start with some science that

97
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,579
typography probably never killed anyone

98
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,500
um I put probably in just in case

99
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,700
there's any like lawyers or

100
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,079
fact-checking people in the world maybe

101
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,850
it has happened but chances are it

102
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,930
hasn't happened very

103
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,180
um so you know there's also been the

104
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,439
worst thing that could probably happen

105
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,239
with bad typography is you can look a

106
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,500
little bad maybe you can look a little

107
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,209
bit like out of style a little bit

108
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,430
awkward a little bit ugly but it's not

109
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,829
really gonna hurt anything you know

110
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,820
worst thing you might look a little

111
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,229
below average but they're not gonna be

112
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,810
like painfully hurting anyone there's

113
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,550
been some scientific studies even just

114
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,229
particularly this one the aesthetics of

115
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,729
reading it's great Ani on the screen but

116
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,590
whatever one of the things they proved

117
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,479
is that it actually doesn't make a

118
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,530
difference if you're reading good

119
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,449
typography or bad typography you still

120
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,099
retain the same information you still

121
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:42,610
read the same speed so like about

122
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,810
typography doesn't slow you down good

123
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,280
typography doesn't make your job of

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,270
reading easier

125
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,070
so you're kind of like alright well

126
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,320
that's sort of weird um but this thing

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,570
study also proved that or found that

128
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,250
good typography induces a good mood and

129
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,360
that's probably something you've heard

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,190
quoted before a lot of a lot of tight

131
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,870
people like to bring it up but what they

132
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,430
found which i think is really cool is

133
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,530
they gave people something to read and

134
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,240
they had like their one section of

135
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,530
people read something that was set in

136
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,330
bad typography but they gave them like a

137
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,710
present first they're like here you go

138
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,539
here's a present go read this bad

139
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,760
typography and at the end those people

140
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,320
were in just as good of a mood or the

141
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,180
same good mood as the people who were

142
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,039
given no present but got to read good

143
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,889
typography so the obvious conclusion is

144
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,539
good typography is like giving your

145
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,770
users are present right but I mean maybe

146
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,110
not that literal but it's actually true

147
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,820
having good typography puts people in a

148
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,190
good mood makes you look better and you

149
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,630
know having people in a good mood having

150
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,699
people more you know thinking more

151
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,020
highly of you is a pretty good thing to

152
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,449
gain by good typography and of course a

153
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,400
little bit of time on typography will

154
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,110
give you really really great results if

155
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,460
you spend even just a few minutes at any

156
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,750
point in time in your process or any

157
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,060
point in your process you'll get some

158
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,740
really good results and it's not

159
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,050
something that you even need to be you

160
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,240
know a type typography expert for just

161
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,470
by paying attention to a few the things

162
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,090
I'll list out you're gonna be so much

163
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,860
more awesomer at typography and that's

164
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,909
awesome ur is totally a word but

165
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:05,289
responsive web design has totally

166
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:06,340
changed the way we think about web

167
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,680
typography um you know suddenly we were

168
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
doing this thing where we're setting

169
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,889
type that's what you call it you and if

170
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,300
it's CSS and stuff studying type because

171
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,550
we were serious type people as web

172
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,990
designers now even though one day we

173
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,150
weren't now we

174
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,090
um not that I'm scarred by that or

175
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,940
anything so we're suddenly putting type

176
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,290
in these containers that can change any

177
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,400
size at any time and we're basically

178
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,110
like making our sites and containers do

179
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,610
this all the time and we're gonna throw

180
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,130
type in there and we're doing it on

181
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,770
purpose so we used to set up our tower

182
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,810
style rules for type just once right we

183
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,920
just set them once to be like we're done

184
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,660
it's a fixed container it's good and if

185
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,340
we do that now you know we just set our

186
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,710
styles for text once the same styles

187
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,270
that give us this which maybe isn't so

188
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,920
bad it's some small text in a small

189
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,300
little container maybe it's like some

190
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,250
sort of mobile eview or something but

191
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,950
the same styles that give us that give

192
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,520
us this

193
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,900
on larger screens when it becomes

194
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,710
responsive um and this is not okay this

195
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,360
is completely horrible and no one would

196
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,440
ever want to read it like it's

197
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,360
impossible to read even if it wasn't so

198
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,040
small just having line lengths that long

199
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,690
no one would ever want to read it and

200
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,670
sadly with responsive design we've been

201
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,560
subjecting to people reading our sites

202
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,630
to things very similar to this way more

203
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,130
than we should not saying anyone this

204
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,840
room has done it yeah you've seen it

205
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,600
you've gone decides to spin like what is

206
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,330
going on um and and so we need to stop

207
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,650
this on the internet because in fact

208
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,690
when you put line lengths this long on

209
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,430
the internet and makes the cat's behind

210
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,950
the internet cry and we really can't do

211
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,310
that so if not if nothing else cats are

212
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,540
on the internet and long line lengths

213
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,020
make them cry all right on a roll so now

214
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,400
we've established that everyone wants to

215
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,420
keep their line lengths in check

216
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,480
obviously um responsive web design or

217
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,640
typography for responsive web design my

218
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,260
titles are getting so long you know what

219
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,930
kind of goals might that have you know

220
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,190
if things have changed we've got these

221
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,570
flexible containers what goals are we

222
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,120
going for now I would suggest that we

223
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,920
kind of have two goals to be consistent

224
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,140
in some way shape or form like visually

225
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,820
hopefully somewhat consistent to help

226
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,860
project a consistent message or some

227
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,760
crazy idea like that

228
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,250
um and also to be easily readable no

229
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,960
matter what size or what sort of

230
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,540
situation you're being viewed in it

231
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,970
sounds like a couple pretty good goals

232
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,470
so let's look at how to meet them

233
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,730
because clearly that's where I'm going

234
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,980
with a list like this so what can we do

235
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,680
to bring more more consistency to our

236
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,430
type in responsive web design the very

237
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,410
first thing the main thing we can do is

238
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,350
to set a scale because consistency makes

239
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,279
you look good

240
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,860
and the first thing everyone says when I

241
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,719
talk about a typographic scale is that

242
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,099
Robert bring her said you should use one

243
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,639
right of course totally heard that and

244
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,259
he did see it's right there

245
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:44,019
he totally did say that but here about

246
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:44,980
this book originally like a gajillion

247
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,529
years ago in internet time why should we

248
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,389
listen to this now so I have an even

249
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:50,740
better reason and that's the consistency

250
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,319
factor the idea of keeping a consistent

251
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:55,839
look to your type really makes you look

252
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,279
way more professional looks things more

253
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,500
planned out and more composed and that

254
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,240
consistency helps carry a similar feel

255
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,279
across the board of any server size of

256
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,990
that your types being viewed at and it's

257
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,309
not like people reading your site are

258
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:08,740
going to be like hmm looking at this on

259
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,420
my phablet I've noticed that the ratio

260
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,399
between the h2 and h3 is exactly the

261
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,379
same as it was on my desktop but they're

262
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:17,199
never gonna say that because that sounds

263
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,870
ridiculous but in their minds people

264
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,490
recognize that and that consistency is

265
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,079
totally gonna do you some favors and

266
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,430
then there's also the idea of

267
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,470
consistency being having a consistent

268
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,059
base having something that already looks

269
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:29,889
good is gonna be a hundred million times

270
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:31,720
easier maybe not a hundred million but

271
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,100
at least a hundred times easier for you

272
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,199
to adjust as you go I tend to exaggerate

273
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,569
numbers anyway it's a scale equals

274
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,670
consistency and that is really really

275
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,480
awesome so has anyone has anyone here

276
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,160
worked with typographic scales before a

277
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,959
few just a little bit okay we're talking

278
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,079
about some math for a second so

279
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:54,309
typographic scale is really just a ratio

280
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:56,470
and this one is the golden ratio which I

281
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,790
don't know if you've noticed but a lot

282
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,410
of times on the internet we find out it

283
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,790
exists in little dotted lines and

284
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,199
triangles and all the logos of all of

285
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:04,509
the worlds and that may not actually be

286
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,490
true I think that gets added later it's

287
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,300
a bad design joke anyways um it's

288
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,470
basically a ratio where you take a

289
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,360
certain you know you multiply the

290
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,649
different sizes in your type so if you

291
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,269
start at like 12 you multiply to get the

292
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:17,740
next size IP multiplied by one point six

293
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,089
eight and you keep going until you get a

294
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:21,220
list of numbers like this and maybe this

295
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,660
would be in pixels if I was using that

296
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,360
scale I rounded them because decimals

297
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,639
and pixels make me feel weird

298
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,689
you could also do the same thing with

299
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:29,980
thumbs and it might look like that

300
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,860
decimals and M's are totally okay and

301
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,939
you would get these numbers from

302
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:35,589
someplace well you could just make them

303
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:36,610
up yourself by doing a little

304
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,259
multiplication but I like to get them

305
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:40,660
from modular scale comm which is a tool

306
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,240
that Tim Brown put together

307
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,320
then you can just enter in a couple

308
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,580
numbers hit go and I'll do all this

309
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,320
multiplication for you it'll give you

310
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,510
sizes and pixels M's based sixteen M's

311
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,810
and percent of thirteen first three are

312
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,800
pretty useful I'm not really sure

313
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,560
percent of thirteen is and these scales

314
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,820
that have as much meaning or as little

315
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,350
meaning as you want you've probably read

316
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,730
some articles sometimes are people are

317
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,350
like oh and I picked this scale because

318
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,360
it was like based off a major fifth

319
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,370
and this font was designed by Beethoven

320
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,279
or something I made that up and it was

321
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,350
horrible but you know that they had

322
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,670
these crazy stories about why they

323
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,320
picked his scale and that those are

324
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,550
great stories but that's not an

325
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,770
important part of picking a scale if you

326
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,420
pick a typographic scale and you want to

327
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,070
use it because you like it and it looks

328
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,360
good and it fits what you're trying to

329
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,850
do that's enough reason for me you don't

330
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,080
have to have you can make up a story

331
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,279
like that if you want but you don't have

332
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,430
to have have a story like that and one

333
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,870
other thing about scales is that scales

334
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,450
or not gospel basically you get this

335
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,860
list of numbers and you can use those to

336
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,240
assign your different type sizes you

337
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
know pick your size pure H to use your H

338
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,350
ones and everything else but you know if

339
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,459
you're if you're looking at a scale like

340
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,070
Oh apparently have to go through this

341
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,940
way if you're looking at a scale like

342
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,950
this and you decide like oh you know I

343
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,410
decided my h2s we're gonna be 25 pixels

344
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,660
in size but I'd really like them to be

345
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,339
just a little bit smaller don't throw

346
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,839
out your scale just set it to like 22

347
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,420
and be fine with it because you as a

348
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,070
human with eyes and a brain are smarter

349
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,540
than straight-up math anytime when it

350
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,800
comes to what looks right and what looks

351
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,110
more balanced so you can always fudge

352
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,510
them a little for the human factor all

353
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,770
right so that's what we can do for

354
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,810
consistency and scales if you haven't

355
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,430
used them or typographic scales despite

356
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,720
them sounding may be a little bit weird

357
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,500
are pretty darn awesome to use for that

358
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,810
um so what can we do to typeset well in

359
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,730
our containers are flexing all over the

360
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,170
darn place so um there's three main

361
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,459
things we need to consider when it comes

362
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,500
to balancing readable type or keeping

363
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,660
type readable and if I was like an

364
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,370
infomercial right now I would have like

365
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,750
well actually already did have flash

366
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,399
bulbs and little explosions didn't I

367
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,589
well I have more of those and I probably

368
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,630
tell you like I could sell you for $9.99

369
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,490
the three secrets to like setting type

370
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,890
and well three secrets to setting

371
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,600
readable type but I'm not gonna get that

372
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,370
crazy with it because that's sort of

373
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,290
silly but there's three things that are

374
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,510
kind of considered the I guess macro

375
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,100
typography or something like that the

376
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,970
three things you will need to have

377
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,610
imbalance to keep type readable

378
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,850
- sighs second is letting and the third

379
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,530
is measure those are the super

380
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,870
typographic names for them in CSS they

381
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,470
are font size line height and width yay

382
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,420
so those three things looking at just

383
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,620
those three things you can get stuff

384
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,340
looking amazingly readable very easily

385
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,660
when a body of text is hard to read one

386
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,160
of these three things is out of whack so

387
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,010
they all are kind of related do do and

388
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,810
as you kind of adjust them with their

389
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,280
fancy little faders you can pretend

390
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,840
that's what we're really doing if you're

391
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,060
just any one of them or change any one

392
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,380
of them especially drastically if you

393
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,850
need to adjust the other two to make

394
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,500
something that's still more balanced and

395
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,390
the relationship isn't like a linear

396
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,280
mathematical thing it's not like well if

397
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,470
you increase measure by two pixels you

398
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,820
must increase letting by half a pixel

399
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,000
it's nothing that literal and that

400
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,100
linear it's more just by you know when

401
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,180
you adjust one you have to get your

402
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,160
balance back and the goal isn't really

403
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,600
like black and white rules of like this

404
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,610
is better it's more of just a goal of

405
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,440
creating something that's in good taste

406
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,510
and we all have pretty good taste I mean

407
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,070
we're here right so we can do that so

408
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,870
also according to Robert burgers the

409
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,060
optimal length or the most optimal

410
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,110
length for a comfortable measure of

411
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,090
reading is 45 to 75 characters I

412
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,530
probably heard that sometimes too it

413
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,960
comes up kind of a lot that's considered

414
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,250
a comfortable measure for reading line

415
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,980
length on the Internet I've noticed that

416
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,870
we've kind of changed just a little bit

417
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,460
sort of interesting so I know a lot of

418
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,870
you guys probably read sites and then

419
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,190
totally go and count the characters per

420
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,520
line but if you did because you know if

421
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,220
you haven't already I mean we tend to go

422
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,050
up to around 100 pretty easily and those

423
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,340
things are actually still pretty easy to

424
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,570
read so 45 ish to 100 or 45 to 75 up to

425
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,350
100 main point is that it's arranged and

426
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,640
we're really dealing with ranges here

427
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,430
there's no I mean kind of like what Mike

428
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,600
was just saying earlier it's like

429
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,820
there's kind of no absolutes right like

430
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,040
pixels are about this close to becoming

431
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,900
meaningless right now for web design so

432
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,030
everything is ranges and things that

433
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,020
look good within a certain range

434
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,940
characters per line of what's readable

435
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,180
is also a range so it kind of fits with

436
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,350
that a little bit

437
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,260
all right so what can we do with its

438
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,790
information and actually maybe get to

439
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,740
some code because you know there has to

440
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,140
be code in this talk so one approach I

441
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,430
like to use for keeping line lengths in

442
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,490
check is something that I like to call a

443
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,350
typed weak points I'm pretty sure I

444
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,850
didn't invent that name but it sounds

445
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,060
cool

446
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,830
and basically it's approach number one

447
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,600
for keeping or my first approach for

448
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,640
keeping text comfortably readable no

449
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,050
matter what you're containing size might

450
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,180
be um and tweet points that's a pretty

451
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,430
cool term that I first heard from the

452
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,550
spark box guys out of Ohio and I really

453
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,780
like the idea of them cuz it's the idea

454
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,980
of like it's not like your design is

455
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,300
broken it's just like there's these

456
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,740
points where things just need a little

457
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,900
bit of help that's yeah that's kind of

458
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,760
more what's going on so these are

459
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,610
actually creating a set of media queries

460
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,110
or a set of breakpoints or tweet points

461
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,820
whatever you want to call them better

462
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,380
type-specific I actually make a whole

463
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,280
set just for the type um and I find them

464
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,090
this is crazy

465
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,950
by checking and and like actually

466
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,390
reading things and checking them on

467
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,250
various devices and sizes for the

468
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,570
examples I'm going to show you today I

469
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,850
have a super simple like stripped down

470
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,650
just type example so we can look at the

471
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,830
styles that will actually affect that

472
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,090
it's definitely not the most practical

473
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:07,960
and we're just gonna look at it by

474
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,730
resizing our browser but obviously in

475
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,140
the real world we'd actually look at

476
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,910
this on you know actual device things

477
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,700
and that sort of thing oh and I should

478
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,520
also point out actually no I'll point

479
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,160
that out later so two points what what

480
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,170
we do to kind of do this of this

481
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,780
approach start with using a scale using

482
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,300
relative units like ends or rooms I'm

483
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,000
actually going to use I mean I'm gonna

484
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,980
be using rounds because I've kind of

485
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,090
noticed they've got some decent for

486
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,890
these days that's kind of cool

487
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,300
but em to be pretty much the same

488
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,360
situation um when line likes gets you

489
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,040
long according to our 45 to 75

490
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,440
characters ish we had a media query

491
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,150
which I have conveniently shortened to

492
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,660
MQ not sure why just for fun and we

493
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,790
adjust the base font size based on that

494
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,030
new width and then evaluate the font

495
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,380
size and line height from there just to

496
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,990
make sure we have some balance so that's

497
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,260
kind of the trick to it oh and adjust

498
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,180
more if needed of course there might

499
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,070
always be more to adjust so let's take a

500
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,910
look at what that looks like

501
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,160
so here's my super simple example it's a

502
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,780
super simple type centric I keep

503
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,890
fretting there's a screen over there to

504
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,000
both play

505
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,580
this simple example and we were just

506
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,530
thought to text it's conveniently from

507
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,120
Goldilocks cuz you know we're looking

508
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,340
for like a nice medium range of things

509
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,890
that's good right okay maybe it's not so

510
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,470
good and so it's the breakfast drama of

511
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,880
Goldilocks and the three bears

512
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,080
so I usually start out with something

513
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,480
kind of Moberly sighs something that's

514
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,280
gonna look good on the smallest size

515
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,880
kind of phone size here on the screen

516
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,130
looks a little tiny but on the phones it

517
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,840
looks kind of not it looks pretty good

518
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,250
so I was pretty happy with that as a

519
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,990
starting point and for my starting point

520
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,730
I had my base font size as it turns out

521
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,910
set to 75% I'm in the night signs all my

522
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,640
you know I'm in here my H ones I have

523
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,990
this like leading paragraph and then my

524
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,120
body text that was all set off the scale

525
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,040
that I used the same numbers from the

526
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,650
previous example from the previous scale

527
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,960
list sorry so I had my bought by

528
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,300
original fonts our base phone so I set

529
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,880
to 75% and the one thing I point out is

530
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,200
that the line height was set to one

531
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,310
point four which is a unitless

532
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,250
measurement and while we can't do things

533
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,260
really in CSS like set a min line height

534
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,510
and Max lines light this is kind of a

535
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,430
close second so unitless is pretty

536
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,780
awesome for these it'll kind of scale

537
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,110
with a font size as I'm sure you knew

538
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,670
and then as in my lead-in paragraph I

539
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,000
set that font size to 1.618 so you might

540
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,410
remember from our fancy scale golden

541
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,620
ratio yeah that means it'll be amazing

542
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,970
bottom margin set from the scale as well

543
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,590
and a line height that's just a little

544
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,240
bit smaller because generally bigger

545
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,130
text little less line height is a good

546
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,600
idea and that's gonna usually look a

547
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,520
little more balanced and then I had some

548
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,520
stuff set for my h1 as well but I want

549
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,100
to get through all these to then usually

550
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,320
what I would do is throw in some lorem

551
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,060
ipsum some nice lorem ipsum with a

552
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,590
couple little asterisks in there one at

553
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,360
45 characters and and one at 75

554
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,800
characters in because I really hate

555
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,630
counting so this is a really good visual

556
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,880
way to do it and it's actually an idea I

557
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,650
stole from Trent Walt with you it

558
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,690
probably also does not like counting so

559
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,050
I think that's why I think he's cool um

560
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,520
that might be the only yeah cuz that's

561
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,110
one reason to read people I also don't

562
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,510
like counting yeah so we have those in

563
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,770
there and then we basically just start

564
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,410
seeing what happens when our containing

565
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,720
when our page gets bigger and our main

566
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,970
texts container or it gets bigger and

567
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,410
bigger so eventually we hit a point

568
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,850
where we have those two Asterix on one

569
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,520
line or like

570
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,690
yeah this is probably getting a bit too

571
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,640
long to read yep I mean you'll see

572
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,929
notice on the body copy we have that

573
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:31,820
both on one line it's getting a bit feel

574
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,470
on to read our lead in paragraph that's

575
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,080
super huge and dynamic or dramatic

576
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,030
rather it's still doing okay but our

577
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,340
body copy needs some help so this point

578
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,920
I put in one of the typed weak points

579
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,510
which is basically setting a media query

580
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,960
ID approximately six 15 pixels and

581
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,420
bumping up the font size to 100 then I

582
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,860
should probably point out as I meant to

583
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,350
you before but then I stopped myself is

584
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,610
you know this code is definitely not the

585
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,780
kind of code you'd be like copy and

586
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,940
paste and use it in your in your own

587
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,590
projects write media queries however you

588
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:00,890
would like

589
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,690
you know you sass all that cool stuff

590
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,950
but this is just an easy way to

591
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,110
demonstrate it here on our super simple

592
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,940
example so um as we keep going we would

593
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,830
make some other changes maybe decide to

594
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,830
add another one in around 850 for this

595
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,160
one

596
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,900
a bumped up the font size and then that

597
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,190
font so I started looking a little bit

598
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,630
big so I made the line height a little

599
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,929
bit smaller as well and these sorts of

600
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:25,940
things there you can get a whole list of

601
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,440
rules of like when line height should be

602
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,570
smaller or bigger usually like larger

603
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,360
text you want a smaller line height

604
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,800
text that has lots of space within the

605
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,970
letters you want more line height but

606
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,860
really the easiest way to do it is to

607
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,120
find where things look a little broken

608
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,530
find where your line lengths look a

609
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,910
little bit too long and then start

610
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,320
adjusting things and see what looks

611
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,270
better to you because we're we're all

612
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,010
really good judges of what's easy to

613
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,330
read it's just a matter of taking the

614
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,370
time to look at it and adjust things and

615
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,809
if your first adjust that makes it look

616
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:53,000
worse try going the other way I think

617
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,170
that's the easiest way to learn this

618
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,610
stuff and you really get a feel for it

619
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,070
so we kept going and then in the very

620
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,880
end I ended up setting one for 1200

621
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,280
pixels and basically you know we would

622
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,360
end up with something that might look a

623
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,260
little like this oops

624
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,030
no we wouldn't that's the next place so

625
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,010
biggest question is you know for

626
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,420
something simple like this is where do

627
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,480
you stop and in real-life situations

628
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,250
when you're not just walking up a page

629
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,020
about Goldilocks you're gonna run into

630
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,100
something other than your attacks

631
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,380
needing to stop getting bigger maybe you

632
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,490
know you you don't want to be in a

633
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,870
situation where your text is this big

634
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,370
and you have like this little video or

635
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,750
this little image like something else in

636
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,429
your design will generally stop you and

637
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:30,050
have you have to put in a max width

638
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,840
somewhere and when that happens then

639
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,250
you're good to go but for this

640
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,480
particular one it was just kind of an

641
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,500
arbitrary one Bryce

642
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,240
my max width of my container at about

643
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,960
like 900 pixels or something like that

644
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,100
and these these tweet points that you

645
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,660
put in for the type don't just have to

646
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,850
be adjusting your font size on your line

647
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,960
height I think those are the first two

648
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,160
things you should look at to balance out

649
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,480
your reading but you can do more

650
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,820
interesting things as well for example

651
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,650
then you a list a part redesign they

652
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,290
actually switch out to Georgia Pro

653
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,750
condensed on their smaller viewport more

654
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,390
Moberly ish views and you can go tiss

655
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,710
looking at these little carefully

656
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,020
because they're very close the

657
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,180
characters in the left and one on the

658
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,340
mobile view one or the smallest one take

659
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,560
up less space than the ones that when

660
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,030
they get bigger so what they've done is

661
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,530
switch to a font that's a little more

662
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,940
condensed they can get more characters

663
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,850
in on these tiny or thin viewports

664
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,340
but still be able to keep the text

665
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,660
bigger because a lot of the time

666
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,400
depending on the font you pick you'll

667
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,390
notice when you get down to these

668
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,160
smaller viewport sizes to get a readable

669
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,080
length you start having a really small

670
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,520
font size and then it's like well is

671
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,650
that really more comfortable if it's a

672
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,870
good you know comfortable measure but

673
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,400
it's so tiny I'm like squinting at my

674
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,010
phone that's not comfortable anymore so

675
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,690
your font choices affect this as well I

676
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,370
think that's a pretty good trick and you

677
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,690
could even maybe do it bigger on the

678
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,700
other side you know a lot of web type

679
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,500
comes as display faces so you could do

680
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,150
something when it gets really big to put

681
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,590
in one of the display weights so that

682
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,490
our anything will look something like

683
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,780
this I'm just gonna go through it kind

684
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,120
of quick because we have two more so it

685
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,470
starts out small expands and gets bigger

686
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,050
we hit our various type tweet points and

687
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,850
then eventually it stops our container

688
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,290
stops getting bigger and we allow our

689
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,630
margins to get bigger instead so let's

690
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,490
type of graphic tweak points which is

691
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,570
the terrible name I've given this

692
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,820
approach that definitely is not

693
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,890
something I invented but something

694
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,900
that's get you gets used quite a bit so

695
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,520
we start with our scale using relative

696
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,960
units that's the biggest most important

697
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,250
thing and then we can adjust our base

698
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,170
font size to get our scale basically to

699
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,900
scale ha and we sent a cutoff point

700
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,460
based on some other factor usually then

701
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,590
our type and my own media queries ended

702
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,960
up looking like this so you might have

703
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,090
noticed that I switched from pixels to M

704
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,030
based media queries usually since it's

705
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,230
pretty easy to get something to tell you

706
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,450
how many pixels wide your browser is not

707
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,680
so easy get something to tell how many

708
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,200
Emmas wide it is I start with pixels and

709
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,160
then convert them over

710
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,260
I like the M based media queries a lot

711
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,720
better because it kind of makes you more

712
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,560
resolution independent

713
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,170
like if somebody is viewing is it kind

714
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,310
of doesn't matter how many pixels are

715
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,290
anymore ms which are essentially roughly

716
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,940
based on the 16 pixel increments

717
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,020
you know if they get bigger because

718
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,760
someone zooms in or something you have

719
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,590
fewer MS and then you might hit one of

720
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,300
your other media queries as well so it

721
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,980
really takes you away from pixels and

722
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,110
takes you away from that you know makes

723
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,700
you more resolution independent pretty

724
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,740
cool way to do it in cloud 4 has there

725
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,240
probably even though it's a little more

726
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,650
than a year old probably the best reason

727
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,660
of why you should move towards those on

728
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,900
their blog as well so to get these

729
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,220
particular numbers I just ended up

730
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,410
dividing by 16 but when it comes to the

731
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,820
M based stuff you kind of end up playing

732
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,170
things by ear a little bit more you know

733
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,700
relying less on actual numbers and

734
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,280
actual pixel pixels and just find those

735
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,890
good ranges so one problem with this

736
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,770
approach though is that M still equal ms

737
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,530
anymore you know if I have increased my

738
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,250
based font size my M's vertically yes I

739
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,540
screwed that up sometimes it's very

740
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,920
embarrassing when vertically have

741
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,030
actually gotten bigger they're not

742
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,340
approximately 16 pixels anymore right

743
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,260
but my M base needed queries going

744
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,660
horizontally are still based off the 16

745
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,790
pixel ratio they don't get bigger when I

746
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,060
increase my base font size um some

747
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,140
people have a really big problem with

748
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,540
this I'm actually kind of ok with it I

749
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,730
don't know if that makes me weird but I

750
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,110
tend to work in really small teams or

751
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,550
it's like making a developer or like me

752
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,110
and three other people and there's

753
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,400
probably only like two of us ever

754
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,020
touching the CSS so we can keep this

755
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,690
straight bigger teams maybe that's more

756
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,110
of a problem and really lately I've been

757
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,670
finding myself playing by ear more when

758
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,110
it comes to setting these typographic

759
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,310
tweak points of like where I actually

760
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,110
change things and relying less on

761
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,850
exactly how wide my browser window is

762
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,560
and just more on how things look and

763
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,970
maybe I should make a change here or

764
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,670
there so one other approach besides out

765
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,130
that we can do Emma five things that's

766
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,300
okay that was supposed to be funny title

767
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,430
it's alright but title wasn't funny

768
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,750
enough for you I totally have some

769
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,450
terrible puns in this subtitle so if

770
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,510
changing good yeah you guys are still

771
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:44,720
awake

772
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,680
you're like type makes me sleepy yeah um

773
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,270
if changing your base font size is a

774
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,890
problem which is often can be you know

775
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,600
if that making your M's not matches a

776
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,010
problem or other reasons is a problem

777
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,600
for you there's other ways to do this as

778
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,180
well and obviously by keeping things

779
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,740
constant by keeping your base font size

780
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,120
constant your M's will always be

781
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,630
approximate

782
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,360
based off 16 ish pixels like how all the

783
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,100
math we're doing now for responsive

784
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,690
design it's like approximately kinda

785
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,280
sorta it's like we have numbers and the

786
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,600
economy and stuff but the kind of dough

787
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,550
it's pretty cool it's great when you

788
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,160
like to make up numbers so to kind of

789
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,920
take this approach you want to measure

790
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,480
your column widths and ends and this is

791
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,150
maybe the main thing stopping

792
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,040
make-it-or-break-it point of people not

793
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,600
everyone likes to measure their wits and

794
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,980
and these people have grids that work in

795
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,390
percentages and all that kind of thing

796
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,260
and they don't want to get away from

797
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,910
that it's ok you don't have to do it

798
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,350
this way but if you do this is a good

799
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,700
way to do it um

800
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,670
you keep your base five pace font size

801
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,970
constant and then you can use keep your

802
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,590
containers fluid when they're smaller

803
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,300
and then when you get to a point a

804
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,830
certain point which we'll talk about one

805
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,450
second you stop letting anything get

806
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,710
bigger and you just let your margins get

807
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,950
bigger and you base that on an M value

808
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,380
because generally kind of sort of with

809
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,750
our fuzzy math some more there's any

810
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,070
like super math people in the house

811
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,190
they're probably starting to feel like

812
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,740
um but 1m is approximately like one of

813
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,690
them at least typographically is based

814
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,430
off of a capital M which is

815
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,220
approximately 2 ish characters for most

816
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,610
fonts so if we say 75 characters is our

817
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,530
maximum comfortable reading measure and

818
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,080
we divide that approximately by 2

819
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,550
somewhere in around 32 M should be the

820
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,370
max size of our of our main text

821
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,590
container and if it never goes over 32 M

822
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,360
s we'll never have more than 75

823
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,010
characters and we will always be at a

824
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,960
comfortable readable length yeah math um

825
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,280
so we would end up with something like

826
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,530
this when it's very small we keep it

827
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,840
nice and flexible oops sorry

828
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,550
that when we get to more more medium

829
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,800
length we're still a little flexible but

830
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,060
at some point in that sort of medium

831
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,940
range we hit our maximum 32 MS and then

832
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,040
when we do that things get a little bit

833
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,420
bigger but only our margins get bigger

834
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,160
and as we get bigger and bigger and

835
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,200
margins gets huger and huger if this

836
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,360
were a real project and not Goldilocks

837
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,500
and the three bears we might you know

838
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,180
kick up to two columns or something like

839
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,400
that but in this case it just hangs out

840
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,110
there in the center all bias lonely self

841
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,930
and our font sizes never actually change

842
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,940
so that's another approach to keeping

843
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,530
your line length in a comfortable way

844
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,900
but without having to make removable I

845
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,850
guess making fewer tweaks so

846
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,920
wits and everything in M's

847
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,310
keeps you nice and

848
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,870
resolution-independent that is pretty

849
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,000
awesome there's still an option to make

850
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,680
adjustments here there you know you can

851
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,940
make more adjustments if you want to and

852
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,990
make those little tweak points in

853
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,760
addition to doing this one and it

854
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,050
doesn't work well with all grid making

855
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,300
approaches I know some people who are

856
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,820
like the idea of making setting up their

857
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,020
grids and Emmas and they just kind of

858
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,160
like freak out and don't wanna talk to

859
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,610
me anymore

860
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,830
so it's okay I mean I'll get over it

861
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,050
I'll just do the other version instead I

862
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,340
end up having to work with a lot of

863
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,620
different teams so yeah I'm used to

864
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,230
adapting so one more approach since we

865
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,680
said we do three and I realized I have

866
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,910
no idea how I'm doing on time because my

867
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,260
counter didn't start so I'm sorry about

868
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,360
that one other approach that I've been

869
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,470
playing with a little bit and haven't

870
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,630
really gotten to use for real yet is V H

871
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:02,480
and V W B H is my favorite obviously get

872
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,220
it bow head VA okay like that's awesome

873
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,360
I have a unit named after me um either

874
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,500
get it knees don't really have enough

875
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,570
support to use anywhere real just yet

876
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,320
but they're really interesting um 100 V

877
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,210
W equals all of the you port width

878
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,610
essentially so one is like one percent

879
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,990
and you can set up something that will

880
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,730
constantly change the font size and even

881
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,930
like your margins and line height and

882
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,480
everything you want in all directions

883
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,680
based on your viewport and it just

884
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,450
changes all the time well except most

885
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,800
browsers make you refresh before it

886
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,690
updates but once they fix that all the

887
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,050
time

888
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,420
squishy it's great but it's kind of

889
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,200
drastic for example these two are both

890
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,340
set to 2 V W for font size this one

891
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,900
you're never gonna be able to read even

892
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,340
if that was on a real phone not gonna

893
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,730
happen

894
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,850
it's way too tiny so it kind of scales

895
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,740
to any proportion at all and when it

896
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,270
gets really big you know kind of looks

897
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,190
okay but it doesn't handle small size as

898
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,680
well but I do like what it's doing to my

899
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,900
heading I mean that's kind of cool a

900
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,490
little small and a small end to you but

901
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,690
it's maybe a little bit more of a

902
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,880
headings thing so these guys are

903
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,010
definitely fun because squishing things

904
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,000
in all directions and making your

905
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,650
margins change and your font size change

906
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,200
is really fun to do but it still needs

907
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,360
limits somewhere probably especially on

908
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,920
the low end because that text was so

909
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,930
tiny I don't even know if like a

910
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,070
magnifying glass would help you out

911
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,380
without it was pretty bad um and it's

912
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,940
pretty kick-ass for titles and display

913
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,380
copy I think that's the kind of place

914
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,920
these are really going to come in hand

915
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,090
places where you might have used

916
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,140
something like fit text and use

917
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,880
JavaScript to make sure it always made

918
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,230
your text size big enough to fill your

919
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,700
whole window you might be able to use

920
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,450
these instead

921
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:42,270
kind of nice okay so responsive design

922
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,830
strangely enough is more than just

923
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,510
making your boxes all flexi so

924
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,790
typography for responsive design is also

925
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,680
more than just fitting them into flexi

926
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,480
containers so I wanted to talk a little

927
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,820
bit about what we can do to make what we

928
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,230
can do with our type to make it I guess

929
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,700
basically more aware that we're under

930
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,290
different conditions not just in flexi

931
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,570
boxes but I realize I've been doing this

932
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,160
like all day like yeah this is my new

933
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,340
dance anyways so things we can do a type

934
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,900
that consider devices at least just a

935
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,450
little because we don't have any real

936
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,160
reliable way still to really find out

937
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,540
like what someone's connection speed or

938
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,340
anything is but we can kind of make some

939
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,650
assumptions and I'll go with the

940
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,640
assumptions for now until we have

941
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,830
something better so loading web fonts

942
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,200
can take a while it can take a really

943
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
long while you especially notice it on

944
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,750
mobile situations where you generally

945
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,100
speaking your connection might be a bit

946
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,080
slower for lack of a better way to

947
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,610
measure and you know you're gonna know

948
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,590
you're gonna see that you'll actually

949
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,180
notice this loading thing happens so

950
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,560
there's a couple things we can do to

951
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,570
make this happen more gracefully we can

952
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,670
use font stacks till I know things like

953
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,770
services like Typekit and font ACK and

954
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,510
everything they give you the CSS sample

955
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,340
it's usually like your awesome web type

956
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,860
and then like serif there should always

957
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,390
be something between your awesome web

958
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,060
type and Sara always you know just don't

959
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,070
just copy and paste that because

960
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,770
sometimes this is a little sad and

961
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,230
terrible sometimes your web fonts won't

962
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,300
load at all don't want to scare anyone

963
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,160
but it's true I mean not just in mobile

964
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,920
situations there's actually like um you

965
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,210
know ad blockers and stuff that will

966
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,650
block things like Typekit and then

967
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,880
suddenly you're on your fallback fault

968
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,130
so they better be awesome this is a

969
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,230
chart that is scary but true and it goes

970
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,600
to try to show you what font exists on

971
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,780
all mobile platforms none good luck with

972
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,760
that so basically at some point no

973
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,110
matter what on some devices you're gonna

974
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,640
be stuck with your basic serif or sans

975
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,790
serif um it's also possible to hide web

976
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,460
fonts from mobile situations if you want

977
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,380
to if you're okay with basing thin

978
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,750
viewport means probably mobile maybe not

979
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,030
really good connection speed and we can

980
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,740
do things like actually by not calling

981
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,530
our awesome

982
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,660
thought it won't get loaded but that's

983
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,970
only if you actually load in your web

984
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,430
font through pure CSS a little trickier

985
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,650
if you're using javascript but you know

986
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,930
JavaScript can handle that whole like if

987
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,730
this then that stuff too

988
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,350
I've heard of people taking some

989
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,730
approaches of creating like a light type

990
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,790
kit and have a type type type kit

991
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,110
one with fewer faults one with more

992
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,570
serving the lighter one to mobile and

993
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,850
this is a great article since I don't

994
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,380
have any time to get into it but CSS

995
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,880
tricks did some great things and

996
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,710
examples about preventing the

997
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,490
performance head of custom fonts they're

998
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,800
also web phone events that we can that

999
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,970
we can look into you and they are

1000
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,810
seriously awesome

1001
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,880
google has put these together and you

1002
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,050
can actually use the Google web font

1003
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,900
loader to get events of the situation

1004
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,030
every web font web fonts loading with

1005
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,400
any service or situation for loading web

1006
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,230
fonts that you want it comes built-in to

1007
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,790
type kit but you can set up this Google

1008
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,530
one even if you're rolling your own at

1009
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,570
font face setup the way it works to get

1010
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,370
some classes one for when your web fonts

1011
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,170
are loading called WF loading the naming

1012
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,900
structure is amazing obviously when

1013
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,070
they're in active means they have it

1014
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,300
loaded at all and when they're active

1015
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,470
and you can set some different styles

1016
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,840
based on that and this comes in handy

1017
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,640
especially for titles or really

1018
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,960
important text like tag lines or

1019
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,370
something like that where you want to

1020
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,470
really handle every detail of how it's

1021
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,450
going to get swapped out but from its

1022
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,340
default font or the fallback font but

1023
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,990
then what it gets one swapped out with

1024
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,610
once your web fonts load so you can

1025
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,020
control every step of the way on this

1026
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,060
and make sure that like when it's just

1027
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,770
set to plain old Sarah it still fits in

1028
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,120
the same box it's gonna fit in when

1029
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,159
you're using your good próximo Nova or

1030
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,330
whatever else so those are pretty handy

1031
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,560
whoo I've been going through a whole lot

1032
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,870
of stuff so the very last part that I

1033
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,580
want to talk about cuz I'm assuming I

1034
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,240
only have a couple minutes left is uhm

1035
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,530
responsive typography for the future I

1036
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,649
mean there's a lot more we can do with

1037
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:32,710
width type and fonts than just spitting

1038
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,149
them into flexi boxes and trying to

1039
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:35,169
figure out if we have a good connection

1040
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:37,060
speed or not to load our stuff and

1041
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,159
handling that loading function um one

1042
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,300
thing that's really interesting and I

1043
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,980
didn't talk about it too much is this

1044
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,290
the idea that um on Retina displays your

1045
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,820
fonts look different we've all seen it

1046
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,800
we've got you know high resolution

1047
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,149
phones or high density phones or

1048
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:50,230
everyone to call them Retina display

1049
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,129
phones and then regular old monitors

1050
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:55,679
and on ready display as your type is

1051
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,210
going to appear lighter even though it's

1052
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,740
not lighter basically because it's

1053
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,920
higher resolution so the folks over who

1054
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,750
make I a writer have actually done some

1055
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,250
things I've done some experimenting with

1056
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,380
graded fonts and basically these fonts

1057
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,150
are aware of you know what your

1058
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,799
resolution that you're dealing with is

1059
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:12,750
and they actually would serve up a

1060
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,609
slightly bolder version to Retina

1061
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:16,170
displays so that it ends up looking

1062
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,359
exactly the same as the coarser lower

1063
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:21,000
resolution version so it's like a font

1064
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,380
that knows what resolution it's being

1065
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,670
displayed at and adjusts itself

1066
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,160
accordingly that would be pretty cool to

1067
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,730
play with I think so that's one way that

1068
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,109
things could be getting pretty

1069
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:33,029
interesting another way thanks maybe

1070
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:34,349
part getting pretty interesting is

1071
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,819
there's I believe this is a series

1072
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:36,299
actually

1073
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:38,670
but that Nick has been writing on a list

1074
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,339
apart but he's suggesting that you know

1075
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,809
all fonts have some hinting included

1076
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,039
with them and that's basically

1077
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,119
instructions of how to make their

1078
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,029
awesome smooth curves translate to

1079
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:50,880
coarse harsh pixels and how that's gonna

1080
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,009
happen and hinting tells them how to do

1081
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,619
that but he suggested it maybe hinting

1082
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,960
could do more than that like what if the

1083
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,519
hinting instructions of your font could

1084
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,920
tell it hey skinny uh viewport maybe

1085
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,390
condense your characters a little bit

1086
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,859
give me a like a condensed version or

1087
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:06,960
like hey a really really big viewport

1088
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,609
why don't we go with the more wide

1089
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:11,160
version um so that kind of things those

1090
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,140
kinds of things could be actually

1091
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,910
embedded within our fonts and our fonts

1092
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,410
could be smart enough you know we

1093
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,430
wouldn't have to swap them out ourselves

1094
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,859
they could actually no I think that's

1095
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:22,380
kind of cool the idea of like pulling up

1096
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,880
a web font and loading it up and having

1097
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,200
it know like the resolution and

1098
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,730
adjusting for that knowing what kind of

1099
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,859
viewport size are dealing with smart

1100
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,190
fonts sound pretty awesome so the whole

1101
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,440
idea of responsive and typography I

1102
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,579
think is heading to some pretty

1103
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,529
interesting directions and I'm kind of

1104
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,059
excited about all this stuff and

1105
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:40,410
hopefully maybe you guys are a little

1106
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,299
bit too so that wraps up our journey of

1107
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:46,950
typography for responsive design a lot

1108
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,109
to cover in like 30 minutes so thanks

1109
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,359

1111
