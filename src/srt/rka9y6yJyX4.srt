1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,310
Michael Henretty - VoiceHTML - Speech Recognition
as a Progressive Enhancement.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,310
Alright.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,310
Cool, thanks, everyone for showing up today.

4
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:11,250
I appreciate your coming out and hearing about
voice.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,349
I work for Mozilla.

6
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:13,860
I'm a web engineer.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,800
These days, I work on Open Innovation, and
I will talk about that in a second.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,170
The project I'm working on is called Common
Voice, which is Mozilla's initiative to crowd

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,750
source a large set of data voices to be used
in speech technology.

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,070
We're trying to solve the data problem for
machine learning and voice.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,220
We're currently working on multiple languages
meaning languages other than English.

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,930
If you're interested in collecting speech
data for your language, reach out to me.

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,750
I have some contact info there.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:55,620
Today, we're going to talk about voice HTML,
the web and app stores.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,250
We're going to do a brief history of the web,
and then get into my VoiceHTML proposal, like

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,490
I promised, and then a case study on booking
a flight with VoiceHTML.

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,930
I will try to get into Q&A if we have time
for that.

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,400
Disclaimers.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,070
I hate doing them but I will need to this
time.

20
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:26,270
If you read the pitch, the pitch that I gave
you was more of click bait to get people here

21
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,530
interested in voice and interested in the
internet.

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,979
I made some bold statements there that I'm
going to propose a new protocol and propose

23
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,909
a case study on the protocol.

24
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:37,900
It might not be the protocol you might think.

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,369
This is not a technical talk.

26
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm not going to release a library or an API.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,229
This is going to be more about trust.

28
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:50,659
I hope that you will bear with me as we talk
about this today, because this is maybe a

29
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,260
little different than what you're expecting.

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,320
I hope it will be good.

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,780
VoiceHTML.

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:03,759
So, around the end of 2016, I had finished
my last very successful project at Mozilla

33
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,200
called Firefox OS - you might have heard of
it!

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,810
I moved over to the Open Innovation team.

35
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,860
What I was doing was trying to what Open Innovation
team does is reach out to other teams within

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:22,750
Mozilla and get them to be more successful
by embracing open practices.

37
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:31,670
I was working on a project called Dynotank
which is an ideas contest.

38
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:38,700
Pretty much anybody who was interested in
Dynotank can submit ideas to Dynotank and

39
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,690
then we have a team of executives who you
would pitch to if we like your idea, and then

40
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,020
the top ideas get selected to be worked on.

41
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,620
For working on it be we would do a week of
a design-thinking design sprint.

42
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,459
We would have about eight different people
from all sorts of different walks of life

43
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,180
and skill sets, and we would investigate the
problem and see if we can build anything there.

44
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,709
One of those ideas was querying the voice-enabled
internet.

45
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,920
How can the internet and voice play well together?

46
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:17,390
One of the concepts that came out of the design
sprint - you can see it here a bit, was VoiceHTML.

47
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:24,680
That text says, "Voice analogy of HTML allows
simple authoring of apps that can understand

48
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,840
speech and speak."

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,190
Everyone loved this idea.

50
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,920
It had by far the most votes.

51
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,390
Those little blue dots are votes.

52
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,930
We really wanted to explore this.

53
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,670
What I would like to do is explore the topic
of VoiceHTML by exploring what the web is,

54
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,709
so we're going to do like a brief history
here.

55
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,019
Okay.

56
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,470
So let's start with the web.

57
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,489
Why do we like it?

58
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:54,840
Why is it so great?

59
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,459
Why would anybody want to use the web over
competing models which we will talk about

60
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,459
in a second?

61
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:06,459
As a developer, the apps you make are easy
to make, they're cross-platform, you don't

62
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:12,360
have to worry about gatekeepers, there's no
revenue-sharing model or no approval process.

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,599
As a user, we love the web.

64
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,380
That's what we use on desktop.

65
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,900
Your computers are now basically browsers
with a couple of other apps.

66
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,119
The reason we like it is work flow.

67
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:28,570
We have multiple tabs open, we have email,
calendar, looking up concert tickets while

68
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:35,900
Wikipedia-ing things and it is seamless and
quick to get things done.

69
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,039
We love that we don't have to install.

70
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,029
And these last two points are really important.

71
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:45,949
We will talk about them and focus on them
today.

72
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:48,509
There's an established trust model for the
internet.

73
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,080
We know how to trust it.

74
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,759
We put our credit card information in there,
and our social security tax ID in there, so

75
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,759
we trust it.

76
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,180
It's taken as while to get there, and I would
like to explore that a little bit.

77
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,729
We have choice: there's a ton of choice on
the internet.

78
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:09,000
I can choose the device that I'm using - I
can use a desktop, a phone, I can use any

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,210
number of IOT devices.

80
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,129
You can choose what browser, what sites you're
using.

81
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:18,689
The choice is really paramount to what the
web is.

82
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:23,599
Okay, but, the web is not the only model that
is extremely successful right now.

83
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:28,430
There are other models out there, and I think
we need to examine a little bit.

84
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,970
Because, with all these great things, why
would anyone choose anything different?

85
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,669
Let's look at it.

86
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,839
App stores: that's the other big model, right?

87
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,089
An app store, love it or hate it, they're
extremely successful, and actually pretty

88
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:43,099
nice.

89
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:49,909
Let's talk about why they're nice: as a developer,
the SDK and the IPA moves fast.

90
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,289
There's no consensus needed.

91
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,270
A single group of people can decide and a
lot of people follow suit.

92
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,080
That's good as a developer because things
move very quickly.

93
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,930
I don't know if any of you are iOS developers
but you get a lot of updates and it's very

94
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,930
exciting.

95
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,919
Next, you have a direct channel to your users.

96
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,059
You know exactly where they are because there's
only one place they can be.

97
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:13,649
It's not like the web.

98
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:19,599
Then performance: you can optimise specifically
for your platform much easier than this kind

99
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:24,569
of cross-platform that we love about the web.

100
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,110
As a user now, why do users like app stores?

101
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,330
There's an easy trust model.

102
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,589
I can trust that app store and everything
that comes out of that app store, I can trust.

103
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:41,159
The other day, I had to make a meme picture
I sent to my family, and I went and downloaded

104
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,669
five apps from the app store.

105
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:46,099
I didn't care or worry about it, I just did
it.

106
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:51,919
Whether or not that's a good thing, it is
nice as a user not to have to think about

107
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,840
what I'm visiting and what I'm doing.

108
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,749
Also, the content is curated and tailored
more me, and also for the store.

109
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:04,209
I generally like the stuff that comes up,
the stuff that surfaced to the top of the

110
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,209
app store, of app stores.

111
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,209
Then of course performance.

112
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,209
I love performance.

113
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:11,759
The web is great, it's moving along, but it
doesn't hold a candle to a native app.

114
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,460
If you're making a video game, which I used
to do in a former life, you wouldn't do the

115
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,460
web, unfortunately.

116
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
You wouldn't use HTML/5.

117
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:28,530
You can, but you're getting difficulty getting
to the same level as an app, as an app is

118
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,530
with default.

119
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,770
There is a third value pool that we need to
talk about: the owner of that place.

120
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,560
There is no owner of the web.

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,169
There are owners of app stores, and, of course,
they love it because they get 30 per cent.

122
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,159
That's their standard cut.

123
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,979
Also, they get to control the experience for
their users.

124
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,089
They need to show exactly what they see.

125
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:49,650
They can limit competition.

126
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,699
If you compete with a business model of someone
who owns an app store, they're not going to

127
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,050
let you into that app store.

128
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,469
This is really important.

129
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:03,469
So we've talked a little bit about the difference
between Web and app stores.

130
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:09,360
Let's talk about where this competition came
from, and we're going to take a journey back

131
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
in time.

132
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,149
We will start with 2007.

133
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:14,529
Steve Jobs.

134
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:19,629
Let me just say it: we went native third-party
applications on the iPhone.

135
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:25,919
You may not remember, before this time, before
he said this, the web was dominant on mobile.

136
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,919
Even on iPhone.

137
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,659
The iPhone existed before the app store.

138
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:36,769
There were a lot of reasons why the web was
a great killer app for phones especially because

139
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,300
of Steve Jobs, actually.

140
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,432
He added a lot of these features you see here
- GPS and maps, he did that, actually.

141
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:44,432
He made it really good.

142
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:46,240
You can make phone calls.

143
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,709
If you see a phone number, you can make a
phone call.

144
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,399
You can add things to your home screen, like
book marking to your home screen.

145
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,680
That was a new concept.

146
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,139
And then this pinch-to-zoom double tap, it
was a way to use desktop web pages on your

147
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,139
phone.

148
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,870
At the time, there were other phones that
were smartphones that had the web, and they

149
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,850
weren't a great experience.

150
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,750
In the early days, Steve Jobs was really bullish
about the mobile web.

151
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,230
When he released the iPhone, he said this:
what is the developer story?

152
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,670
We've got the web, baby.

153
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,620
We've got Safari, the best mobile browser
out there.

154
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,350
He had a reason to be optimistic.

155
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,139
It had a great SDK and tooling already.

156
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,139
You already had documentation.

157
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:36,000
You already had this vast distribution platform,
you had content discovery figured out.

158
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,899
So it's a no-brainer.

159
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:41,410
Then he beat all of the existing browsers
that were out there.

160
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,430
Look at the Blackberry versus his phone.

161
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,889
This was a similar time.

162
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:50,920
He had touch versus scroll wheel, double-touch,
bigger screens and incredible performance.

163
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,980
For a while, the web was the killer app on
the phones.

164
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,480
How long was that?

165
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:06,540
Let's look: June 2007, he said, 2.0 applications,
and then, October 2007, native app store.

166
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,620
That's about three months where the web was
amazing on phones.

167
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,750
But it was a great time.

168
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,250
But however, the iPhone was not the first
smartphone.

169
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,720
There were other phones that were around before
the iPhone, and the web was a killer app.

170
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,069
You had the world's knowledge in your pocket.

171
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:29,689
You had transactions; you had vast communities
discussing various niche topics.

172
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,910
You had to have it on your phone.

173
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,910
Why wasn't it a killer app?

174
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,420
We have to look at that?

175
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:41,139
We have to go back to 1995, the boom of the
internet, this is where everything happened.

176
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:42,139
One year.

177
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,139
It is amazing.

178
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,939
We had JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, all released
1.0, that year.

179
00:10:47,939 --> 00:11:01,829
Internet explorer, Opera, Amazon, the first
Wiki web, the first WYSIWYG editor for HTML,

180
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,170
and then the first computer wiretaps.

181
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,930
That's pretty important.

182
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,509
Phones were rudimentary at this time but they
had the web.

183
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:14,329
You can see over here there is in Nokia, the
first phone that had internet capabilities

184
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,379
on, email check and map functionality.

185
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:21,180
It was a huge boon for phones.

186
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,610
Why is this good?

187
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,220
The web had trust figured out.

188
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,240
I could put my credit card in the web at this
time.

189
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I could make payments.

190
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,290
Amazon was around, or Amazon became around
because of that.

191
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,709
Then discovery.

192
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:38,990
Discovery is a really important and difficult
concept when you're trying to make a distribution

193
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,990
platform.

194
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,269
The web did it really well.

195
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,589
Let's say I wanted to look up my favourite
move, You've Got Mail.

196
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:47,100
How would I do that?

197
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,050
I would search for it.

198
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,279
If we talk about search and where it came
from, there's only one company we ever need

199
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,010
to talk about, right?

200
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,779
Infoseek!

201
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:07,009
The year before, Infoseek came round and revolutionised
search.

202
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:16,689
They did real time search updates, and they
did cost-per-click ads which changed the game,

203
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:20,319
and behavioural targeting which also changed
the game.

204
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,089
They also did pop-ups.

205
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,790
Unfortunately, Google came around about three
years later and crushed them.

206
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,040
And, for a number of reasons, we won't talk
about it, and I don't even know all those

207
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,899
reasons, but this had a lasting effect on
the internet.

208
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:40,920
Later, this site would break up, become go.com,
and Baidu came out of this knowledge, and

209
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,190
it had a huge effect on the internet.

210
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,829
Search.

211
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:50,019
What did people do before search?

212
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,100
How did they find content?

213
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,829
Let's look.

214
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:55,279
It's stuff like this.

215
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,120
Directories, and portals.

216
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,529
All these links grouped together.

217
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,660
This was the original vision of the internet
- link the document content.

218
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,589
It was great because you could find things
that you were looking for and you had a quick

219
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:11,779
search type-thing but this is not the search
as we know it today.

220
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:16,259
You literally crawled the internet to find
what you were looking for.

221
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,589
People loved it, although, at the time, nobody
would put their credit card into this.

222
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:25,759
So the trust on the internet didn't come overnight.

223
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:33,139
So, is this little thing here, is this the
killer app for phones in 1992 when this was

224
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,139
around?

225
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,139
No.

226
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,649
Phones were the killer of the internet back
then.

227
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,529
You picked this thing up, and it would kill
whatever you were downloading at that time.

228
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,959
The phones and the internet didn't play together
in the early days.

229
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,160
A lot of that had to do with the trust.

230
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,411
There wasn't any trust established with how
you might transact on the internet.

231
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:54,050
It was a shared document for.

232
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,430
Why is that important?

233
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,910
Why is the shared document store even anything
worth talking about?

234
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,230
Let's go back one more step, last step.

235
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,319
This is Tim Berners-Lee.

236
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:09,810
This was his executive summary of the World
Wide Web.

237
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,810
He said this project was started with a philosophy
that as much academic information should be

238
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,209
freely available to anyone no matter where
they are in the world.

239
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:20,209
This is the idea.

240
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,640
He wasn't thinking about payments; he wasn't
thinking about discovery.

241
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,750
He was thinking that information should be
spread to everyone.

242
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,480
So, I think that, if we talk about what we
like about the internet, and how voice should

243
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,990
work on the internet, I really like this as
a kind of visionary piece.

244
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,800
Okay.

245
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,930
So now we've taken a brief history of the
internet, just random one, actually.

246
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,339
I'm supposed to propose a new protocol of
voice, right?

247
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,610
That's what I came here to do.

248
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,050
I would like to do that.

249
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,579
I'm going to do that but I need a moment to
talk about something first.

250
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:00,579
And that is trust.

251
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,481
So, if you will just trust me for a minute,
we're going to do some pictures, and we're

252
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:09,990
going to talk about how trust works on the
internet, or with technology in general.

253
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,040
Let's start with Tim Berners-Lee, 1991, no
internet.

254
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,420
In the early days, this was, this might have
been the computer that TBL himself was using.

255
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,670
It's six for us to understand and easy for
us to trust.

256
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,509
You see this brief case here with money?

257
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:31,600
This is a metaphor, and it what it relates
to is personal data.

258
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,250
I like to put money in data because it's intrinsically
linked.

259
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:46,120
Money isn't the only reason why you should
- let's say that money - let's start with

260
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
money.

261
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,379
If you have money, you want to protect it
in this brief case, so you need to put it

262
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:51,379
somewhere safe.

263
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:55,829
You can see there is this blue hazy cloud
around the brief case.

264
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,309
That blue hazy cloud represents trust.

265
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:02,310
Think time you have money, you need to trust
where it is, right?

266
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:10,079
We are going to use the blue cloud to talk
about how these different models work, right?

267
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,209
We had this computer, right?

268
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:17,379
You had your spreadsheet, your tax information,
maybe finance and bank records, and games.

269
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,800
But where would you get those games?

270
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,910
How would you install an app in this time?

271
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,360
Let's do another diagram.

272
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,529
So this is how we would do it: you would physically
I get in your car probably with your family,

273
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:36,860
you would go to a store, brick and mortar
app store, and you would purchase it, and

274
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,740
you would be very happy, and you would come
home.

275
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,829
You will notice that there is a trust cloud
around this store.

276
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:47,230
That's pretty important here because the software
you buy from them, you better had trust there,

277
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,490
right, because you're about to install it
on your computer.

278
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,639
However, the nice thing was, and the reason
we trusted it was because we knew how stores

279
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,119
worked, we understood that trust model, and
we got our computer and the software from

280
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:01,110
the same place, and we got our computer fixed
from the same place.

281
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:06,490
There was a little bit of conflict of interest
there, but we could trust that.

282
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,480
We thought they were experts, and all this
software that surfaced, we assumed that's

283
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,350
the software that was out there.

284
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,260
We didn't think there was stuff outside of
this.

285
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,029
This is easy for us to understand.

286
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:24,220
You notice, and this is something that is
pretty important, is, for both of these trust

287
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,610
clouds, you also have a choice.

288
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:32,899
You can choice to go to Micro Center or other
store, choose to use IBM, Apple, any number

289
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:35,620
of computers back in the day.

290
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,620
You had a choice.

291
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,270
Without this choice, there's really not trust.

292
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,970
The trust is an active thing, at least to
me.

293
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:48,040
If you talk about what trust is without choice,
it is more like hope, because you don't have

294
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
a choice.

295
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,789
Trust is you're choosing to trust the things
that you choose.

296
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,110
Okay.

297
00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:03,270
Well, I just - I love this picture because
it is like the feeling I had whenever I go

298
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,240
to Microsoft.

299
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,120
Or whenever I go to Micro Center.

300
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,470
I knew some cool stuff was happening.

301
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,520
So let's talk about the trust model for the
internet.

302
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,980
This is much more complex, right?

303
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,860
This is what Tim Berners-Lee had in mind.

304
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,000
You notice the first thing I want to talk
about - on the left here - calling it the

305
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,529
user agent, and it is your browser.

306
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:28,790
There's this whole new trust model that had
to form around the browser.

307
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,220
This is like your gatekeeper to the internet,
right?

308
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,720
It's what all the information flows through.

309
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,059
It is separate from the content.

310
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,110
It is not all grouped together like this.

311
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,860
We had to learn about what a browser is.

312
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,700
We had to learn how to trust our browsers,
and, then, on the other side of this, you

313
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,090
have a bunch of websites which are all constantly
under construction, constantly changing.

314
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,720
We had to learn to trust each of those individually
or not trust them.

315
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,799
We understand this now, right?

316
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,100
This is ten or 15 years later - 30 years later.

317
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,620
We understand.

318
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,390
We also had this middle part which we're not
going to talk about but it is pretty interesting.

319
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,929
You have like these dump trucks of information,
right?

320
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:09,610
That's the Information Superhighway, and,
in the middle, there is this magic.

321
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,990
There is complexity there, there is trust.

322
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:19,740
There are a lot of things to discuss: you
have the ISPs, backbones, government regulation.

323
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,679
But, for the normal everyday use of installing
or using content, you don't think about that,

324
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,679
right?

325
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:27,720
It's all hidden for you.

326
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,350
Your user agent brokers all that.

327
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,470
This is a really cool, this is a really cool
breakdown because you get trust, so many granular

328
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,559
choices of trust, and then this user agent
over here, it doesn't care what content you

329
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,559
see.

330
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,260
It just wants to make sure what you see that
content that you have a good experience while

331
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
doing it.

332
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,240
This is a disinterested third-party in what
you're doing or using this platform for.

333
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,330
This is pretty important to how trust works
on the internet.

334
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,140
Let's work on the app store model.

335
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,570
Here's the Apple app store.

336
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:08,919
And despite the fact that we put this in jail,
so we're trying to lead a little bit, users

337
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,779
actually love this model because you have
a single source of trust.

338
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,230
You just use this software, this phone, this
app store, and everything is kind of taken

339
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,250
care for you, right?

340
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,740
Of course, there are bad parts about being
locked in.

341
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,870
The developers there, you have to make sure
that you're part of this ecosystem, but users

342
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,870
love this.

343
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,840
This is a very popular successful model.

344
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,170
But it is not the way things have to work.

345
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,710
Okay.

346
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,510
Promised to talk about voice, didn't I?

347
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,799
Let's talk about voice.

348
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,870
We don't really is have an established trust
models around voice yet.

349
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,990
We need to.

350
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:55,149
We are starting to formulate one, and it's
looking a lot more like the app store model,

351
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:56,520
and it's looking like the internet.

352
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,769
It is because it's much easier to trust the
product you buy into your house but look at

353
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,450
all these new data types.

354
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:09,130
Like, you have your speech, you have the type
of music you listen to, you have control over

355
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,700
your house, and data about your house - your
locks, lights, your habits.

356
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,520
You have your ambient noise.

357
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,510
All sorts of stuff here that is really a little
bit scary, but you have to choose to trust

358
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,980
all of it or nothing.

359
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,560
That's where it is right now.

360
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,760
That's kind of just the tip of the iceberg.

361
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,740
There are all these processes that go on underneath
from the people who own these platforms that

362
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,360
we don't know about, right?

363
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,269
I'm a big fan of Google, Amazon, and Apple
- I use their products all the time - but

364
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:44,940
it is always good to be a little bit sceptical
about what we are using and try to understand

365
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,809
how could this data be used?

366
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:52,039
How might they be using this data?

367
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,799
Okay.

368
00:21:53,799 --> 00:22:02,559
So, I promised to propose a new API for the
web.

369
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,860
But you've probably seen by now we've talked
mostly about trust more than the web, more

370
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,299
than any sort of technology.

371
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:15,559
We're going to continue that but I'm going
to propose a new protocol.

372
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,120
It might not be what you think.

373
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,520
Okay, so, VoiceHTML: I said in my pitch a
new protocol for how voice assistance could

374
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,620
interact with websites.

375
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,570
I had better propose this right.

376
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,590
Any time you introduce a new protocol on the
internet, you can't do it really fast, right?

377
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,240
I could go and have the best protocol right
now, but if there is no consensus around it,

378
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
nobody's going to use it.

379
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,669
You have to break it down into phases, and
I've broken it down into four phases for you

380
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:45,669
all.

381
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:49,100
Bear with me as we go through this.

382
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,260
Phase 1, central screenreader day.

383
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,570
What if, for once a year, all you could use
the internet was using a screenreader, right?

384
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:04,780
We could get all the top browsers come together
and decide on a certain day, you can't use

385
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,890
the internet except through a screenreader.

386
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,640
[Single whoop from the audience.].

387
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,120
There are a couple of reasons we want to do
this.

388
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
I'm actually not a browser vendor.

389
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,500
I don't represent Mozilla, so I hope - I mean,
I do represent them, but I don't talk about

390
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,640
Firefox, I talk about voice, so I can't do
this myself.

391
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,669
We have to do this together.

392
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:31,230
The benefits here are more than getting voice
better on the internet.

393
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,440
We have more empathy from users than developers.

394
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,860
People will understand what it's like to use
the web without these great kind of cool interactive

395
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,550
experiences that are visual interactive experiences,
and then immediately, you will have better

396
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,550
accessibility.

397
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:50,350
What if we chose black Friday to have International
Screen Reader day?

398
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:55,769
People will make their sites super accessible
overnight.

399
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:56,850
Let's do it.

400
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,730
Any of you who are browser vendors, talk to
me.

401
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,669
Step two, souped up screenreaders.

402
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:06,930
We're not going to be able to take it.

403
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,600
It's going to be too difficult for most of
us.

404
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,920
We are going to have to add some functionality
to the screenreaders for this one day to make

405
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,550
sure we can use the internet before and be
at least somewhat productive.

406
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,590
Where to start?

407
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:27,940
We surveyed Amazon, Echo and Alexa users and
home users, and said what are the features

408
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,140
of the product that you would really like
to use?

409
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,679
I think that would be a great start for screenreaders.

410
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,769
You could do email better, if you could discover
new features and skills; if you could read

411
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,919
and summarise news and order food.

412
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,840
These are internet can already do a lot of
this stuff, right?

413
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,340
We have to make screenreaders have a better
experience.

414
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,039
What convenient readers need to do is - what
screenreaders need to do is track a little

415
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,680
bit of state about you and needs to be ostensible.

416
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:03,529
Then we can rely on everyone to expend, to
build a really great experience in an open

417
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:04,950
way.

418
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,380
Okay.

419
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,460
Step three: Robbie the Reader.

420
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,110
Robbie is your friend.

421
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,460
Robbie knows everything about you.

422
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,169
He knows that you like using Go Euro for train
trips.

423
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:20,029
He knows that you're tracking Olympic figure
skating.

424
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:26,279
He lives within your phone and speakers, and
he's always there for you.

425
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,820
He's like your mission control, or the person
in the chair who is always by the internet

426
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,919
for you.

427
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:33,659
He's like a co-pilot in life who can use the
internet.

428
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:39,550
There are a couple of things here that are
aspirational, like a conversational interface,

429
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,880
some sort of roaming profile that has your
data that you can still trust, a semantic

430
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,350
understanding of the web, and no knowledge
of how to use websites, right?

431
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,350
So this is interesting.

432
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:55,440
Like, instead of an API that Robbie is interacting
with, the browser is the API.

433
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,669
He's using the browser for you.

434
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:01,260
Most importantly, he has your trust.

435
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,309
Without trust, you're not going to be doing
any of the transacting you want to do on the

436
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:10,250
internet with Robbie you need that trust,
right?

437
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,620
Final step: disappointment.

438
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,890
This is not going to work for a number of
reasons.

439
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:23,070
Screenreaders are for reading screens, not
for adding some kind of personal voice assistant.

440
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,899
Natural language understanding, conversational
interfaces, they're still very, very hard.

441
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:30,789
We're getting there, but it's years out.

442
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,029
Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, those are
still hard.

443
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:37,010
That's why you only have a couple of of players
in this space.

444
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:42,470
Semantic understanding of the web, this is
moving really fast, in academia, but we're

445
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,580
still far away, and we didn't even talk about
monetisation apps, so it's going to be hard

446
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,600
to do Robbie - Robbie the Reader.

447
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,200
The point of this is that we don't actually
need any new protocols for the web.

448
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,279
Web has some great APIs already.

449
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,710
You have aria and the accessibility tree.

450
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,169
It will be great for semantic understanding.

451
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:07,380
We have the web speech API, speech synthesis
so it can understand your voice and talk back

452
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,490
to you.

453
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:16,560
We have real time communication channels like
web sockets, and you have JavaScript, tying

454
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
it all together.

455
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,510
You really have a platform we need top we
have so many things figured out.

456
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:28,950
So let's go back to our model of the internet.

457
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,389
This took us years and years before we trusted
this.

458
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:37,429
We learned to like this, because we learned
about choice.

459
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:44,559
This is still a prevailing model, despite
the success of app stores.

460
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,200
Can we bring a similar model to the internet?

461
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,770
The biggest change here is you see just on
the left, we have a house instead of your

462
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,179
computer, so there's a little bit more types
of data that are stored inside there, right?

463
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:02,750
Then you have this little speaker which is
a user agent for you.

464
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,000
So right now, they're not user agent where
they're vendor agents.

465
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,450
You buy a product, a voice product, as a representative
of that company.

466
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,309
Your browser actually represents you.

467
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:17,940
It is supposed to be completely independent
of the content you get from it, so we need

468
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,789
this sort of trust model and voice.

469
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:26,400
The protocol that I'm proposing here is not
about technology, it's about how we understand

470
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,630
our products, and how we use our products,
and, really, what I'm doing here today is

471
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:36,580
I want to propose a question or a problem,
and I want your help on it.

472
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,299
That's why I did this click bait title because
I wanted people who are architects of the

473
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,669
internet to talk to us about it.

474
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:49,289
We don't know the answer to this, and we're
trying to work it out right now.

475
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:55,889
The last thing that I had promised to do was
compare screenreaders versus voice HTML and

476
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:58,889
booking a flight.

477
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:04,490
VoiceHTML is vapourware, no libraries to compare
with.

478
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,070
No matter how difficult it is to book a flight
with a screenreader, and, trust me, it is

479
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:16,570
very difficult, but it beats HTML because
it works today.

480
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:22,559
I thought it might be interesting instead
to compare what we have today versus what

481
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,600
it was like before the internet.

482
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,000
How did we book flights before the internet?

483
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
How?

484
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,470
I didn't know.

485
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,549
I had to ask somebody.

486
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:35,009
I asked my dad!

487
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,009
[Laughter].

488
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:42,549
Dad said, "I would call a travel agent, and
he was paid by the hotel or airline as a percentage

489
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:43,549
of costs."

490
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,330
That's a conflict of interest, right?

491
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,639
So he would shop around.

492
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:51,400
He would look for travel agents that were
trustworthy in general.

493
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,150
I wasn't even asking about trust.

494
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,440
He brought up trust himself.

495
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,130
Trust is always embedded in the things we
do.

496
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,309
You notice there is something interesting,
this built-in conflict of interest.

497
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:08,840
These travel agents didn't represent him,
they represented the airline or hotel.

498
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,519
This was a vendor agent, right?

499
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:19,220
We have mechanisms in place where we can beat
that model, I think.

500
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,470
Okay.

501
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:30,490
So, that's what I wanted to propose: how can
we make a better future for how we might interact

502
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,259
with these products of the future?

503
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,750
Final thoughts: trust is hard, right?

504
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,139
But it's important.

505
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:40,250
It's what made the web successful, it's what
made app stores successful, and it is what

506
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,620
makes technology successful.

507
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,820
The web I don't think needs any new APIs for
voice - not yet.

508
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,669
Maybe it will as we go along.

509
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:57,000
Maybe we could extend Aria to add interaction
stuff, maybe add some new APIs for open graph

510
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,700
met at that tags to announce this is a vote-enabled
site and you can find it on search engines.

511
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,200
We can talk about that but I don't think it's
the most pressing topic right now.

512
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,340
What we need, what voice needs, is a new trust
model that is like the web.

513
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,179
We need that user agent.

514
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:21,820
So, to wrap up, my question to you, and what
I would love help with, is how are we going

515
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,080
to do this?

516
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,580
How are we going to change our models for
how we interact with these voice products?

517
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,379
We are the architects of the internet.

518
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:31,289
We kind of move the direction.

519
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,399
We have a lot of power in how these things
work.

520
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:35,380
So how can we do it?

521
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,640
I really don't know.

522
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,870
If you have thoughts, and ideas about any
of this trust, reach out to me.

523
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,200
This is my act information.

524
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,230
Also, this is our common voice project, so
you can donate your voice right now.

525
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:55,879
This will be a public data set, completely
public domain.

526
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:59,580
We make that promise to you so everything
you do is benefitting the public good.

527
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,780
Come and check out our website.

528
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,419
The team, we have a blog, Medium blog.

529
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:12,000
We talk about diversity and inclusion, open
practices, we talk about voice.

530
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,240
So all of those things are there.

531
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,769
But thank you.
