00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,330

thank you very much so as Marcy said I'm

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,339
Erin and I'm a web standards and

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,639
accessibility advocate at Microsoft some

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,130
of you who've been around for a bit

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,049
probably know me from my work at a list

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,089
apart I'm currently editor-in-chief

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,940
there I also was a manager of the web

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,210
standards project back in the day but

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,199
today I want to talk about something

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,730
that's kind of near and dear to my heart

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,019
that I'm getting more and more excited

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,920
about so chat BOTS and digital

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,449
assistants are kind of becoming all the

14
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,390
rage now and most of these if you aren't

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,700
aware work from specially coded data

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,190
sets and models but there's more than

17
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,770
four and a half billion pages of content

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,200
stored online trapped in many cases

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,850
within our websites articles stories

20
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,489
blog posts educational materials books

21
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,890
and marketing messages all on the web

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,649
but for the most part an untapped

23
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,480
treasure trove of content that could be

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,649
useful in a non-visual context now there

25
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,300
have been a few projects search engine

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,369
spiders probably most notably that are

27
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,020
working to turn that often unstructured

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,650
mess into something usable right but we

29
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,930
can do more a lot more to enable our

30
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,450
pages to be usable both by real people

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,360
and the computers that power voice based

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,479
user experiences and that's what I'm

33
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,549
here to talk about I want to release

34
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,400
that content from the screen and empower

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,409
it to go anywhere and everywhere I want

36
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:29,579
it to find its way into virtual

37
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,049
assistants and other voice response

38
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,090
technologies and even into voiceless

39
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,299
chat BOTS without requiring us to code

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,240
and recode over and over again into

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,570
multiple redundant formats I also have a

42
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,460
dream of enabling our users to actively

43
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,890
engage with our content by filling in

44
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,439
forms or manipulating widgets just with

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,630
their voice and this sort of stuff is

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,380
becoming possible specifically I'm here

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,110
to talk to you about how we can use HTML

48
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,810
and Aria to make our content structured

49
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,180
sensible and most importantly meaningful

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,310
and it all begins with the humble

51
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,479
element so consider this M element sure

52
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,480
it's visibly rendered as italics but it

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,680
also adds emphasis

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,200
to the content within hTML is just

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,659
chock-full of elements like this that

56
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,510
convey meaning nuance and relationships

57
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,670
and being aware of these enables us to

58
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,950
author more expressive documents and

59
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,140
ignoring them can actually undermine the

60
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,640
usability of the content that we're

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,430
marking up when we create a webpage we

62
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,170
need to be mindful of the conversation

63
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,030
that we're creating with our customers

64
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,909
in that process and we need to choose

65
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,459
the elements that we use with intent and

66
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,810
care one of the best indicators of how

67
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,340
HTML will make it into our Virtual

68
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,049
Assistants is another assistive

69
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,629
technology screen readers write not only

70
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,859
do screen readers do as their name

71
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:55,049
implies but they also enable users to

72
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,650
rapidly navigate a page in various ways

73
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,329
and they provide means to translate

74
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:01,859
visual design constructs such as

75
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,650
proximity proportion and so on into

76
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,829
audible cues at least they do so when we

77
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,400
author our pages thoughtfully so that

78
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,349
further ado let's jump into some solid

79
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,180
examples of how we can create more

80
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,129
meaningful documents and empower them to

81
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,209
be more usable in a headless UI context

82
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:22,199
we'll start by looking at what are

83
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,629
called phrasing elements the emphasis

84
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:26,370
you saw earlier was an example of this

85
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,220
and we used to call them inline elements

86
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,229
because by default they're visibly

87
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:34,019
inline text but phrasing is more

88
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,909
accurate as a description because well

89
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:39,930
they mark up phrases right so we saw

90
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,909
this example earlier here the word

91
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:44,939
really is marked up as emphasized now

92
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:47,819
when spoken by a virtual assistant heads

93
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,560
up none of them quite do this yet but

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,060
I've mocked it up with the speech

95
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,040
synthesis API in JavaScript it could

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,269
sound something like this

97
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,259
I'm really happy to see you which is

98
00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:59,419
kind of cool

99
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:02,040
now sometimes emphasis is not enough

100
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,319
when we want to indicate that content is

101
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,090
very important for our customers to pay

102
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,040
attention to the strong element is the

103
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,720
right way to go because strong means

104
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,500
that something is of strong importance

105
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,810
now visibly M and strong are displayed

106
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,780
as italics and bold respectively and in

107
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,370
the early days of the web when I first

108
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,219
started out we had the I and B element

109
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:25,200
which were rendered exactly the same and

110
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,880
so many of us just thought they were

111
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,480
interchange

112
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,090
Abell and with B&I being shorted or

113
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,270
right they proliferated on the web

114
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,440
semantically however these elements are

115
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,170
quite different from their doppelgangers

116
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,730
the AI element is similar to the

117
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,170
emphasis element but it's a bit more

118
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,330
generic it's used to indicate an

119
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,700
alternate voice or mood it could be used

120
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,160
to indicate sarcasm or idiomatic remarks

121
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,740
or shifts in language so it's a terrible

122
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,720
movie and it made 200 million go figure

123
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,730
right now in the second example here you

124
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,870
might notice that I've indicated a

125
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,730
language being shifted too from the

126
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,800
natural language of the document this

127
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,630
indicator is a simple mechanism that

128
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,640
could inform a voice synthesizer to

129
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,340
shift pronunciation here's an example of

130
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,330
how that might work

131
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,550
she has admired for her energy and is

132
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,600
whether the Yvonne not perfect but we

133
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,340
only have a couple of things that we can

134
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,840
work with a couple different voices we

135
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,160
can work with in speech synthesis right

136
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,230
now but it kind of points at what's

137
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,520
possible the B element is used for

138
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,830
content that should be set apart or in

139
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,660
the parlance of the spec stylistically

140
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,180
off set but it's of no greater

141
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,610
importance than the surrounding text so

142
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,080
I like to use it for the names of people

143
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,120
or the names of products things that

144
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,680
would be like keywords within the

145
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,780
content that I might want to mark up in

146
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,820
some certain way or might want to

147
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,120
visually call out in some certain way

148
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,620
books films and and things like that

149
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,390
have their own element the site element

150
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,460
which will see an example of shortly and

151
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,920
functionally the B element is a lot like

152
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,140
a span which is for generic phrasing

153
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,270
content but with a shorter tag now HTML

154
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,650
has other specialized phrasing

155
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,960
constructs - such as a abbr for

156
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,850
abbreviations and acronyms so in this

157
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,040
case hTML is the standard markup

158
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,510
language for creating web pages and web

159
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,680
applications and here I've given a title

160
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,210
for hypertext markup language which is

161
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,250
what HTML is an abbreviation for or an

162
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,190
acronym for rather now sadly as with

163
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,690
many things on the web

164
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,020
black hat SEO folks used the title

165
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,480
element - or the title attribute to put

166
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,610
all kinds of awful stuff into pages in

167
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,890
order to boost search engine ranking so

168
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,660
that basically spurned screen readers to

169
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,580
stop reading it because this will give

170
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,410
you a sense of the time people just kept

171
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,200
putting panel and

172
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,560
name in there over and over again visual

173
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,870
browsers still do provide tooltips so

174
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,000
there is some utility to the title

175
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,370
attribute they're not completely useless

176
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,690
but screen readers don't pay attention

177
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,480
to it and it's pretty unlikely that they

178
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,780
will be surfaced by a virtual assistant

179
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,730
to be honest it's probably best unless

180
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,170
you want that tooltip to just avoid

181
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,890
using title altogether for the purposes

182
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,780
of absolute clarity in our content you

183
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,610
should introduce and explain important

184
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,170
abbreviations and acronyms the first

185
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,150
time they're used and there isn't

186
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,440
there's even an element that actually

187
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,660
signals that defining context the dfn

188
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,880
element so in this case hypertext markup

189
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,220
language and then in parentheses hTML is

190
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,840
the standard markup language for

191
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,490
creating web pages and web applications

192
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,900
finally there's the span element which

193
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,580
is used for generic phrases it's a

194
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,990
meaningless element so it wouldn't be

195
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,240
spoken in any other way differently by

196
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,530
default there are a bunch of other ones

197
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,120
but I only have so much time that I can

198
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,220
talk to y'all so I'm gonna try and keep

199
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,970
it a keep it brief here links are also

200
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,620
phrasing elements but I want to call

201
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,420
them out specifically because they're a

202
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,370
much richer interface and provide a lot

203
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,710
more opportunity for fine-tuning how our

204
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,620
users interact with them the primary way

205
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,810
we use links of course is to link to

206
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,390
related content right and it's important

207
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,590
when we do this to actually choose

208
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,690
meaningful words and phrases as our link

209
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,720
text because when assistive technologies

210
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,080
hit click here or read more that doesn't

211
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,250
tell them anything about what it is that

212
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,010
they're actually accessing all right

213
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,210
those are not useful especially if

214
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,430
there's several on the page and when

215
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,770
people skim via those links which I'll

216
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,050
talk a little bit about shortly that

217
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,510
gets really painful so in this case I

218
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,370
wrote the book adaptive web design and

219
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,440
I've got it in a site element as well as

220
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,350
an anchor so that's a pretty good

221
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,410
example of that instead of saying I

222
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,240
wrote the book adaptive web design click

223
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,930
here to learn more about it right we can

224
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,760
also use links and I think that we

225
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,140
should do this more frequently to

226
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,760
reference content within the current

227
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,070
document or even it specifically

228
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,110
identified places within the document so

229
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,480
if you if you are referencing a table or

230
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,800
a figure of some sort

231
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,380
give that figure an ID so that it can

232
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,950
actually be linked to from

233
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,960
than the content of your pages same

234
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,940
thing for headings please God if you're

235
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,800
writing something on the web put IDs on

236
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,150
your headings so that if I want to

237
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,770
reference something that you've written

238
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,660
I can actually point to at least the

239
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,640
section that it's in don't make me just

240
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,930
go to the generic page and have somebody

241
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,350
have to hunt for where that quote is you

242
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,050
can even use them to inform users about

243
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,140
the language that's in use on a linked

244
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,560
page using the href Lang attribute so in

245
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,080
this case it's switching to a Spanish

246
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,230
version of this page and you can

247
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,730
indicate the kind of content being

248
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,740
linked to using the type attribute use

249
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,520
mime types for that and in a relatively

250
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,680
new addition to the HTML spec you

251
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,600
actually have the download keyword which

252
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,280
can inform the browser that the file in

253
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,660
question should be downloaded rather

254
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,850
than presented again it's a simple

255
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,650
attribute that makes an HTML document

256
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,620
capable of so much more it's worth

257
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,210
noting though for the download attribute

258
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,680
that would be ignored on any

259
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,170
cross-origin you are eyes so it has to

260
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,680
be same domain anchor elements also

261
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,010
support non web pseudo protocols to the

262
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,820
most common or mailto and tell so email

263
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,220
and phone numbers but SMS and web quel

264
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,950
are also quite quite common and some

265
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,690
operating systems and browsers allow

266
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,450
installed apps to also register custom

267
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,000
protocols that serve to access in-app

268
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,980
functionality but I want to just throw

269
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,090
it out there that you should be cautious

270
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,280
about using that approach because if the

271
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,980
protocol is not recognized then the

272
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,720
operating system will often prompt the

273
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,670
user to try and find an app that can

274
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,010
actually use that which just adds

275
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,530
friction to the experience there are

276
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,870
other ways to direct URLs into

277
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,060
applications so I recommend looking into

278
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,600
those now all this phrasing contents

279
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,250
great but I've spent a little while in

280
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,740
the weeds the minutia and I want to kind

281
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,690
of pull back and look at documents

282
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,490
themselves because I need to I think we

283
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,110
need to think about how we author are

284
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,030
our documents and our web pages on the

285
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,330
whole now as you're probably aware

286
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,310
headless you eyes place a greater

287
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,980
cognitive load on our users it's hard to

288
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,210
keep track of where you are in an

289
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,920
interface and it can be even more

290
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,510
challenging to move around when you

291
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,340
can't gather information about the

292
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,520
interface from visual

293
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,950
and the more complex and interfaces the

294
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,020
more challenging this becomes now the

295
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,880
same is true in visual interfaces too

296
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,440
which is why mobile first was such a

297
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,960
great boon for us because it told us we

298
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,940
needed to focus our pages on on single

299
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,680
tasks and helping users to accomplish

300
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,470
those things it reduced the noise and

301
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,080
raised the signal but most webpages I

302
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,670
think you'd probably agree are the

303
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,560
antithesis of clear and straightforward

304
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,500
as our screen sizes enlarge we just keep

305
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,100
shoving stuff into that space sharing

306
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,950
links related content cross promotions

307
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,990
and so on sometimes it's easy to lose

308
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,270
sight of what is actually the content of

309
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,050
the page to combat this screen readers

310
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,820
provide numerous mechanisms that enable

311
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,320
users to gather information about the

312
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,790
current interface and then move

313
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,520
efficiently through it to find the bit

314
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,780
that's most relevant to them in the

315
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,550
current moment so one mechanism

316
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,440
available for skimming a document

317
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,750
involves moving the focus caret from one

318
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,850
interactive element to another now

319
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,530
traditionally that movements done via

320
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,750
the keyboard via the tab key but it can

321
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,000
also be done via voice by saying next or

322
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,960
previous or similar commands now in most

323
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,700
documents this means moving from link to

324
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,710
link which are shown here in green and

325
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,630
supporting skimming in this way makes

326
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,490
the the text that we choose for links

327
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,680
even more critical in ensuring that our

328
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,410
users get a good experience for Mela

329
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,810
mints and buttons are also focusable and

330
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,100
I'll talk a little bit more about forms

331
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,070
towards the end of the session now you

332
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,020
can add elements that would not

333
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,150
traditionally be focusable into the tab

334
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,330
order by adding a tabindex attribute

335
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,580
with a value of zero that's very

336
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,200
important to only do zero or negative

337
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,440
one never go over zero but this ensures

338
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,330
that critical interface components are

339
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,550
not accidentally bypassed by users who

340
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,400
are using tabbing to move through an

341
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,589
interface and incidentally it also

342
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:03,020
enables sighted users to interact and

343
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,170
scroll elements via the keyboard so if

344
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,360
you have a scrollable div or something

345
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,830
like that somebody who's using a

346
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,420
keyboard can actually scroll that even

347
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,900
if they're sighted now another

348
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,760
navigational mechanism is browsing by

349
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,680
heading the various heading levels in

350
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,839
HTML create a natural document outline

351
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,880
and assistive technologies can enable

352
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,740
users to skim content using these

353
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,230
headings since only the contents of the

354
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,880
heading elements are read out loud in

355
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,920
this mode I highly recommend that you

356
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,290
avoid using cutesy marketing phrases and

357
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,670
stick to just summarizing what the

358
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,240
contents are of each section and then

359
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,440
the final way users can traverse

360
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,000
documents is via what are called

361
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,610
landmarks so the concept of landmarks

362
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,410
surfaced in the development of the Aria

363
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,750
spec and the idea is that you could use

364
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,910
the the role attribute to define

365
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,800
specific regions of the page based on

366
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,280
their function now in the example I have

367
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,720
up on the screen here the author is

368
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,310
isolating their navigation in a div

369
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,459
element with our ID of nav now that

370
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,709
might be meaningful to us as front end

371
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,959
designers and developers because we we

372
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,330
know that nav means navigation but it's

373
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,310
not exposed to assistive technology as

374
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,610
navigation when we explicitly add a roll

375
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,150
of navigation to that div however that

376
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,339
function gets made explicit to assistive

377
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,250
technology and there are a ton of roles

378
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,540
one out of time there's a there's a

379
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,700
handful of roles that are landmarks and

380
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,650
I'm going to show you a couple of these

381
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,650
in action if you have not checked it out

382
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,780
24 ways I think it's twenty four ways

383
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,350
org

384
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,060
twenty four ways to impress your friends

385
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,680
it's an advent calendar for web

386
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,810
professionals and it's a magazine but

387
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,970
it's highly interactive and it's very

388
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,860
accessible and they actually use

389
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,630
landmarks to identify all of the key

390
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,380
areas of a page such as the primary

391
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,010
header or the banner of a site the main

392
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,400
content of their site the content

393
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,160
concerned with easing navigation through

394
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,200
the site and information about the

395
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,030
content such as copyright designations

396
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:06,140
and here's how users in a non visual

397
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,630
context can actually experience that may

398
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,380
unlock 2015 heading level long

399
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,790
navigation I'm not browse 24 based

400
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,810
heading level 1 Sun factor 24 ways

401
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,339
content info not copyright 2005 2006 T

402
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:23,810
so landmarks also give users the

403
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,490
opportunity to jump directly to a

404
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,079
location with an interface which is

405
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:30,110
incredibly helpful in a voice context a

406
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,940
user might be able to ask the assistant

407
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,339
to read me the navigation for this pay

408
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:37,370
or search for way baby wooden baby toys

409
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,110
and the assistant could use these

410
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,360
landmarks to quickly respond to those

411
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,759
commands all without any additional

412
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,610
programming now it's worth noting that

413
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,430
many of these roles these landmark roles

414
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,139
have equivalent HTML tags and that's

415
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:53,269
because html5 and Aria were being

416
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:55,160
developed at the same time and sought to

417
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,230
to solve some of the same issues and

418
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,740
limitations of the web at the time so

419
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,930
banner is automatically assigned to the

420
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,699
first header element that you use that's

421
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,889
not contained inside of a sectioning

422
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:09,350
element navigation is automatically

423
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,930
assigned to nav main is automatically

424
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,880
assigned to main complementary is

425
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,730
assigned to aside elements and content

426
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,380
info is assigned to the first footer

427
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,240
that is not inside of a sectioning

428
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,680
element one last bit I want to touch on

429
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,750
before I discussed forums is the div

430
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,079
element we often see divs employed in

431
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,269
web pages when designers want to group

432
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:34,670
related elements together or they just

433
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,440
don't like the natives excuse me the

434
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,329
native styling of a particular control

435
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:42,350
like a button now organizing content

436
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,019
using divs is okay but divs are

437
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,579
meaningless elements and they add

438
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:48,410
nothing to the interface in terms of

439
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,439
context by contrast there are many

440
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:53,360
organizational elements that do add a

441
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,110
ton of context for our users things like

442
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,079
paragraphs things like lists description

443
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,810
lists which are vastly underused figures

444
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,909
Figg captions and then in terms of

445
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:06,709
grander stuff we've got articles

446
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,510
sections headers and footers which I've

447
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,380
mentioned nav and aside there are a ton

448
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,970
of meaningful elements out there that

449
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,100
can enable our assistants to do more for

450
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,130
our customers and the more we use them

451
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,380
the more useful our assistants become

452
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,500
and the more powerful our users feel for

453
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,120
instance using article and heading

454
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,860
elements can actually enable voice

455
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,720
commands like readme all the news

456
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,220
headlines on the front page of the New

457
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,230
York Times without involving any sort of

458
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,990
specialized data feed the generic div

459
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,650
gets you none of these benefits as you

460
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,799
see HTML has a lot to offer in terms of

461
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,540
enabling our interfaces to operate

462
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,190
effectively in the world of headless

463
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,350
UI's beyond just content

464
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,390
though it has the capacity to streamline

465
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,190
interactivity such as the kind we see in

466
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,530
forms now forms can be a bit of a

467
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,600
necessary evil we need them in order to

468
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,160
gather information in the service of our

469
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,260
users but often they're poorly planned

470
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,049
and even more poorly executed which

471
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,880
leads to poor user experience for all of

472
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,799
our users regardless of how they're

473
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,410
interacting with that form thankfully

474
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,990
HTML has our backs thereto enabling us

475
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,660
to make necessary Corrections or

476
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,100
necessary connections in order to

477
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,500
clarify the purpose of a forum and

478
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,570
expedite the completion process but

479
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,830
let's start with something simple field

480
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,710
labels so while it can be seemed

481
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,780
perfectly reasonable to mark up form

482
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,640
fields like this with text and then an

483
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,010
input below it there's no Association of

484
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,080
the question what's your first name with

485
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,870
the text field that follows to create

486
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,000
that Association you need to use a label

487
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,039
element that will ensure the label can

488
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:42,080
be read by assistive technology when the

489
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,030
field is focused and labels can be

490
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,130
associated in one of two ways either

491
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,809
explicitly or implicitly so explicit

492
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:52,700
relies on using the for attribute which

493
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,919
is an ID reference to the field that's

494
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,590
associated with it with it so you see

495
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,500
the foreign ID there in teal and they

496
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,020
need to match implicit Association

497
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,460
relies on the label element actually

498
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,700
containing both the label text and the

499
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,539
field itself you can combine these two

500
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:14,330
approaches but generally explicit

501
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,890
Association is the simplest and clearest

502
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,510
choice for most interfaces now once you

503
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,460
have a good label it's time to turn your

504
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,830
attention to the field itself and the

505
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,020
type of field that we're using there are

506
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,940
a bunch of options available in HTML now

507
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,230
and it's important to choose the right

508
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,870
one for each job so if you're just

509
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,520
looking for a simple response from a

510
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,650
user the text field or you could even

511
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,539
leave off the type if you want to

512
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:40,600
because text is the default input type

513
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,940
that's gonna be your go-to but if you're

514
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,500
asking for somebody's email address

515
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,510
there's a specific field type for that

516
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,640
it looks like a text field in terms of

517
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,860
its visual display but browsers that

518
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,289
understand type equals email can also

519
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:56,210
validate that field for you

520
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,799
automatically without involving any

521
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:01,309
JavaScript but if a browser doesn't

522
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,200
understand the age

523
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,680
Millfield type of email that's okay the

524
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,480
field will simply revert to being a text

525
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,150
field and you can and and should still

526
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,740
be validating to see if it's a valid

527
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,120
email address either on the client side

528
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,310
or the server side we'll discuss that

529
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,890
stephannie in a moment but this is a

530
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,090
perfect example of progressive

531
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,200
enhancement which is a topic that's

532
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,120
quite near and dear to my heart so much

533
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,430
so that I've I've written two books now

534
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,530
on progressive enhancement both called

535
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,780
adaptive web design the first edition is

536
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,850
actually free to read online it is

537
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,380
available as a progressive web app so

538
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,400
you can even install it to your home

539
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,050
screen if you want to read it over time

540
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,760
and then the second edition just came

541
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,180
out relatively recently but back to

542
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,390
inputs so we have the email we also have

543
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,040
the input type URL this is another

544
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,690
common one that we often have to do

545
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,900
especially in social contexts and as

546
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,300
with the email field type browsers can

547
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,740
handle validation for you on this

548
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,080
automatically which is pretty cool and

549
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,650
in both cases in both of those instances

550
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,910
visual browsers that have a virtual

551
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,920
keyboard can actually provide a

552
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,870
specialized keyboard that can enable

553
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,540
sighted users to more quickly enter that

554
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,550
information there are a ton of other

555
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,750
field types I could talk about but

556
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,070
there's again there's only so much time

557
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,750
here and there's a lot more I want to

558
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,620
cover so UX design is concerned with

559
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,870
reducing friction of accomplishing tasks

560
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,150
right so as such we should look for

561
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,830
every opportunity to do that in our

562
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,920
forms so consider this form construct

563
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,600
which is asking for a u.s. phone number

564
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,120
if this is a fairly common thing instead

565
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,190
of a single field enabling a user to

566
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,930
continuously type their phone number the

567
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,460
designers chose to break it apart into

568
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,580
three separate fields they probably did

569
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,620
this to ensure consistent number

570
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,690
formatting right to make sure that every

571
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,430
number came back in the same format but

572
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,910
really that's a back-end problem right

573
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,440
you want to sanitize that information

574
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,590
when you receive it from the customer

575
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,180
because going down this path the

576
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,560
designers have placed the burden on the

577
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,510
users rather than the developers and the

578
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,970
experience actually suffers for it sure

579
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,440
you can write some JavaScript that will

580
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,300
auto auto advance you from field to

581
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,840
field

582
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,610
but without JavaScript users have to do

583
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,650
it manually and even if there is

584
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,660
JavaScript available and they get that

585
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,340
enhancement it can limit the ability the

586
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,080
user's ability to edit one of these

587
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,650
fields if they make a mistake

588
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,730
furthermore when it comes to using this

589
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,340
interface via voice users are required

590
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,580
to supply three separate values not only

591
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,910
that each field then requires a label

592
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,140
most developers are only going to know

593
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,540
how to label one of those three the area

594
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,640
code and actual users would probably be

595
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,470
baffled if you ask them for their

596
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,820
central office code or line number for

597
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,290
all these reasons it just makes sense to

598
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,940
work with eight what HTML gives us

599
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,920
there's a field for telephone numbers

600
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,110
input type equals tell it doesn't

601
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,940
validate because there are too many

602
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,940
international phone number formats but

603
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,630
that's okay it's inconsequential for us

604
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,970
to actually write the code to sanitize

605
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,650
and homogenized structured information

606
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,330
like phone numbers and Social Security

607
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,070
numbers and the like and honestly we

608
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,540
should be writing that code anyway

609
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,990
because you can't trust the client even

610
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,690
if you enforce the structure and

611
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,040
inconsistent consistency with JavaScript

612
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,020
on the front end we can still end up

613
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,700
with bad data coming in to the back end

614
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
we'll come back to that idea in a moment

615
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,930
now forms can be incredibly frustrating

616
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,400
to fill out especially if they're

617
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,620
particularly long as designers were

618
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,690
tasked with reducing user frustration

619
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,270
and errors happen right it's a fact of

620
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,890
life but we can help our users avoid

621
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,670
errors by taking a few simple steps

622
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,980
first of all most browsers allow users

623
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,810
to store information to be auto filled

624
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,690
into forms some watch for common data to

625
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,070
be filled in and then prompt the user to

626
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,590
save it to be auto filled later some

627
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,450
even goes so far as to take the values

628
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,310
you enter along with the corresponding

629
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,070
name or ID attributes that are on that

630
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,960
field and they'll prompt you to fill in

631
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,300
that same information later on when they

632
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,150
encounter that same name or ID for this

633
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,440
reason it makes sense to turn

634
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,840
autocomplete off for any fields that

635
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,220
deal with sensitive information like

636
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,930
passport numbers credit cards and the

637
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,530
like it used to be that all we had was

638
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,230
on and off though and we've actually

639
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,390
been granted a bunch of new values that

640
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,190
allow us to get very granular about the

641
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,020
sort of information we're expecting to

642
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,660
be auto-completed into these fields and

643
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,360
there are a ton of tokens for doing this

644
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,560
I'm not going to get into all of these

645
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,500
but I will walk you through an example

646
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,210
here I've got a question is there a

647
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:28,700
mobile

648
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,350
we can reach you on regarding delivery

649
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,139
so in this case we're doing an

650
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,989
autocomplete of shipping mobile tell so

651
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:37,279
we've got three modifiers they were

652
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,690
asking for a telephone number that's

653
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,519
associated with shipping right a mobile

654
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,659
telephone number thus associated with

655
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:44,059
shipping so we've actually got some

656
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,269
direct connections between the label and

657
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:51,769
the autocomplete tokens we're using as

658
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:53,840
I'm sure you can imagine the sort of

659
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,639
affordance can do a ton to reduce the

660
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:57,320
friction of filling in forms and if

661
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,279
you're keen to learn more about these

662
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,009
autofill tokens Jason Grigsby who works

663
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:03,679
at cloud four down in Portland he wrote

664
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,619
a very lengthy piece about these on the

665
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:07,999
cloud floor blog so I highly recommend

666
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:12,289
checking that out so we can help users

667
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:14,299
fill out form fields more quickly but

668
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:16,730
what about everything else well first of

669
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,769
all we should always let users know when

670
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:21,080
a field is required a common approach is

671
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,389
to provide a visual indicator if not all

672
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,950
of the fields on the form are required

673
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,409
and obviously it would be best to avoid

674
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:29,809
the situation altogether and only have

675
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:31,580
required fields in the form then you

676
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,899
could simply introduce it saying all

677
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:35,929
fields are required regardless of the

678
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:38,389
way you go however the required

679
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,190
attribute should be used in order to

680
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,080
ensure modern browsers can't allow a

681
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,970
user to submit a form when the field is

682
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,460
empty and then you use the Aria required

683
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,230
attribute to actually inform assistive

684
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,590
technology that the field is required

685
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,460
unfortunately browsers don't map them

686
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,529
automatically you should also provide

687
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:57,200
helpful hints to users in order to help

688
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,809
them avoid issues before they encounter

689
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,970
them so here we're asking for a complex

690
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,159
pattern for a delta flight number with

691
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,340
DL followed by two or more numbers and

692
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,769
so I am giving a placeholder to indicate

693
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,600
the sort of content that I want and then

694
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,100
I have the pattern attribute which is

695
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,109
actually creating the regular expression

696
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:20,009
to validate against for the browser

697
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:22,789
round trips to the server expensive so

698
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,769
especially on flaky networks so we want

699
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:26,570
to help our users avoid these things by

700
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,309
doing validation in the browser as much

701
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:30,499
as we can and we can rely on these tools

702
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:33,409
in order to do that so it starts with

703
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:35,570
the required attribute so that we don't

704
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,249
have empty fields being submitted if we

705
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:39,499
need them and then it comes to choosing

706
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:41,389
the right field type as I mentioned so

707
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:42,440
that we get native valid

708
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,019
if we can and then we can fall back to

709
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,519
the pattern attribute if there's not an

710
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,360
native validation scheme and then

711
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,279
browsers that actually implement the

712
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,950
html5 validation algorithm will notify

713
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,289
users in line of fields that have errors

714
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:59,899
and so often they will highlight the

715
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:02,539
first error and then have the user work

716
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,889
on fixing that before it can be

717
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:06,679
submitted there is also the html5

718
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:08,600
validation algorithm on the JavaScript

719
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,190
end and you can take this stuff over on

720
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,590
your own and and manage that experience

721
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,169
for your users all by paying attention

722
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:18,049
to those attributes that have been

723
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:19,490
assigned even if the browser doesn't

724
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,159
understand html5 validation you can roll

725
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,870
your own JavaScript library to do it in

726
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,240
I don't know I did it in like a hundred

727
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,370
lines of code very very spaced out and

728
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:33,110
commented it's really simple and then

729
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,970
once you've got inline errors when

730
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:35,899
you're wanting to highlight those

731
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:38,120
yourself you want to mark them invalid

732
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,950
using the Aria invalid attributes so

733
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,269
assistive technology knows there's an

734
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:43,279
issue here and then the error message

735
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,320
can be associated using Aria described

736
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,750
by which is an ID reference much like

737
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,080
the four attribute and so you can see

738
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,379
that here in orange your email star

739
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:56,179
edits required invalid entry your email

740
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:58,909
address is required blank so that's

741
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:02,389
pretty helpful right eventually I

742
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,070
already described by will be replaced by

743
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,710
Aria error message in this context but

744
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,480
the supports not there yet so that's

745
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,789
something down the road now client-side

746
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,590
validation is great but there's no

747
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,600
substitute for doing some form of

748
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,610
server-side validation and there's a

749
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,570
good reason I'm going to tell you a

750
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,279
quick story because I know we're at time

751
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,799
here but back in 2001 when the original

752
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,480
Xbox was the game system to drool over

753
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,490
we as an industry put a lot of faith in

754
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,080
the browser and didn't realize how our

755
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,389
sites could be manipulated or hacked and

756
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:31,159
I remember an instance where a major

757
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:32,929
vulnerability was discovered in an

758
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:34,820
e-commerce site and involved this gaming

759
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,129
system and the infinite wisdom the

760
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:39,289
developer had actually put the price of

761
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:41,870
the Xbox in a hidden input and since it

762
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,669
was hidden no one could see it an

763
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:45,919
enterprising web designer could view

764
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,080
source and see it but these were the

765
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,000
days before browsers actually had tools

766
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,679
for web developers to manipulate

767
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,369
documents in in real time but they did

768
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,179
have this thing called

769
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,090
save so you could save a web page for

770
00:28:59,090 --> 00:28:59,929
offline viewing

771
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:02,240
so one enterprising person did that very

772
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,940
thing edited the file and change that

773
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,299
value to a dollar and then they loaded

774
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:09,559
the HTML document in their browser

775
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,809
submitted the form and they got their

776
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:14,230
xbox about two weeks later for a buck

777
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,700
the developer didn't have any checks in

778
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,649
place to make sure that products

779
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:19,970
couldn't be sold for less than the e

780
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,600
value that they listed as the price they

781
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,889
didn't realize you can't trust the

782
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,409
client you should always validate on the

783
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:29,809
server side because even if a user has

784
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,399
JavaScript turned on has a browser

785
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:34,100
capable of doing html5 validation you

786
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,720
can't assume that the validation

787
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,610
criteria was actually met it's totally

788
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,679
inconsequential to change a web pages

789
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,080
markup to adjust scripts to adjust forms

790
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,299
or otherwise compromise a web page using

791
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,159
only only the tools that are built into

792
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,809
virtually every browser out there how

793
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:49,159
many of you have changed a form in order

794
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:51,519
to actually be able to submit it yeah

795
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,159
this happens all the time right we need

796
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:57,110
to actually never trust the client we

797
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,009
need to always make sure we're getting

798
00:29:58,009 --> 00:29:59,720
what we're expecting and since the

799
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,220
server side is your last line of defense

800
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,100
we need to be ready to to go back to

801
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,419
that form again and provide information

802
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:07,100
about what the errors are that we

803
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,080
encountered so we want to server

804
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,999
summarize those server-side errors in

805
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:14,090
some sort of message at the top put it

806
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,409
at the top of the form start with a

807
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:17,090
helpful introduction there were some

808
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,490
errors with your form submission list

809
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,929
the errors and the orders they're that

810
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:23,389
they're presented in the form and link

811
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:25,369
to each of those fields that have an

812
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:27,080
error the nice thing is we've got anchor

813
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,360
references directly to those fields

814
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,879
because they all have IDs on them right

815
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,960
so that makes it really simple to do so

816
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,659
and if you add a roll of alert in some

817
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,940
browsers although the this is kind of

818
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,590
abdomen and changed over the time but

819
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,789
some of them do something cool like this

820
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:42,710
when the page loads contact retreats for

821
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,269
geeks there were errors with your form

822
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:45,919
submission one message is a required

823
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,629
field two name is a required field three

824
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:50,450
email is a required field how friggin

825
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,850
awesome is that that's so helpful when

826
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,629
you can't visually see the form right

827
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:58,190
then use the pattern I showed earlier to

828
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,659
make sure that you indicate in line with

829
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,759
the actual problem with is and help

830
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,580
people to solve that and of course make

831
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,929
sure that you bring back the value that

832
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:07,220
they entered in case they just have to

833
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,710
make a slight change to it

834
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,500
so hTML is a truly robust and expressive

835
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,330
language but it's often overlooked and

836
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,010
undervalued but it has the incredible

837
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,690
potential to nurture conversations with

838
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,610
our users without requiring a whole lot

839
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,770
of effort on our part simply taking the

840
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,840
time to code web page as well will

841
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,490
enable our sites to do more thereby

842
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,790
enabling our users to do more hopefully

843
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,590
this rather brief overview has opened up

844
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,240
your eyes to the wonderful world of HTML

845
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,830
and how semantic markup can make our

846
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,800
content structured sensible and most

847
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,870
importantly meaningful and if you are

848
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,550
already a true believer I hope you walk

849
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,720
away from this session with a few new

850
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,040
techniques that you can put to use in

851
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,270
your own work thank you all very much
