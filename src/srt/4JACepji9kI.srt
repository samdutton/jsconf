1
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,450

there's mac bit more on the lead

2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,940
engineer so if the tables um a little

3
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,440
bit about us a little bit about this

4
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,560
slide right here in going about this

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,380
talk mom one of the things that I

6
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,420
realize is that for a lot of people

7
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,040
remote work means that everyone in the

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,380
office is remote for this talk I'm

9
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,720
really talking about remote employees at

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,829
like a very centralized company on so as

11
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,420
social tables were a pretty flat

12
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,220
organization we are doing tons of like

13
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,409
quick one on one's full hand meetings

14
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,440
we're all in an office in DC but my wife

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,520
is in international development um this

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,790
is made my wife in Swaziland and so thus

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,010
from time to time she's gone for like

18
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,180
months on end in foreign countries not

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,590
the third world because that's the

20
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,460
Soviet error term the developing world

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,750
and Swaziland is actually really safe

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,780
but um it's internet connectivity does

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,930
really suffer this is who I am um MC

24
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,060
whittemore on github and twitter follow

25
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,689
me what is social tables social tables

26
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,970
event planning software um we are

27
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,530
somehow involved in the planning of this

28
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,020
event not really sure I just got told up

29
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,290
earlier today so we make software that

30
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,560
plans these kinds of events um I'm going

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,020
to Swaziland so why do land as a country

32
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,850
in southern Africa it's not the one

33
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,400
inside of South Africa it's the one

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,599
between Mozambique and South Africa um

35
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,150
it's the highest aids rate in the world

36
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,220
um

37
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,630
arguably that's because there are more

38
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,650
honest people than other people's that's

39
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,180
a little bit swaziland and that's why my

40
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,850
wife is there here is where on the

41
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,830
continent of Africa you can find

42
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,770
Swaziland and today swaziland looks much

43
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,790
more like this than like our straw on

44
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,170
Shaq I saw you a couple seconds ago

45
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,730
which by the way that door is like this

46
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,940
height and so you have to like crawl in

47
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,710
and so that if someone was trying to

48
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,090
steal in your house you could just mount

49
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,220
them over the head cool swaziland fact

50
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,440
so I've spent nine months of my life now

51
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,350
working remotely um first six of it I

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,050
quit my job because of it it was

53
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,850
absolutely horrible again I worked for a

54
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,640
very like centralized team at that time

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,420
in Atlanta and while we talked about how

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,180
to interact with people we never really

57
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,900
worked on it um so on coming to social

58
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,030
tables and knowing that this was in my

59
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,950
future we started talking about a lot

60
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,480
how do you introduce something some way

61
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,860
for an entity to help the communication

62
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,170
process right because if every day of

63
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,610
your life is about interacting with a

64
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,519
person at your office and then suddenly

65
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,650
that person isn't there and there is

66
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,450
nobody else working remotely your

67
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,790
default behavior isn't go get on google

68
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,620
hangouts and have a meeting your default

69
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,140
behavior is talked to the next guy talk

70
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,709
to the next gal and so we we came up

71
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,440
with this concept called I Matthew in

72
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,660
which we literally turned myself into a

73
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,070
robot um it is this I Matthew not iphone

74
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,060
Matthew and so for the next three months

75
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,880
I was him I was a robot at our company

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,970
um this is me in some meeting it looks

77
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,170
like I'm leading it but that's just

78
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,370
because that's where they had to put me

79
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,269
I'm not leading it this is me hanging

80
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,060
out with one of our sales people um and

81
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,479
then this is me at our weekly weekly All

82
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,229
Hands so again like here you see me this

83
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:22,120
is the metaphysics part like literally

84
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,750
being a robot I can't walk around the

85
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,539
office so someone has to drag me around

86
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:29,009
the off

87
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,249
um we didn't we like thought of this

88
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,650
like two days before i left so we like

89
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,439
had all these crazy ideas about using

90
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,619
Johnny Five and like whipping up

91
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:41,819
something to make me able to move around

92
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,029
but that didn't happen so you are

93
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:47,939
suddenly a quadriplegic for all

94
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,819
intensive purposes inside the office I

95
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,969
which really raised some interesting

96
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:55,770
problems for me after about three months

97
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,099
um because I can't like just have that

98
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:03,300
meeting people still um still thought of

99
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,770
me as that entity he still came to me as

100
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,689
that entity but I couldn't come to them

101
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,210
um so slight little downfall about this

102
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,979
way it'll eventually make the person

103
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:16,889
feel I mean like their robot so we're

104
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,499
going to talk about these five things um

105
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:20,789
but first I want to just quickly talk

106
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,279
about why people should work remotely

107
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,199
because I actually as much as I've

108
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,669
struggled with it I think it's a really

109
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,800
it's a thing especially in our field

110
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,229
that we can take advantage of there's

111
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:32,550
the whole argument about productivity

112
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,419
I'll get into that I think we live in an

113
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,409
amazing world and we can work anywhere

114
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,439
for the most part and I know so many

115
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,009
people on who feel bound to their small

116
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:49,889
you know worlds wherever they live no

117
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,629
matter how large or small the city and

118
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:56,399
it's just not true anymore so the fun

119
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,479
pictures of lions and tigers and bears

120
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,159
these are the reasons why you should

121
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,740
work remotely there are only six hundred

122
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,939
wild dogs in the world about and I got

123
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,669
to see one actually a lot there are lots

124
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:19,229
of crocodiles um drafts baboons on and

125
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,759
of course the obvious one which is

126
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,639
work-life balance um yeah there's you

127
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,129
know going to remote parts of the world

128
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:27,809
and seeing things that you know only

129
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:30,419
small parts of humanity sees but there's

130
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,110
also raising your kids I'm not yet to

131
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,909
but will be two in the next couple of

132
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:39,659
years um and I mean my wife works

133
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:42,600
remotely in foreign countries so

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,880
it's gonna fall more on me um and like

135
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,830
we should be figuring out how to do that

136
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,050
better so sort of meetings what does it

137
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,560
take to be a robot in a meeting um we're

138
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,610
going to go through these basically as

139
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,440
problems and then quasi solutions

140
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,760
because I haven't really found solutions

141
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,900
number one problem with being a robot in

142
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,340
the meeting is that microphones aren't

143
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,530
ears I mean vol probably seeing this

144
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,390
with conference calls like you start

145
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,850
talking over each other but again if

146
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,260
you're the only robot in the meeting no

147
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,050
one else realizes that you can't hear so

148
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,400
if you're working with remote workers

149
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,310
remember they can't focus on you and so

150
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,580
if we're having a conversation and

151
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,900
someone else is trying to talk I'm

152
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,870
hearing all three of you talking at the

153
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,460
same as the same person so how we sort

154
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,540
of dealt with trying to solve that

155
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,470
problem is we introduced rip chat so we

156
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,360
actually do a lot of our started doing a

157
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
lot more of our communication over chat

158
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,960
we've used shat traditionally but in

159
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,210
much more like siloed ways and with

160
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,120
HipChat not to like give that lassie in

161
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,180
like PR but with HipChat you can just

162
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,830
like open random rooms and just start

163
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,250
dialogues um so meetings would often

164
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,570
have chat rooms brainstorming the next

165
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,470
big problem um I think especially for me

166
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,630
at least I'm a white border I'm assuming

167
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,640
and a raise of people in this room who

168
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,140
loves the whiteboard yeah so like there

169
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,150
aren't great white boarding solutions

170
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,310
they're definitely aren't great white

171
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,800
boarding solutions over 3g internet and

172
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
they're definitely aren't great white

173
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
boarding solutions over a 3g internet

174
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,640
which is what there is in Swaziland when

175
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,900
everyone gets out of work and starts

176
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,919
using their cell phones and so what we

177
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,800
ended up doing on sometimes was having a

178
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,630
whiteboard and having like a camera

179
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,640
pointed yeah my robot pointed at the

180
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,590
whiteboard and I would be like oh yeah

181
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,020
you should draw the Box bigger and like

182
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,720
that's the kind of conversations um so

183
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,220
white boarding is definitely a problem

184
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,730
um the best solution I think that we

185
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,680
came up with was just straight up using

186
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,490
Google Docs

187
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,640
um again this is you know obviously just

188
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,149
trying to recreate a whiteboard um but

189
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,830
i'm i'm warming google drive like being

190
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,330
able to just type and like putting ideas

191
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:13,529
down so solution sort of obviously not

192
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:17,580
as good as a whiteboard so focusing

193
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,230
distractions on one of the reasons i

194
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,149
think that we like to think remote work

195
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:23,370
is great is that there's a lot of

196
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,589
research that says that engineers are

197
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,110
productive when they're not distracted

198
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,360
and that in the office you get

199
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,640
distracted all the time there's this

200
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,260
book that i just found out about my

201
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,730
research that I want to read called why

202
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,790
programmers work at night I know there's

203
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,140
Georgia Tech has done a bunch of

204
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,630
research on this and it like the amount

205
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,180
of time that it takes an engineer oh it

206
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,630
takes really any creative worker to get

207
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,750
back to where they were is ridiculous

208
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,670
and so we talk about remote work as this

209
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,160
great sort of way of solving this

210
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,589
problem um but I think we often forget

211
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,170
that at least in the case of swaziland

212
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,149
there are like chickens that decide to

213
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:05,970
sleep in your coop I mean in your house

214
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,490
as their coop so like one day I woke up

215
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,079
and this chicken just wouldn't leave my

216
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,140
house um yeah it was fun um in Swaziland

217
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,770
there are also all my slides oh there

218
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,660
are also monkeys that decided your

219
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,399
avocados and at least for the first

220
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,839
couple of weeks that I was there I was

221
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,209
just like this is a monkey in my

222
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,630
backyard eating my avocados and every

223
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,510
time I were here now just be like monkey

224
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,730
get the camera go take a picture which

225
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,620
actually only happened once and this is

226
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,270
not from that because that pictures

227
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,490
really blurry um so I mean there's

228
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,329
things the thing about when you're

229
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:45,240
working remotely on that like obviously

230
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,520
you don't have your boss walking in or

231
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,980
you know somebody else walking in and

232
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,890
asking you a question but I mean you do

233
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,010
still have people interrupting you and

234
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,779
when you're working six hours ahead of

235
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,860
schedule um as I was in Swaziland your

236
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,390
co-workers become an interesting

237
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,820
interruption because they all get into

238
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,350
work at say your 4pm which is at least

239
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,670
traditionally for me my most productive

240
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,250
time and is traditionally for them their

241
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,800
least productive time and so chats

242
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,650
explode like emails start getting sent

243
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,300
out and like these ideas that I've been

244
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,220
working on in like my siloed little

245
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,950
universe in swaziland just suddenly gets

246
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,610
smashed on fun things though you do

247
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,620
learn when all of your co-workers wake

248
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,110
up on and if they check their email when

249
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,240
they get out of bed um when you're

250
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,750
working that far ahead um for instance

251
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,270
dawn who's our CEO gets up like three

252
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,490
hours ahead of most people and add who's

253
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,410
actually in the room that's up read

254
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,510
about the time he gets to work so um

255
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,650
lastly um for just general thing some

256
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,110
motivation I think is really hard when

257
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,030
you're this kind of remote worker um and

258
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,230
this is this is one that actually i

259
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,710
think really kind of hits home for me we

260
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:12,030
we're we're sitting alone um you're like

261
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,560
working on this great product you know

262
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,730
you can think of sort of like those

263
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,650
entrepreneurs who are like just starting

264
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,560
something and that's like that's great

265
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,450
but when you start to get a little bit

266
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,100
bigger you have this you know we're

267
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,200
working on this together and once you

268
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,810
get siloed into a foreign cotton like a

269
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,150
continent far far away you can no longer

270
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,440
have that interaction in the lack of

271
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,690
forth and like the motivation to make

272
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,240
your code better to like iterate on your

273
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,950
product to you know be a good employee

274
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,650
starts to the mesh um so the thing that

275
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,020
I think we found worked best was sort of

276
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,430
going back to more of that like early

277
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,990
stage startup that early like there's

278
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,520
only one or two of you working on this

279
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,610
product and like saying you own this so

280
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,950
that when i woke up at two a.m. eastern

281
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,450
standard time and got to work like I had

282
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,030
my work and like this is what I was

283
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,030
doing um so that you know obviously that

284
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,600
that's I loathe you more and there are

285
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,220
problems with that metaphysical fun

286
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,700
problems with that but it also does let

287
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,170
you own something and I think ownership

288
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,720
is really key task management is really

289
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,010
hard unless you have someone who's

290
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,329
really really far

291
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:27,949
head of their scheduling um because

292
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:31,199
sometimes I would just like get through

293
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:34,619
like 10 stories and then all of the work

294
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:37,980
that was scheduled would be done and it

295
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,819
would be like 38 you know 5am in the

296
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:44,879
East Coast and no one's waking up which

297
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,499
is why eventually we moved to more of an

298
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:49,199
oriented um like ownership oriented

299
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,999
structure that said like I really think

300
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,879
the problem with this single remote

301
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,170
worker is that we don't think about it

302
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,389
we sort of use this picture as an

303
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:07,529
analogy think work is work we think a

304
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,119
road is a road we think they're like

305
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:12,660
every time it's the same and especially

306
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,009
in the United States I think we define

307
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:15,569
work is coming into the office and

308
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:18,720
typing on and letting our managers or

309
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,259
our co-workers or whoever we have peer

310
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:27,480
pressure from CES typing I mean

311
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,040
obviously like we think it is a lot more

312
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,809
than that but if we define it down to

313
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:32,579
like the bare minimums I think that's

314
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,089
what we think work is but once like work

315
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,149
is completely remote once work is you

316
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:41,129
know not possible to be you in a room

317
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:44,759
typing I think we have to start really

318
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,850
getting down to like what is work and

319
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,540
like what that means what that means in

320
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,049
your company so we you know we spent

321
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:57,509
some time and we created this I Matthew

322
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:00,329
concept we actually have a new remote

323
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:03,389
worker who she's just moved out on to

324
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:06,529
Colorado and so we have an I Claire now

325
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,779
and and it's definitely something that

326
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,629
works on definitely something that helps

327
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:14,309
but I think if you're ever in a place

328
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,439
where you're thinking about siloing

329
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,749
yourself remote working yourself you

330
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:21,350
know large not even large just like in a

331
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,629
centralized company on a non distributed

332
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,699
company it's something that that really

333
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,360
needs to be thought of because if

334
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,689
everyone on the team is not completely

335
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:35,639
about trying to solve this work problem

336
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,830
your remote worker will be a

337
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,160
inated no matter how much you don't want

338
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,890
that to be true and eventually like what

339
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,720
happened to me before they'll just leave

340
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,580
like it's really easy especially if

341
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,930
they're in the United States to

342
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,960
interview while your remote working

343
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,250
really easy so things the thing about um

344
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,130
that said i would love questions answers

345
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,840
and discussions there's a sweet small

346
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,420
group so like stories about an auction

347
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,040
or where we are in time but some

348
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,960
questions if anyone has them but you can

349
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,500
also look at more fun pictures of

350
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,600
swaziland um that said baboons by the

351
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,630
way or like my least favorite animal um

352
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,920
well it doesn't help that i was there

353
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,760
during a boon mating season um but like

354
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,520
they would just like throw like random

355
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,430
seeds at us like we were like so if you

356
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,800
look at this this picture the end of the

357
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,990
presentation you can actually this like

358
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,270
it's called the comb be this like van

359
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,250
thing he's what we were in the whole

360
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,590
time because you don't want to be not in

361
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,660
the van thing when these guys are around

362
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,050
um but like the baboons are just like on

363
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,700
the treat like this tons of animals are

364
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,980
just like on the street like this oh and

365
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,290
the baboons are more or less okay with

366
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,610
you unless they're not okay with you and

367
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,750
then they just like start throwing

368
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,630
things they're very territorial um when

369
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,790
I was in Honduras briefly and I had

370
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,980
black baboons chase us because we

371
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,880
accidentally walked through their

372
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,070
territory but you should check out wild

373
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,720
dogs I didn't know about this at all by

374
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,459
the way but kruger national park which

375
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,199
is where all these pictures are from is

376
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,949
in south africa and there are 600 might

377
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:27,600
be a little bit low balling it but they

378
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,730
are like a completely dying thing um and

379
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,870
they're really rare to see they'd never

380
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,300
stopped moving and this one is injured

381
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,140
actually just sad but cool because I got

382
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,660
to see thing that barely exists i don't

383
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,890
know how i feel about that um yeah um

384
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,680
any questions comments wisecracks

385
00:17:50,680 --> 00:18:02,009
it's my ninth grade teacher used to say

386
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:08,840
um no we we well we started profiling a

387
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,549
bunch of things like a couple of days

388
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:14,510
before and so yeah um it is there's a

389
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,940
bunch of them any bought and then it

390
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,340
might pull this off the top of his head

391
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,610
better there's a couple of them that do

392
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,990
look really cool have you ever used any

393
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:46,760
butter

394
00:18:46,770 --> 00:19:01,450
yeah Nick

395
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,289
haha I don't know um Romney how did you

396
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,330
feel about me being like hey call people

397
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:15,330
for me oh so rally was was generally the

398
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,279
person who he was the one who got

399
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,440
hangouts cuz there's a couple of people

400
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,850
that would struggle with hangouts for

401
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,309
some reason um and so I would just be

402
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,259
like Rami called this person and he

403
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:26,879
became like quickly the default person

404
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:29,759
um I think really it does it just comes

405
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:31,679
down to everyone owning it I mean like

406
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,419
this like make this your own like your

407
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,909
company can't have remote workers and

408
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,769
this not be part of your culture like

409
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:40,320
you just can't do that like you will

410
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,169
lose the employee like that's the bottom

411
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:45,570
line um and so yeah like I mean if their

412
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,460
remote for a couple of weeks or a couple

413
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,789
of days or you know it's not gonna be

414
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,369
part of your culture on though I think

415
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:54,600
if you're thinking about people being

416
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,580
remote it's probably better to think

417
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,309
about it now and like make people use

418
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,340
this any but you know make people cart

419
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,059
am a vcard around um or else seriously

420
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:11,830
guys like it it can get really bad um so
