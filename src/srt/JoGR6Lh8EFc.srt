1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,680

cool right thank you so much

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,570
yeah I'm Harry I'm here to talk about

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,300
why fast matters it's quite a long talk

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,420
I've had to trim a couple of slides out

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,560
these slides that I share at the end

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,270
will be the full version of the talk so

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,150
check those out yeah let's get straight

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,039
into it so I'm Harry I'm a consultant

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,920
developer from Leeds which is a city in

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,420
the north of England

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,890
I'm currently focusing a lot on

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,560
performance so I know this is CSS conf

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,420
but a lot of my work at the moment folks

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,000
is very strongly on kind of performance

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,890
engineering helping clients make their

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,510
sites faster more reliable more

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,450
resilient and just real quickly I only

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,690
gone a bit of a tangent three years ago

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,239
it comes in Paris I met the organisers

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,789
of CSS called Budapest and as soon as I

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,649
heard the word CSS come from Budapest I

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,840
was like I need to be there I have to be

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,969
and for a few years it didn't happen and

24
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,859
I finally got the email this year I was

25
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,870
like yes like whatever I need to do I

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,080
will be there I arrived on Saturday I've

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
been exploring a city

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,979
absolutely beautiful city incredible

29
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,630
city really great food and drink the

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,479
people are really nice but monday was a

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,610
national holiday right so museums were

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,619
closed everything was closed so I

33
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,479
decided well Monday is the day I will

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,759
spend walking I'll spend that day

35
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,580
outside because can't go to museums so I

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,259
took a walk up to the the Statue of

37
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,090
Liberty anyone being up there yeah

38
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,280
beautiful but it wasn't on Monday it was

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,860
terrible weather this is such a bad idea

40
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,110
I can barely keep my eyes open so the

41
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,880
rain was coming in sideways my hair is

42
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,829
all over the place absolutely dreadful

43
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,680
horrible weather so I mean I'm English

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,850
right so I'm kind of used to it but

45
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,939
still wasn't right but then sorrow

46
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,380
landed yesterday owners like sorrow

47
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,090
let's I need to go back it's good

48
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,950
weather so went up again yesterday and

49
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,159
how beautiful is that look at that this

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,689
is the view I was treated to yesterday

51
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:55,979
afternoon and what I thought was quite

52
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,750
nice was

53
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,230
check that out anyway right

54
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,140
let's get down to it I've got like 98

55
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,410
slides left I work for a lot of

56
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,390
different clients right I'm a consultant

57
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,460
I'm very lucky very fortunate very

58
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,830
privileged that in the last four you in

59
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,720
fact my company turns four years old

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,520
today right I've been working for myself

61
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,710
for four years starting today right now

62
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,270
it's my company's birthday which is

63
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,210
pretty baller and yeah I've worked with

64
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,100
some beautiful wonderful clients over

65
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,750
the last few years being very very

66
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,210
privileged one of these clients the

67
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,970
train line sort of Center bottom their

68
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,030
train line is a European company who

69
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,570
sell train tickets when they released a

70
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,090
case that he recently a couple years ago

71
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,890
maybe which said that if they could

72
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,350
reduce latency by just 0.3 seconds

73
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,630
customers would spend around eight point

74
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,620
1 million pounds more every year so I've

75
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,850
actually been helping them with this

76
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,620
body of work it's been very fascinating

77
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,630
very insightful and the good news is

78
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,250
it's actually kind of easy to make a

79
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,050
sight point three seconds faster right

80
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,040
it's not much time at all

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,230
but at point three seconds had a

82
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,230
tangible sort of measurable impact on

83
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,750
their baseline right 8.1 million pounds

84
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,130
a year another company unfortunately not

85
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,190
a client of mine but Netflix saw a 43

86
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,110
percent decrease in their bandwidth bill

87
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,260
simply by turning on gzip a couple of

88
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,170
things here like who turned gzip off in

89
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,380
the first place like this case that he

90
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,540
should really say Netflix used to waste

91
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,700
43 percent of their bandwidth bill vine

92
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,040
not having jeez it turned on um but the

93
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,019
second thing is 43 percent is an

94
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,330
enormous number 40 imagine if you went

95
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,310
to a restaurant and for some reason they

96
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,530
decided to give you 43 percent off your

97
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,410
bill it's a huge number so imagine what

98
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,209
that translates to translates to in

99
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,400
savings for somebody the size of Netflix

100
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,500
so they saved a huge amount of money

101
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,880
here GQ kind of lifestyle magazine they

102
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,830
cut load time is by a very very

103
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,280
impressive 80% and in return so an 80%

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,380
increase in organic traffic so not

105
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,329
search not paid for kind of completely

106
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:12,860
organic traffic

107
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,080
and over that increase the median time

108
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,660
on site went up by 32% this is a really

109
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,370
great case study for when your clients

110
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,079
or your your managers or whoever tell

111
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,000
you that well we're not ecommerce right

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,890
we're not ecommerce so we don't think

113
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,260
performance equals money well might it

114
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,090
may not do but it will increase

115
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,590
engagement it will keep people more

116
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,900
loyal and as much as I hate to mention

117
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,620
it GQ has ads on their site right so

118
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,450
this will translate to more money that

119
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,950
eventually it will make them more cash

120
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,080
imagine increasing ad impressions by

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,730
nearly a third right so it will

122
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,570
ultimately translate to money by golly

123
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,950
these case studies from

124
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,440
WPO stats calm this is a fantastic

125
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
resource if you ever struggle to sell

126
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,100
performance to your managers your

127
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,290
clients it's full of really good

128
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,700
information but the reason I picked

129
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,740
these three specific case studies is

130
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,480
because each one tells us something

131
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,970
different the first one it will make us

132
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,290
more money right or make the business

133
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,290
more money the second one it will save

134
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,210
as money right performance will reduce

135
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,370
our costs in fact I work for a company

136
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,680
recently and just by optimizing for

137
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,900
performance we reduced their data

138
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,169
overheads by 62% like we reduce their

139
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,660
transfer by 62% just by focusing on

140
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,030
performance and thirdly it will just

141
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,770
make users happier we know from our own

142
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,510
experience that slow websites are

143
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,640
tedious and we don't use them we abandon

144
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,060
them but what I want to talk about today

145
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,710
in this talk is another side to

146
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,600
performance because nearly all the time

147
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,160
when we discuss performance we've got a

148
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,990
very westernized kind of very

149
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,540
capitalistic view of what it's about I

150
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,490
want to talk about the non financial

151
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,130
side of things I believe there's a kind

152
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,440
of ethical and a moral side to

153
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,150
performance there are moral reasons why

154
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,740
we should be fast and why we should

155
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,570
focus on building fast and performant

156
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,680
websites I've got three short anecdotes

157
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,410
out to share with you anecdotes aren't

158
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,210
great because obviously anecdotes aren't

159
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,430
the same as evidence or data but these

160
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,080
are three really interesting stories

161
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,750
that all happened to me this year so I'm

162
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,460
not talking about the Internet five or

163
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,750
10 years ago I'm talking about the

164
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,310
internet in 2017 first one I was

165
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,810
organizing an event with a friend of

166
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,580
mine my friend runs a really really

167
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,770
great coffee shop in Leeds and I sent

168
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,729
him an email and it was in

169
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:27,620
Porter email and he just did not reply

170
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,509
to me and I was stressing right so I was

171
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,610
like we need to we need to decide what's

172
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,240
gonna happen

173
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,860
so eventually I just went into the

174
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,930
coffee shop and you said look dude like

175
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,699
you didn't reply to the email what's

176
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:38,180
going on

177
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,069
he was like I'm really sorry I was on

178
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,839
holiday in Thailand and I got a push

179
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,789
notification telling me I received an

180
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,069
email but the data connection out there

181
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,749
was so weak that I couldn't actually

182
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:50,809
open it I hadn't sent a huge 20 mega

183
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,729
attachment it was just a simple plain

184
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:55,639
text email but he left the data of the

185
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,080
kind of the connectivity to actually

186
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,819
open and read it the next one somebody

187
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,080
sent me an email and this happens quite

188
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,580
often someone sent me an email asking

189
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,379
for some advice just general kind of

190
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:08,449
career advice and I sent a really long

191
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:11,180
response and after about two weeks the

192
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,589
person still haven't replied to me and I

193
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,539
was like nah that's kind of rude I did

194
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:15,949
put a lot of effort into the reply but

195
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,899
you know whatever I'll get over it but

196
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,339
then a few days after that like sort of

197
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,469
two three weeks later I get a response

198
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:22,819
he's like I'm really sorry for the

199
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,499
delayed delayed reply I've been on a

200
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,149
really bad connection and I was like

201
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,339
well I will forgive you if you tell me

202
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:30,439
everything you mean by bad connection

203
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,959
and this is what he said I'm currently

204
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,610
at my parents place in Rajasthan which

205
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,069
is northern India since my parents don't

206
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:38,569
have a computer they only consume

207
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,909
internet through their smartphone we

208
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,709
were alone Internet services by telco

209
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,560
providers which in our town are still 2g

210
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,659
some providers claim to be 3G but I've

211
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,770
never seen that happening

212
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,110
right now I've got a connector sorry

213
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,270
right now I've connected my laptop via a

214
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,639
Wi-Fi hotspot and opening the basic

215
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,159
version of Gmail takes between 30 and 60

216
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,770
seconds most other sites I just use

217
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,120
mobile Chrome because that will make

218
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,999
savings for me so two interesting things

219
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:08,270
here I've used the basic HTML version of

220
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,059
Gmail maybe five six times in my entire

221
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:13,520
life and what I do I'm like god this is

222
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,569
the worst thing ever

223
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,370
all right and it loads and it's fine and

224
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,639
it's a bit clunky but it works this

225
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,319
person has to use it all the time and it

226
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,509
still takes up to a minute to load the

227
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:26,779
basic version of Gmail the second thing

228
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:29,689
and more interestingly here is when you

229
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,279
go home you've probably got a Rooter in

230
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,169
the corner of your room that beams out

231
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,390
Wi-Fi and if you're lucky that Wi-Fi

232
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,370
might be backed by a fiber network and

233
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,280
that's how we get online

234
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,990
this guy's family a hundred percent of

235
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,030
the time they're getting online it's not

236
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,100
via Wi-Fi it's not by a broadband it's

237
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,900
not a dedicated connection they don't

238
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,940
have a Rooter in the corner of the room

239
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,280
they've got a commodity Android device

240
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,900
which is beaming out a 2g connection

241
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,050
high latency low bandwidth device a

242
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,730
hundred percent of the time third one

243
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,420
that happened to me

244
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,550
I got a DM again simply asking for

245
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,920
advice I'm not cold at Harry on Twitter

246
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,500
so I don't know who got the notification

247
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,810
um but this this person pinged me asking

248
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,190
for some advice and this is a Nepalese

249
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,790
developer now completely as a soft side

250
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,500
kind of coincidence I'd worked out from

251
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,390
my Google Analytics that Nepal was a

252
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,460
problem region for my site my site was

253
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,310
slow in Nepal so I gave this guy some

254
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,960
answers and I said oh by the way whilst

255
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,980
I have your attention

256
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,110
does my website feel slow for you

257
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,700
because my analytics tells me that my

258
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,590
website is slow in Nepal and his

259
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,780
response was astounding he said no I

260
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,460
don't think so I mean I click through to

261
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,730
your site and it loads within a minute

262
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,720
and that didn't feel slow if we were to

263
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,220
visit a website that took a minute to

264
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,960
load we'd assume the website was down

265
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,760
right we'd borrow the websites down or

266
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,710
go somewhere else this person was like

267
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,670
oh that's fast a minute good work

268
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,830
and the worst thing here right the other

269
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,420
thing I want to mention is that my site

270
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,250
is meant to be fast right my site if you

271
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,590
visit my site from Dublin for example or

272
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,160
from Los Angeles or whatever it'll be

273
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,880
fully rendered within 1.3 seconds the

274
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,430
exact same codebase the exact same CDN

275
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,690
the exact same infrastructure but

276
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,930
visited from Nepal they pay a penalty of

277
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,620
hype 58 seconds just to visit my site

278
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,870
imagine what it's like for this person

279
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,190
visiting sites that haven't been

280
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,610
optimized it must be completely tiresome

281
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,660
it must be in fact almost impossible you

282
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,830
may have noticed a couple of things

283
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,290
about this though um one of the most

284
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,210
important being that all of these

285
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,740
stories all of these things they

286
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,160
happened in in the Far East has anybody

287
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,020
heard of a initiative called the next

288
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,810
billion users anyone heard of this yeah

289
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,610
not many okay so just

290
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,870
right because when you google it you'll

291
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,540
find this resource from quartz which is

292
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,149
a very good canonical resource all about

293
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:02,029
the next billion Internet users there

294
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,529
are roughly it's actually more than a

295
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,860
billion but 1 billion 253 million is

296
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,529
less catchy I guess the next billion

297
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,000
users coming online are all coming

298
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,890
online from emerging economies and what

299
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,630
are those emerging economy economies are

300
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,180
in the Far East you may have seen this

301
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,040
graphic before more people live inside

302
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,440
of that highlighted area than outside of

303
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,019
it even taking into account how much

304
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,300
ocean there is under that highlighted

305
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,940
area more people live inside of it than

306
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,700
outside of it when you consider that

307
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,350
this contains places like Indonesia

308
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,410
India Bangladesh very densely populated

309
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,570
areas it soon starts to make sense but

310
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,420
this is the majority of our next billion

311
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,010
users these are who we need to optimize

312
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,279
for I'm still really quickly run through

313
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,370
some stats around some of these regions

314
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,649
some of some of the countries in this

315
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:57,320
region bangladesh average connection

316
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,480
about three and a half Meg only 15% of

317
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,180
people are online 3.9 million broadband

318
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,070
subscribers represents 2.4 percent of

319
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,230
the population on a dedicated broadband

320
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,029
connection what we would actually call

321
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:11,089
Wi-Fi or or Ethernet you know like a

322
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:12,709
broadband dedicated connection but with

323
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:17,329
134 million cellular subscriptions 83%

324
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,430
of the population get online via mobile

325
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,709
highline's hielo bandwidth that

326
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,709
represents a delta of 34 34 times more

327
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,070
people get online with mobile only than

328
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,500
they do with broadband in Bangladesh

329
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,880
India three and a half Meg four of

330
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,070
people online 1.3 percent of the

331
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,449
population have a dedicated internet

332
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:38,630
connection but with 1 billion and that's

333
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,019
not a typo that's a billion with a B

334
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:44,209
cellular subscriptions 79% of Indians

335
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,339
get online with a high latency low

336
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,230
bandwidth connection that's 58 times

337
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,880
more people these numbers only get worse

338
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,440
Pakistan average connection two and a

339
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,079
half Meg a fifth of people are online

340
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,850
1.8 million subscribers for broadband

341
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,529
represents just one percent of the

342
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,370
population with a reliable network 126

343
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,230
million cellular subscribers represents

344
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,590
67% with a unreliable mobile only

345
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,200
connection that's 70 times more people

346
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,440
and finally I think these are the slides

347
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,090
I thought I'd cut out so this is a

348
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,950
surprise to me as well these are all

349
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,270
this data was meant to be skipped over

350
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,610
in this talk fastest connection of the

351
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,130
group four and a half Meg represents a

352
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,130
fifth of people online just 1.1 percent

353
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,570
of the population have a dedicated

354
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,530
connection but weird phenomenon here 132

355
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,930
percent of the population have a mobile

356
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,030
connection and this represents people

357
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,560
with more than one cellular subscription

358
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,110
more than one SIM card I've got two SIM

359
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,270
cards I've got a different travel sim

360
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,950
that's cheaper to use abroad than my

361
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,830
British one so Indonesia a lot of people

362
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,880
will have more than one cellular

363
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,850
subscription and the Far East is the

364
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,080
fastest-growing economy on the planet

365
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,480
and Indonesia is its fastest growing

366
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,720
country so this may represent how or why

367
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,400
it's got this kind of growth in in

368
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,880
mobile but this represents 121 times

369
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,880
more people getting online via a solely

370
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,760
high latency low bandwidth connection if

371
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,200
we average the data out we'll quickly

372
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,050
see that three and a Half Men connection

373
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,510
twenty percent of people are online . so

374
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,890
eighty percent of the population

375
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,390
aren't even online yet these are our

376
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,420
next billion users only one and a half

377
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,940
percent one point four five percent of

378
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,280
this region actually have broadband

379
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,720
actually have a proper internet

380
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,180
connection whereas a staggering 90

381
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,210
percent of that region has a mobile only

382
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,650
device let's contrast that we're looking

383
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,280
at nearly 14 Meg speeds three-quarters

384
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,710
of people here are online over 1/4 I've

385
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,750
dedicated broadband and actually again

386
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,350
right here 118 119 percent of people

387
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,960
have more than one device

388
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,970
we're contrasting very very different

389
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,340
views any time I do this kind of talk in

390
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,840
the West I tailor kind of this slide to

391
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,480
each individual country we are doing so

392
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,360
much better so much better than people

393
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,330
in the Far East so what does this tell

394
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,400
us it tells us a few things we're

395
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,630
building for a totally different class

396
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,430
of views a completely dn't profile of

397
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,010
user it also means that we need to

398
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,960
change our technological decisions when

399
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,420
we talk about building mobile

400
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,090
first we normally think oh well I used

401
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,620
Minh with media queries right that's

402
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,650
mobile first not at all mobile first now

403
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,560
means don't build by default on a laptop

404
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,600
I have clients who do this all the time

405
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,730
they will build a specific MDOT website

406
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,620
and the moment most of their testing is

407
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,230
just resizing Chrome we need to build

408
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,350
testing first and foremost on a high

409
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,200
latency low bandwidth connection

410
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,920
optimize for the lowest common

411
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,560
denominator first because speed is a

412
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,600
feature right people I don't have access

413
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,720
to the same kind of infrastructure we do

414
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,010
when I go through this kind of stuff

415
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,050
with clients the first question I get

416
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,060
asked is how fast should we be how fast

417
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,910
is fast enough and the bad news is

418
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,320
there's no real answer to that question

419
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,330
I can't answer that very quickly but

420
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,160
normally if it's a very commercial sort

421
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,260
of a for-profit client I would normally

422
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,790
say just be faster than your nearest

423
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,170
competitor right that's probably the

424
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,060
quickest way to start just be faster

425
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,190
than the person who you want to be your

426
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,060
nearest sort of commercial competitor it

427
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,380
was a really great tool I found almost

428
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,190
by accident called dare boost dare boost

429
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,720
French startup kind of an odd name

430
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,920
especially when I say in my northern

431
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,440
accent dare boost sound very inspiring

432
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,070
but great little tool you can put your

433
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,080
web address in there's a guy he runs a

434
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,150
little site called CSS tricks I don't if

435
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,840
you've heard of him

436
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,030
but I thought right well let's benchmark

437
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,280
each other against ourselves and it

438
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,020
turns out I'm a little faster than his

439
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,250
site but then what you have to remember

440
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,800
is my sites like a personal blog or as

441
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,240
Chris's site is a full-on kind of

442
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,280
WordPress community so you do have to

443
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,540
kind of take into consideration

444
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,980
differences in the actual infrastructure

445
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,440
in the site itself but if you're working

446
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,910
with clients who don't know where to

447
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,370
start optimizing for performance start

448
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,100
here this tool is great

449
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,570
another tool substantially more

450
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,660
expensive but also very very good is

451
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,730
speed curve and these slides are all low

452
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,200
contrast I'm afraid but hopefully you

453
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,740
can see that we got like this historical

454
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,330
data where benchmarking several

455
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,060
different sites against one another

456
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,590
these kind of graphs these charts are

457
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,140
absolutely fantastic for proving to

458
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,700
non-technical stakeholders of the

459
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,790
business clients managers exactly how

460
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,650
well we're doing we don't need to tell

461
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,700
our manager that you know

462
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,000
DNS overhead is down by 3% or

463
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,970
we've reduced number requests by 15 no

464
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,110
need to know about that no one cares

465
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,730
about that all right we can show them

466
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,450
things like this cool so how do we get

467
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,830
there and this is the probably most

468
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,030
important bit

469
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,799
the first kind of part of this talk was

470
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,539
kind of a call to arms I guess I'm just

471
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,070
kind of laying the scene setting the

472
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,350
scene for how bad it is using the

473
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,000
Internet you know in different parts of

474
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,549
the world this next part of the talk is

475
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:58,530
going to be some sort of fundamental

476
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,450
advice and strategies on how to get

477
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,200
there I've got three kind of tips and

478
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
they're not like a BuzzFeed style like

479
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,820
you would not believe these three simple

480
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,520
things because they're not actually

481
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,539
there aren't even three of them there

482
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:16,020
are four but yeah these are going to be

483
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,760
fairly fundamental shifts they're not

484
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,320
going to be necessarily easy but they're

485
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,030
probably the biggest fundamental changes

486
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,679
you can make to workflows and company

487
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,049
culture to actually start building fast

488
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:27,510
websites and properly servicing people

489
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,190
who don't have the same infrastructure

490
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,100
as we do the reason I said three tips

491
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,690
when I meant before is because the first

492
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,520
one is actually like a throwaway kind of

493
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,940
a zero tip because honestly the zeroth

494
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,890
step in optimizing for performance is

495
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,960
just build build a fast website just go

496
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,299
and do it no one's gonna stop you now

497
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,830
this sounds very tongue-in-cheek this

498
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,210
sounds very like a pointless thing to

499
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,669
say but genuinely this is where I start

500
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:52,799
with all of my clients if you want a

501
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,690
fast website then make sure you've said

502
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,909
that you want a fast website it's not

503
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:58,679
gonna happen by accident it's not easy

504
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,870
to make a fast website so you need to

505
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,820
make sure that it's actually a goal you

506
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,690
need to make sure it's something that

507
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,049
you the team marketing design

508
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:08,760
stakeholders everyone needs to focus on

509
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,980
this goal so although it sounds like a

510
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,049
really silly throwaway comment this is

511
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,490
probably the most important thing you

512
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,270
and your team can do is actually decide

513
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,370
between yourselves and officially that

514
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,169
you want to have a fast website and

515
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:23,970
you'll be surprised how much easier it

516
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,390
gets okay let's start with the proper

517
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,260
stuff um

518
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,100
step one understand the problem but like

519
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,640
really properly understand it try your

520
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,080
site from a different kind of point of

521
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,080
view being fast or having a fast website

522
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,600
from your office in a nice European

523
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,470
capital city with blazing fast sort of

524
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,430
fiber connect

525
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,650
being fast in that environment isn't

526
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,170
fast that's not really fast if you can

527
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,760
be fast in the middle of a field in the

528
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,290
middle of nowhere on a 2g connection

529
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,450
then you're going to be fast everywhere

530
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,820
if you optimize for the worst possible

531
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,980
scenario everything else on top of that

532
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,860
is completely free if you start by doing

533
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,810
the hardest bit then everything on top

534
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,270
of that is already solved and it can't

535
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,430
get much simpler if you optimize for

536
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,590
what you're perceived worst case

537
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,050
scenario is everything else on top of it

538
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,140
is already solved Facebook did this

539
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,970
quite well they introduce them in called

540
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,690
2g Tuesday's this is where once a week

541
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,930
on a Tuesday oddly enough they

542
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,540
artificially throttled the speed of

543
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,220
their connection to Facebook's product

544
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,040
to a 2g connection so anybody working in

545
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,550
the Facebook offices any Facebook staff

546
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,200
visiting their products and services on

547
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,930
a Tuesday would be forced over a 2g like

548
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,720
connection so obviously it didn't affect

549
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,700
regular visitors but IP ring-fencing

550
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,440
they basically said any any staff

551
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,510
visiting the site on a Tuesday are going

552
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,310
to be forced through a 2g connection to

553
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,530
understand what it really feels like to

554
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,570
use our applications in emerging

555
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,640
economies and they soon realized that

556
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,350
like moon-like we've looked a very good

557
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,210
job here and it gave them a real sense

558
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,120
of empathy of a quick dose of like I've

559
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,700
been awakening and they started optimize

560
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,580
and they started to fix these things now

561
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,250
I personally as in like specifically me

562
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,260
I lack the skills to actually set up

563
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,730
this kind of infrastructure where we can

564
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,160
IP ring-fencing but what I can do and

565
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,140
what I do with clients is use a tool

566
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,910
called Charles proxy anybody heard of

567
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,510
Charles yeah it's quite a few of us so

568
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,030
Charles proxy is a it's a property it's

569
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,010
a network property but my favorite

570
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,350
feature of Charles is the the throttling

571
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,750
and you can throttle specific endpoints

572
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,700
so what you can do is you can slow your

573
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,860
entire machines traffic down but only to

574
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,370
certain like websites hosts so this

575
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,950
means that Oh Charles is free by the way

576
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,930
there's like a $50 paid for option but

577
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,490
it's free what this means is that I will

578
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,810
say to my clients okay all the

579
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,430
developers go and install Charles and

580
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,190
slow down just our website it means you

581
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,020
can listen to Spotify just fine

582
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,820
it means you can do email you can do

583
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,930
what you need to do you can get to

584
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,940
stackoverflow nice and quickly but just

585
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,010
our website let's slow that down and

586
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,900
let's see how it feels and the

587
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,820
frustration that the developers who

588
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,080
built the website themselves the

589
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,360
frustration they feel is usually enough

590
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,960
of a motivation to start fixing things

591
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,190
but there's kind of some bad news

592
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,990
it's not just about connection speed

593
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,580
anymore so we talked a lot about you

594
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,930
know the Internet's very slow out here

595
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,540
or there's high latency solving

596
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,880
connection is only half of the battle

597
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,860
like solving the performance over the

598
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,320
wire is only a very small fraction of

599
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,110
what we need to do who's got a phone

600
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,520
like this in their pocket this is um

601
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,380
this is an iPhone 7 I never got an

602
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,870
iPhone 7 and it got like a fairly new

603
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,350
Android device yeah yeah I expected that

604
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,150
like most of us have got pretty decent

605
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,770
phones right we're in tech we tend to

606
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,170
update phones fairly frequently and you

607
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,150
know that's good for us lucky us we've

608
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,000
got nice powerful devices unfortunately

609
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,730
this isn't very representative current

610
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,770
advice coming from Google's performance

611
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,840
engineering team is that the most

612
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,200
representative worldwide phone is the

613
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,470
Moto G 4 all right across a global

614
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,900
spectrum the Moto G 4 is probably the

615
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,880
one phone that they say is the best to

616
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,200
optimize for it's the most

617
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,590
representative on a global scale some

618
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,230
really quick sort of comparison shows

619
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,530
that an iPhone 7s roughly twice as fast

620
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,050
in terms of processing power than the

621
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,660
Moto G 4 you immediately get a double

622
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,460
performance benefit just by owning a

623
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,400
certain phone more forensic benchmarking

624
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,530
shows us that in most nearly every

625
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,220
single test the iPhone 7 is 3 to 4 times

626
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,520
more capable than a Moto G 4 so imagine

627
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,140
when you visit a site on your iPhone and

628
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,640
they've got ads everywhere and there's

629
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,110
loads of position:fixed stuff and it's

630
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,240
like scrolling through treacle imagine

631
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,890
making that three to four times slower

632
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,750
all right and that's what people going

633
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,960
to be experiencing you can start

634
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,180
experimenting with this I mean I'm I'm

635
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,400
fairly certain everyone's seen this by

636
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,780
now that opening Chrome we've got these

637
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,150
throttling features the networked one on

638
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,490
the top is alright so who's used the

639
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,590
network throttling in chrome before good

640
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,620
amazing good it's a great start but the

641
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,220
problem with

642
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,750
Network throttling in Chrome as it only

643
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,299
affects the application layer it's very

644
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:21,299
very very synthetic Charles which is

645
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,880
free does this kind of throttling but on

646
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,710
the network layer so it'll actually do

647
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,659
traffic shaping it will do it will

648
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,000
simulate packet loss for example so this

649
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,380
is a great sort but when you install

650
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,669
Charles you will get the network

651
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:34,470
throttling which is way more kind of

652
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,330
realistic but underneath it we can see

653
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,000
CPU slow down diva these have actually

654
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,100
been aliased to kind of like mid-range

655
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,049
device and low rate and high high-end

656
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,990
device in in dev tools but aim for a

657
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,580
five times slowdown and evening it a

658
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,340
fairly decent representation but that

659
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,990
said there is no replacement for real

660
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,980
devices the Moto G 4 is about 150 180

661
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,980
euro I think go and speak to someone at

662
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,240
the company who's got the company credit

663
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,280
card and add one of these moto G force

664
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,450
to your device level this is your

665
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,539
performance testing device I'm a bit of

666
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,650
a hypocrite though I don't actually have

667
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,980
a Moto G 4 I've got a Nexus 5 which is

668
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,470
actually even worse this is from about

669
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,980
five years four or five years ago

670
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,750
the Nexus 5 is even slower than a Moto G

671
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,820
4 so I do most of my performance testing

672
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,090
on this this is a screenshot from an

673
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,100
audit that I sent to a client so this

674
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,750
wasn't actually meant to end up in any

675
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,700
slides this was from a report I sent to

676
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,549
a client they just finished building an

677
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,070
MDOT website it was literally only for

678
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,460
mobile devices and they built it as a

679
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,950
full you know JavaScript client rendered

680
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,049
application and asked me hey how do you

681
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:45,539
make this thing faster don't build it as

682
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:46,620
a fully client rendered JavaScript

683
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,990
application but it's too late by that

684
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,549
point and what we found out is that they

685
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,230
were testing every developer every

686
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,850
engineer had a really nice new metal

687
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,830
book right and they were all on a wired

688
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,990
connection in central London the site

689
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,159
felt really nice and fast

690
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,370
I plugged in my Nexus 5 I visited their

691
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,700
MDOT web site and it took 1.8 seconds

692
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,200
just to evaluate their main act is train

693
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,340
line a client I mentioned at the

694
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,169
beginning point three seconds is worth

695
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:16,409
eight mil to them and we're throwing 1.8

696
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,150
seconds away just evaluating a

697
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,730
javascript file so a processing speed

698
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,490
has a marked impact on performance and

699
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,919
the problem is here this is all divorced

700
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,300
from network speeds if I had mine

701
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,150
five talking to the server over a like a

702
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,280
fiber connection it would still take 1.8

703
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,510
seconds right because this is all

704
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,160
happening on the device so this is what

705
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,110
I mean when I say that connection speeds

706
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,000
only a small fraction of the battle

707
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,480
anymore so yeah build up an idea of

708
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,390
realistic conditions realistic devices

709
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,610
realistic kind of typography is in let

710
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,290
you know what is the network looking

711
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:54,100
like in certain parts of the world and

712
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,720
processing power right these are the

713
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,980
things we need to get a really good

714
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,810
handle on because testing from the

715
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,030
devices that we build on is not suitable

716
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:05,380
anymore step to know what's going on I

717
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,150
told you these weren't simple tips right

718
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,320
it would be so nice for us like I'll

719
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,340
install this and do this and this

720
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,440
plug-in and make your site faster this

721
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,700
is another really difficult one know

722
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,610
what's going on I find myself all the

723
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,180
time

724
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,800
especially when I work with new clients

725
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,410
like what does this script do what is it

726
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,730
what is he what even hits this I've

727
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,950
never seen this before who's in charge

728
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,780
of this who installed this well what's

729
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,910
going on who who lives this whose life

730
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,360
is this slide right only us to man like

731
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,780
I get this all the time I will build a

732
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,430
site or I'll work on a site and I'll put

733
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,050
it live and I look at the live version

734
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,780
and I'd be like whoa I did not do that

735
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,270
where does this come from more release

736
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,860
tracking pixels I didn't install any of

737
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,900
these tracking pixels so what is

738
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,070
happening is other people are

739
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,690
contributing we'll get onto it in a

740
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,660
second but tagger managers for example

741
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,890
other people contributing to your kind

742
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,080
of code base all the time circumventing

743
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,610
the dev process so you end up just

744
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,950
having no idea what any of the files are

745
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,430
on the live product so other people

746
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,130
teams can add things to the site quite

747
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,670
easily not every site I'm mainly talking

748
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,820
like anything ecommerce tag managers

749
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,710
social widgets tracking scripts

750
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,730
retargeting ads all of that kind of crap

751
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,610
in fact ironically things like maybe

752
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,910
testing tools that work on the client or

753
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,500
optimizing tools right these optimizing

754
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,820
tools have this horrible effect of

755
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,650
actually by measuring the site's

756
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,000
performance we're going to making it

757
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,670
slower right which is the painful irony

758
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,960
so yeah if you're in this situation call

759
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,430
meetings try and find out what things

760
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,730
are find out who's using it find out if

761
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,059
they even need it

762
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,649
I've had it so many times when I go into

763
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:44,659
a client and I say oh I notice you're

764
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:46,759
using this analytics package and this

765
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,100
analytics package on the same page why

766
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,110
is that like are we supposed to

767
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,190
uninstall the other one how long's that

768
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,600
been there it's like I don't know just

769
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,179
your website you tell me and it turns

770
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:57,470
out that people that we haven't logged

771
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,090
into this analytics package for like two

772
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,070
years but it's been on the site the

773
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,590
whole time so this is kind of our

774
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,570
responsibility to kind of audit and sort

775
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,059
of work back from this let's talk

776
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:10,909
briefly about tag managers honest honest

777
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:12,679
show of hands who isn't sure what a tag

778
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,179
manager is a few of us so imagine the

779
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:18,710
scenario right you're a developer and

780
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,450
somebody says to you hey can you just

781
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,210
install this little analytics snippet

782
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,700
and you're like I'm kind of busy but

783
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,720
I'll try and do it after lunch so you

784
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,100
quickly do that and you sneak that bit

785
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,960
of work in and it goes live and the next

786
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,190
day they say hey Cheers that was really

787
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,509
great thank you could you just install

788
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:34,159
this bit as well and it's like you can't

789
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,299
keep doing this like I've actually got

790
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:36,850
proper work to do like can you please

791
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,860
prioritize it and and marketing get

792
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,669
annoyed because it's like all the

793
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:41,929
developers won't do what I ask them and

794
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:43,639
you're well I've got work to do already

795
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:45,259
so somebody invented something called a

796
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:47,059
tag manager which is where the developer

797
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,830
gets asked to install just one

798
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,419
javascript file like can you just put is

799
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:51,919
one JavaScript snippet on the site and

800
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,559
this tag manager is like a conduit to

801
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,450
like an admin panel Google tag manager

802
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,210
Adobe tag manager which is basically a

803
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,580
WYSIWYG where marketing departments can

804
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,529
install their own analytics they can

805
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:04,879
install their own tracking scripts and

806
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:06,919
they're right in production JavaScript

807
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:09,139
it's not production quality JavaScript

808
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:10,759
oh no no but is going to production

809
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,279
right they can arbitrarily say let me a

810
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,679
be test this button let me track clicks

811
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,659
on this link let me see how many times

812
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:20,119
the carousel goeb managed to go through

813
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,279
what's happening is you've got people

814
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,169
who are non developers completely

815
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:25,820
skipping the dev process and putting

816
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,639
JavaScript on your live site that's why

817
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:30,080
when you look at the live site and it

818
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,190
looks very very different to what you

819
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,409
actually built this is what happens it's

820
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:34,879
because there are other people able to

821
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:37,009
just add things into production without

822
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:39,649
consulting a developer even once so in

823
00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:42,769
the green box we have the website right

824
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:44,779
this is a company I was working with

825
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,720
recently the green box represents the

826
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,610
website this is what the user turned up

827
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,100
to see the red box

828
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,030
the red box is tracking scripts its

829
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,670
analytics its retargeting its adverts

830
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,980
its it's just

831
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,260
it's disrespect is what that is because

832
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,850
the user didn't want to see any of that

833
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,400
a user did not see and if you're on a

834
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,900
data plan where you're paying for the

835
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,880
data as you use it right you know you're

836
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,920
on a travel sim here in Budapest right

837
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,140
and you've got several euro of data on

838
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,440
your phone you're paying for all it red

839
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,030
so we call it targeting or retargeting

840
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,410
we call an analytics you know but it's

841
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,780
it's kind of just disrespectful right to

842
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,960
force this upon users who don't want it

843
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,350
so that's what tag managers are if

844
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,780
you're running tag managers on your site

845
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,550
or if you don't know if you are or if

846
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,650
you want to know more about it speak to

847
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,240
your marketing team and just ask them

848
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,800
are we doing anything like this to our

849
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,770
users so ya know your liabilities for

850
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,810
years we call them assets but they're

851
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,550
not their liabilities right they've got

852
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,740
a chance of takers offline so third

853
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,240
parties can and will cripple our

854
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,730
performance a client of mine used a

855
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,030
client-side a B testing tool client-side

856
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,800
a/b testing is the devil by the way

857
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,290
don't do it and what it was doing is it

858
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,020
was provide it was contributing 98% of

859
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,080
the runtime overhead so their page 98%

860
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,910
of the runtime overhead was ironically

861
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,070
caused by a tool meant to optimise the

862
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,130
site if you want to find out this kind

863
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,000
of stuff

864
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,190
in in dev tools you wanna go to

865
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,010
performance run a profile bottom up and

866
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,870
then group by domain and it literally

867
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,720
lists which domains which the parties

868
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,970
are causing you the worst performance

869
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,900
problems at runtime so this client weary

870
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,790
platform the entire site we rebuilt the

871
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,410
whole thing and one of our first things

872
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,780
me and the CTO we decided let's take all

873
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,340
the kind of third-party stuff out and

874
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,800
see how things go so we did we ripped

875
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,420
out all the stuff put the site live and

876
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,970
because it was a complete rebuild like

877
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,650
the site didn't look sorry it was a reap

878
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,540
lat forming not a redesign the site

879
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,980
didn't look any different for the users

880
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,870
so we didn't do email campaigns we

881
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,310
didn't tweet about it because there was

882
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,110
nothing new for the users to really see

883
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,270
so what we found out is that purely

884
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,970
organic traffic two weeks after the

885
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:05,190
rebuild the kind of conversions were up

886
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,560
revenue is up items added

887
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,020
that increased time on site had gone

888
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,550
down because if you're an e-commerce

889
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,070
company and you look for a high time on

890
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,440
site you're doing it wrong if you owned

891
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,990
a real life shop and something spent two

892
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,310
hours in your shop and left with one

893
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,200
bottle of water you've you've messed up

894
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,330
right so in an e-commerce build time on

895
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,950
site needs to be low because we don't

896
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,900
want to trap people where to on let them

897
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,140
turn up buy stuff disappear so what end

898
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,790
up happening is the site was really fast

899
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,980
and all metrics were up and the

900
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,360
marketing team were really impressed and

901
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,890
we were glad because we were quite proud

902
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,690
of our work and the marketing team said

903
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,850
can we put an a/b testing tool here to

904
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,160
make it even better and then the CTO

905
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,260
like no no no the only reason it's good

906
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,460
now is because we got rid of all that

907
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,430
crap like please don't don't do that and

908
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,080
they dug their heels in and they said

909
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,300
look we want this tool we need to put it

910
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,390
on the site so end up happening is um

911
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,960
first paint went from 0.8 seconds up to

912
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,240
2.1 is that yeah two point one the a/b

913
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,060
testing tool made the site over twice as

914
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,030
slow right it more than doubled the time

915
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,120
to first render the site got twice as

916
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,010
slow because of ironically adding a tool

917
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,899
isn't meant to optimize it absolutely

918
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,760
heartbreaking we couldn't really win

919
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,440
this fight as soon as you have to do

920
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,399
this kind of stuff you're on the

921
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:20,850
backfoot

922
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,140
but beware of the tools you're using I

923
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,909
need to speed up identifying third

924
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,980
parties then so this is if you've got

925
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,350
Chrome with dev tools experiments

926
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,000
enabled you can find a little thing

927
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,419
called network request groups nice

928
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:38,909
catchy title and what that allows you is

929
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,169
group different things going from third

930
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:43,169
parties you can also turn on a product

931
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,320
column hopefully you can like Chrome

932
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,970
changes so often that sometimes this is

933
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,740
there sometimes it isn't but the product

934
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,419
column will literally start listing

935
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,730
which third parties your site is is

936
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,820
requesting so here's the BBC and we

937
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,770
noticed some oddities we turned the

938
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,900
product column on I hope you can see

939
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,370
we've got things from campaign monitor

940
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,110
things from double-click this really

941
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,640
starts to demystify where all this stuff

942
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,830
is coming from right but also we had a

943
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,100
problem here with a certain third party

944
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,000
had a 35 second TCP connection right and

945
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,460
that was directly linked to the load

946
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,770
events the load event was stalled for 35

947
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,870
seconds which

948
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,400
any other important things that happen

949
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,020
the load event were delayed by half a

950
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,670
minute

951
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,990
and we traced it back to this thing

952
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,150
Rubicon project so identifying third

953
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,860
parties has become a lot easier in dev

954
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,660
tools now by using stuff like this so

955
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,960
yeah being vulnerable third parties can

956
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,180
and will takers offline I mentioned tag

957
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,440
managers they're bad for their own

958
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,630
reasons well there's a specific tag

959
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,470
manager

960
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,780
it's a dhobi tag manager but it's not

961
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,520
specific to Adobe a lot of other third

962
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,160
parties do this but if your third-party

963
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,560
ad code or whatever isn't asynchronously

964
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,750
loaded and that third party has an

965
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,910
outage it can take you offline for one

966
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,280
point three minutes that's Chrome's

967
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,000
built-in timeout so if this retargeting

968
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,550
Kotler ad code kind of tag manager goes

969
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,560
offline we go offline for one point

970
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,320
three minutes it's a complete white

971
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,120
screen that's a complete nothingness for

972
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,720
the user for 80 seconds if you want to

973
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,100
work out how to do this or you want to

974
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,020
audit this yourself stick these IP

975
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,760
addresses or this IP address in your

976
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,830
hosts file basically it's a it's a

977
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,230
publicly available blackhole server any

978
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,220
traffic that goes to any of these

979
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,420
endpoints will actually get routed

980
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,860
through a server where it simulates a

981
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,600
full outage again the slides are online

982
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,820
so don't worry so yeah don't prioritize

983
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,100
prioritize your own metrics over your

984
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,450
users experiences there's no point

985
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,190
having a site where you can measure a

986
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,020
really accurate data but then none of

987
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,690
the users can actually access the site

988
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,450
it's a very fine balancing act and

989
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,350
finally I'm gonna have to really speed

990
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,360
up measure everything measuring

991
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,480
everything tells us two important things

992
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,340
one how do I know what's wrong and two

993
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,190
how do I know when I fixed it most times

994
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,900
when I'm asked to make a company's

995
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,760
website faster they'll just say can you

996
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,990
make the homepage faster but it's not

997
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,460
well okay but how do you know the

998
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,170
homepage is a problem maybe it's a more

999
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,930
important page furthering in the sort of

1000
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,240
search engine forward world the home

1001
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,590
page is very rarely an entry point

1002
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,210
anyway you probably land on a different

1003
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,810
page entirely so analytics who's got

1004
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,750
Google Analytics on their site okay who

1005
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,340
hasn't logged into it for like six

1006
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,460
months yeah I think a lot of you are

1007
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,060
lying

1008
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,860
analytics has got some really great

1009
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,690
information in here you can begin

1010
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,510
exploring things geographically this is

1011
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,070
a really huge gift and it will beach

1012
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,630
ball my machine for a few seconds

1013
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,460
because it's it's kind of it's a bit too

1014
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,300
large but um log into analytics behavior

1015
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,880
site speed page timings will start to

1016
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,800
give you an overview of how your page is

1017
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,330
performed on certain days and you can

1018
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,040
cross-reference that with specific URLs

1019
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,830
specific geographical locales so I work

1020
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,270
this is how I learned about in Nepal

1021
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,610
being a problem area for me and even

1022
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,320
cross-reference ok visitors from this

1023
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,910
country to these pages have a really bad

1024
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,860
time what's different about this page

1025
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,840
than it is about this other page that's

1026
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,340
usually quite fast and you can start to

1027
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,650
identify what the problem might be I've

1028
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,790
done this with clients before and it's

1029
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,310
been really really valuable work the

1030
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,600
tourism company who thought they needed

1031
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,700
to optimize for the UK it turns out

1032
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,870
there are the biggest market was

1033
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,520
Australia and they were the kind of most

1034
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,270
sort of like a little served

1035
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,130
geographical locale you can

1036
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,720
cross-reference that with a specific

1037
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,870
page for specific countries Brazil here

1038
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,970
turns out Brazil is a real problem area

1039
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,500
for me so all of the emerging economies

1040
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,150
we've talked about so far are in the

1041
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,830
East but turns out Brazil is also

1042
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,890
classed as an emerging market in order

1043
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,990
to purchase 500 megabytes of data in

1044
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,580
Brazil you'd have to work for eight

1045
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,920
point six hours on minimum wage that's

1046
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,750
basically a full day's work on minimum

1047
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,700
wage just to purchase five hundred

1048
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,580
megabytes of data I did a little

1049
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,050
comparison I mentioned I've got a

1050
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,090
specific travel sim which I use maybe

1051
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,320
20% of the time so at 20% usage over 18

1052
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,680
months I racked up nearly 15 gig of data

1053
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,530
usage now for a Brazilian person working

1054
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,110
minimum wage on a postpaid data plan to

1055
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,480
purchase 15 gig they would have to work

1056
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,720
28 days that's basically an entire month

1057
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,060
of your year spent working just for your

1058
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,370
data plan so when we send all that stuff

1059
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,900
over with tracking codes with tag

1060
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,200
managers we are literally costing people

1061
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,920
tangible amounts of money um speed curve

1062
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,570
right so I mentioned measuring the

1063
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,730
before measuring the before told me that

1064
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,880
I had a problem in Brazil so what I did

1065
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,410
is I thought well if the before tells me

1066
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,000
that bril Brazil's that I'm going to

1067
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,770
implement a fix I'm gonna measure the

1068
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,480
after so speed curve allows you to

1069
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,359
geographically test

1070
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,099
your sight from different different

1071
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:43,539
parts of the globe

1072
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:45,819
so Brazil icesat-2 monitoring from there

1073
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:47,920
and I just pulled my sight like test

1074
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,420
that every day for three months I think

1075
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,279
this screenshot says and you can quite

1076
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,499
clearly see here that the fixed islands

1077
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:56,499
have had benefit now this is important

1078
00:39:56,499 --> 00:39:57,849
because we could just fix things blind

1079
00:39:57,849 --> 00:39:59,739
in hope it worked and we don't really

1080
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:00,849
know we can't prove that it worked

1081
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:02,619
unless we're measuring absolutely

1082
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:07,180
everything so uhm duplicate slide here

1083
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,859
we can see that something happened

1084
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:10,359
something incredible happened on this

1085
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:13,269
day this is fantastic to take two

1086
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:16,150
clients managers the business whoever is

1087
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,680
you don't need to be technical to

1088
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,480
understand that something very very good

1089
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,239
happened on this day so this is the this

1090
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:24,460
is the sort of major major benefit of

1091
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,380
the before and after is because you can

1092
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,450
start making more business cases say to

1093
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,609
your manager hey look you gave me three

1094
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:32,109
days to fix a performance issue and I

1095
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:34,660
can show you measurably the benefit that

1096
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,509
I had and you can use that set budget so

1097
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:39,940
performance budgets people in management

1098
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,799
don't like the word budget so it's just

1099
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:44,380
kind of like monitoring with alerts I

1100
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,859
set my sights up I kind of you know my

1101
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:50,739
site's fairly typical but I use myself

1102
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,049
as an example because I need to build

1103
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:54,369
faster websites if I'm gonna convince

1104
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,650
clients to pay any money for it so I've

1105
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,890
got my site set up on speed curve also

1106
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,999
and it's like there's not much going on

1107
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:03,670
it's a fairly typical website you'll

1108
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,140
find that I mentioned this earlier in

1109
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,180
Ireland gives it my site it'll be fully

1110
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,700
rendered in 1.2 8 seconds right every

1111
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,499
single day I'm under my allowed budget

1112
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:12,670
I'd only if you can see there's a really

1113
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,999
faint red line running across like here

1114
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:17,289
every single day in Ireland I'm under

1115
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:19,930
budget so I'm doing really well I think

1116
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,460
I'm showing off to a roomful of people

1117
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,480
I'm doing really well fully loaded again

1118
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,359
I'm under budget every single day just

1119
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:29,890
by moving over to Brazil exactly the

1120
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,720
exact same codebase the exact same CD

1121
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,190
and the exact same infrastructure just

1122
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,559
by visiting from Brazil I'm immediately

1123
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,499
paying a penalty about 50% of the time I

1124
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:40,450
go over budget and that's not because

1125
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,980
I've built the site badly it's because

1126
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,529
literally being from Brazil you have to

1127
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:46,869
pay this Geographic penalty where the

1128
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:50,019
internet is not as good for you again

1129
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:51,130
similar story with the fully loaded

1130
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,570
event it still goes over budget

1131
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,640
now this isn't even bad this isn't even

1132
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,490
bad what I did is in speed curve you can

1133
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,740
set up specific profiles so I create a

1134
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,650
profile called very bad Network which is

1135
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,290
a truly terrible network conditioner we

1136
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,140
get 10% packet loss we introduced half a

1137
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,450
second of latency we only get a down

1138
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,790
speed of 150 kilobytes a second and this

1139
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,980
is what a real sort of 2g connection

1140
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,450
feels like this is what it would really

1141
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,240
feel like to be that guy's family in

1142
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,850
India visiting websites over this like

1143
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,630
Android phone in the corner you can

1144
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,640
barely see it but there's my line for my

1145
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,500
budget right this is what I've got to

1146
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,890
play with and you can see that every

1147
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,110
single day I'm at least doubling my

1148
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,840
budget I'm going way over the other

1149
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,980
thing you'll notice is there is almost

1150
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,460
zero consistency hope you can see this a

1151
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,620
lot better this is like your Brazil

1152
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,010
Ireland San Francisco kind of speeds as

1153
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,390
soon as we move to this very bad Network

1154
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,310
this 2g device out in the middle of a

1155
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,010
field there is no consistency you cannot

1156
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,740
plan around this it's very volatile and

1157
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,940
it wasn't as I measured it that I

1158
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,500
realized that can I could look at these

1159
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,480
three lines and think yeah I'm doing a

1160
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,460
pretty good job it wasn't so I measured

1161
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,170
I realized how much work there is left

1162
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,950
to do so apologies I've gone over but in

1163
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,560
closing care like just actually just

1164
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,360
want to do it just want to build a

1165
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,800
faster website it's the easiest way to

1166
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,430
start is actually care about doing it

1167
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,510
understand as much as you can network

1168
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,180
uses their devices their capabilities

1169
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,840
and then measure absolutely everything

1170
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,770
statistics and data you can cross-check

1171
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,660
them it's all true it's all factual I

1172
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,460
just want to say thank you for

1173
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,370
entertaining me for 43 minutes thank you

1174
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:38,940
very much for listening
