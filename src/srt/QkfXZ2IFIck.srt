1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,670

thank you can everybody hear me okay

2
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,400
okay great um thank you all for coming I

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,029
hope you had a nice lunch um so again my

4
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,430
name is Katrina Chaco and I'm an

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,800
engineer at github and I work on Adam

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,040
github free and open source text editor

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,450
but today I'm here to talk to you about

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,530
electron and so can I get a quick raise

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,300
of hands before we start how many of you

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,829
before hearing about this talk had

11
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,950
already heard of electron awesome and

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,010
how many of you have tried building

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,430
something using electron also awesome

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,710
any chance anyone here in the audience

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,500
has tried to use electron to control a

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,060
robot yeah we have one person okay this

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,620
is what we're going to do today I

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,799
brought my trusty assistant bb-8 Sphero

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,860
robot here and he is going to help

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,810
demonstrate some of the fun and

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,009
interesting things that we can do with

22
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,670
electron but first we're going to talk

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,340
about what electron is and how it came

24
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,789
to be so electron is a library that

25
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,890
allows you to build cross-platform

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,710
desktop apps using web technologies

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,609
javascript HTML and CSS and it was born

28
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:32,189
out of github desire to build Adam it's

29
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,670
free and open source text editor and

30
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,659
again this is what I have the pleasure

31
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,689
working on and github decided to build

32
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,780
Adam using web technologies because the

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,389
dream was to build the ultimate tool for

34
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:48,359
writing software so something that was

35
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,090
highly customizable and hackable much

36
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,729
like Emacs and vim but packaged in a

37
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,429
nice beautiful easy-to-use GUI so no

38
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,409
matter where you're at whether it's your

39
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,649
first day writing code or you're an

40
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,469
experienced hacker Adam is designed to

41
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,880
be a tool suited to your needs thus Adam

42
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,430
was written in languages of the web and

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,840
because while native desktop UI

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,300
technologies come and go with time the

45
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,860
web is a standard that becomes more

46
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,550
capable and

47
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,240
buddhist with each passing year so it

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,580
made sense to write adam in a technology

49
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,950
that was approachable and accessible to

50
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,460
many and it would adam was written in

51
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,200
web technologies and open source so that

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,570
anyone could hack on it and get have

53
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,030
realized that the technology used to

54
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,160
enable adam to be built in HTML

55
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,260
Javascript would be useful to other

56
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,700
developers so electron was extracted

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,130
from adam khor and open source does its

58
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,530
own library made available to the public

59
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:07,020
so um electron so electron is a library

60
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,900
that combines chromium which is the main

61
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,230
part of the chrome web browser and

62
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,780
nodejs to allow you to build desktop

63
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,040
apps that run across Mac Windows and

64
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:29,880
Linux and it's a library that and it

65
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,739
aims to make the hard parts of desktop

66
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,560
app development easy like managing

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,040
automatic updates dealing with native

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,940
operating system menus and dialogues

69
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,220
handling crash reporting and profiling

70
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,730
and debugging and if your web developer

71
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,680
you're probably familiar with the pain

72
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,330
of dealing with cross-browser

73
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:56,100
compatibility but with electron all you

74
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,810
need to do is develop for Chrome and you

75
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,540
have an application that works across

76
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,310
platforms and electron is kept very up

77
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,989
to date with the latest versions of

78
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:11,520
chromium so whenever there is a new

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,200
version of chromium the electronic team

80
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,480
works hard to release a new version of

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,330
electron that uses it within a couple

82
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,299
months or so so you get access to all of

83
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,770
the latest and greatest chromium

84
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,919
features you can use most of the es6

85
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,070
features and you also have CSS variables

86
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,320
and source maps they come right out of

87
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,730
the box

88
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,800
and since each electron app window is

89
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,139
just a chrome page you have access to

90
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:41,930
Chrome's powerful debugging tools so

91
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,660
this is Adam and you can see that on the

92
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,720
bottom we have devtools open you can use

93
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,900
the timeline take heap snapshots you can

94
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,990
do interactive debugging and these are

95
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,310
all extremely helpful while building

96
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,050
desktop apps just as they are while

97
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,030
building web apps so as I mentioned

98
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,490
electron is free and open source and

99
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,069
it's being used to build a variety of

100
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:08,960
different types of apps there are

101
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,259
several editors in addition to Adam a

102
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:15,650
brave web browser chat client it's being

103
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,470
used at companies like Microsoft

104
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:23,659
Facebook slack and docker and so now

105
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,060
let's talk a bit about how electron

106
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,220
works we're going to talk about it in

107
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,479
the context of the app that we're going

108
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:34,190
to walk through today so um like I

109
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,960
mentioned today we're going to build an

110
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,380
app that we will use to control bb-8

111
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,030
here and when we start the app the

112
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,699
process that is started is known as the

113
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,430
main process you can think of this as a

114
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,050
typical node process but with additional

115
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,860
electron api's that allow you to control

116
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,300
components of your operating systems you

117
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,520
I so we can do things like add a an icon

118
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,819
to our menu bar and when we click on

119
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:11,030
this icon the main process will then

120
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,080
create a browser window and thus browser

121
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,759
window will have an associated renderer

122
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,000
process and you can think of the render

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,210
process as basically a typical chrome

124
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,270
page but with note integrations built

125
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,150
right into it and you also have other

126
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,310
electron a P is available to you in the

127
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,030
renderer process you can create as many

128
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,659
renderer processes as you like and you

129
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,849
can even create an invisible renderer

130
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,659
process that just execute JavaScript in

131
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:47,240
the background and doesn't affect

132
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,229
performance of your application and in

133
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,750
our app today our main process will also

134
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,400
be connecting with bb-8 through

135
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,870
bluetooth and so now let's take a closer

136
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,840
look at all of these processes like I

137
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,849
mentioned the renderer process is

138
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,240
associated with the UI of our app and

139
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,259
we're just going to have a few buttons

140
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:12,229
it's going to be a menu bar app and when

141
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,569
you click the button then bb-8 is going

142
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,160
to do something fun and entertain us a

143
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,069
bit and so the question is how do the

144
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,259
two processes or the main process and

145
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,419
all the renderer processes interact well

146
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,099
all the process our processes are

147
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:31,400
completely isolated so the only way to

148
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,500
communicate between them is through IPC

149
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,490
or inter process communication so when

150
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,130
we click on the button that tells bb-8

151
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,440
to do a dance we're going to send an IPC

152
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,509
message over to the main process from

153
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,460
the renderer process and then the main

154
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,349
process is going to communicate with

155
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:51,080
bb-8 over bluetooth and have them do a

156
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,840
little dance for us okay so it's time to

157
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,710
look at some code and first off I want

158
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,360
to mention that all of the code is

159
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,870
already up on github it's a repo under

160
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,740
my user name KO Chaco and you can feel

161
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,810
free to take a look at this and you can

162
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,430
look at the commit history to see how

163
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,530
the progression of how the app was built

164
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,800
and use it as a way to familiarize

165
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,509
yourself with electron maybe help you

166
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,069
get started with building your own fun

167
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:27,560
electron apps so I've got Adam fired up

168
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,909
and for the sake of time I'm going to be

169
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:34,849
checking out commits that I've tagged

170
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,349
and we're going to be taking a look at

171
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,839
the code I've aliased my get check out

172
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,029
is GC oh we're going to start out with

173
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:46,430
hello a commit tagged hello and we start

174
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,860
out as we would any node program with a

175
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,350
package.json and we've got some

176
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,209
dependencies that i've already installed

177
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,660
and a start script that runs the elect

178
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,720
the bundled electron binary and we pass

179
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,860
it the path

180
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,310
of this project and when electron starts

181
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,370
it looks in your package.json to figure

182
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,930
out what the entry point of your app is

183
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,510
an arse is file called mange is so it

184
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,220
takes this code and it runs it in the

185
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:22,190
main process and our main GS code right

186
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,900
now is pretty simple it's the simplest

187
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,790
electron app that you can conceive of

188
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,820
your typical hello world type of app you

189
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,130
can see that we're using es6 here no

190
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,290
trans piling we just get it right out of

191
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,270
the box because we're using the latest

192
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:40,010
version of chromium and so we've got

193
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,660
known and we've also got electron api's

194
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,620
and so the app module controls the

195
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,380
applications event lifecycle and you

196
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,230
emits a ready event one the app when

197
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,590
electron has finished initializing so

198
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,630
when the app is ready we're going to

199
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,640
create a window and we're going to use

200
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,360
the browser window API and specify the

201
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,980
dimensions that we want the window to be

202
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,980
and load our HTML so here we've created

203
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,650
a renderer process from our brows render

204
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,960
process from our main process and if we

205
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,530
look at that index dot HTML it simply

206
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,840
says hello world for now and we're

207
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,300
printing out versions of node and

208
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,920
chromium and electron that we're using

209
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,650
and you'll notice that embedded in our

210
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,190
HTML we have node we have access to all

211
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,750
of nodes built in modules and AP is we

212
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,330
also have access to any module that's up

213
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,780
any of the 330,000 packages that are up

214
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:50,090
on NPM and this is really powerful if we

215
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,130
look at what's in renderer j/s right now

216
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,580
simply console.log that says hello from

217
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,250
the dev tools we're going to start up

218
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,350
this app with mm p.m. start then we have

219
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,160
it we have a simple desktop app and you

220
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,020
can pop up in the dev tools we see our

221
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,260
hello from the dev tools and and you can

222
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,260
see that

223
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,110
with very little we've got an electron

224
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,360
app up and running if you already are

225
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,910
familiar with web technologies and node

226
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,600
you can get to this point really quickly

227
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,190
so the next step is we're going to turn

228
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,550
this into a menu bar app and I'm going

229
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:35,730
to check out another commit and now in

230
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,070
our main process code we're also going

231
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,960
to use a tray module provided by

232
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,300
electron and this this module will place

233
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,170
an icon in our menu bar so on Mac it's

234
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,180
going to be on the top right if I was on

235
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,470
a Windows machine it would be on the

236
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,580
bottom right and we're going to use this

237
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,160
electron positioner module to place our

238
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,820
browser window right underneath the icon

239
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,960
what I want to point out about this is

240
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,060
this is actually a third-party module is

241
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,670
created by someone out in the community

242
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,560
it's not created by an electron team

243
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,670
member and like Adam is open sourced and

244
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,340
has a thriving open source community

245
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,460
electron does as well and there are a

246
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,310
lot of great packages out there electron

247
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,710
actually has over 400 open-source

248
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,820
contributors at this point so we're

249
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,060
going to use this awesome module I think

250
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,100
it's made by yawns and Sweden and now

251
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,050
when our app is ready we're instead of

252
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,430
creating window we're going to create a

253
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,000
tray icon will pass the path to the icon

254
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,660
and when we click on the the icon we're

255
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,100
going to toggle the visibility of our

256
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,250
window an electron provides us the tray

257
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,930
bounds so that we know exactly where on

258
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,310
the screen the icon is and we can

259
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,500
position our window accordingly so we'll

260
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,080
pass those through down to show window

261
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,410
and use the positioner module to

262
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,780
calculate the position to set our main

263
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,660
window at and then we'll show the window

264
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,070
and focus it and now when we create our

265
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,840
window in addition to specifying the

266
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,240
dimensions we're also going to indicate

267
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,770
that we want it to be hidden at first

268
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,220
and we want it to be frameless and we

269
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,860
won't be allowing the user to fullscreen

270
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
the window

271
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,090
or resize it and when we click away from

272
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,410
the window and we get the blur event

273
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,130
we're going to hide it and lastly we're

274
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,870
going to hide the dock icon that would

275
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,640
normally appear on a Mac so let's start

276
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,690
this up again and you can see now we

277
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,380
have a little bb-8 icon up in our menu

278
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,160
bar and we can click on him to toggle

279
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,950
the visibility and still the dev tools

280
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,560
so you'll notice that i restarted the

281
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,070
app entirely and one thing to recognize

282
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,500
is when you're working with electron

283
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,630
apps if you change any of the code in

284
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,420
your main process code you're going to

285
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,030
need to restart the app entirely this is

286
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,050
because that code is loaded into memory

287
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,730
upon initialization when you first start

288
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,670
electron or as if we'd only changed code

289
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,130
in the renderer process then all we

290
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,260
would need to do is refresh to see those

291
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,440
changes as is the case with any web page

292
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,590
so now we have a menu bar app it's

293
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,440
pretty plain so we're going to throw

294
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,860
some styles at it and I'll check out

295
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,950
another commit and now when we click on

296
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,180
the app will see that we've turned our

297
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,400
hello world app into a Hello bb-8 app so

298
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,640
we want to do bb-8 justice here okay so

299
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,010
now the exciting part we're going to

300
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,290
hook everything up so that when we click

301
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,830
a button on our UI that ultimately ends

302
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,850
up and bb-8 here doing a little dance so

303
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,080
and if you recall we communicate between

304
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,120
processes through IPC so now we've added

305
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,930
a button in our index dot HTML and has

306
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,330
an ID of dance and in our render process

307
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,640
code we add a listener that uses the IPC

308
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,050
renderer module that we get from

309
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,620
electron and we send a dance message

310
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,480
over to the main process

311
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,370
and in our main process code once the

312
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,079
app is ready now we're going to use the

313
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,690
APC main module from electron and when

314
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,089
we receive the dance message will have

315
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,209
bb-8 do a dance so now the question is

316
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:59,500
how do we hook up bb-8 and for that

317
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,250
we'll check out another commit so bb-8

318
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,940
here is built by Sphero and Sphero has a

319
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,290
handy node module that we use it uses a

320
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,190
bluetooth library called noble and all

321
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,130
we need to do is pass the UID of bb-8

322
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,399
and we have this bb-8 object that we can

323
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,399
use to control the robot I've also

324
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,459
created a separate file bb-8 commands

325
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,870
that has all the commands that will be

326
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,510
using today and now when the app is

327
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,260
ready we're going to connect to bb-8 and

328
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,880
put something to console and have them

329
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,320
change a random color just so that we

330
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,490
know he's awake and now when we get the

331
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,500
dance message we're going to call our

332
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,680
dance command and we'll take a look at

333
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,870
that so it's pretty simple it just sets

334
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,569
a couple of intervals and has bb-8 role

335
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:58,420
in a random for random distance in a

336
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,970
random direction and change a random

337
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,880
color and we also want to play some

338
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,089
music for bb-8 to dance to so we're

339
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:14,260
going to use the Audio API and we're

340
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,169
going to send a sound message to our

341
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,630
render process and the name of the file

342
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,900
the sound file that we want to play so

343
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,660
again we're using IPC sending sound to

344
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,549
the main process or the renderer process

345
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:31,090
and when we receive that message and the

346
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,830
name of our audio file we're going to

347
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:41,350
play the song okay so now comes the

348
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,440
moment of truth see if we can get bb-8

349
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,919
to dance for us but first since bb-8 is

350
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,330
so small I brought a webcam so that

351
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,130
everyone can get a better

352
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,650
you of his dance moves and I have

353
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,750
another menu bar app that was created

354
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,420
specifically for this presentation it's

355
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,980
another electron app that uses WebRTC to

356
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,540
display the feed from a given webcam so

357
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,940
hopefully y'all can see you bb-8 better

358
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:24,010
now and I'll stick this down here okay

359
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,430
now for the moment of truth pray to the

360
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,530
demo gods but this works wait for bb-8

361
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,250
to connect and there we go and we see

362
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,370
he's turned a pretty blue and he's ready

363
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:45,120
for some dance moves okay so now let's

364
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,230
we see that we have our dance button and

365
00:18:49,230 --> 00:19:03,060
when we click it

366
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:08,390
thank you haha all right so you can see

367
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,530
that pretty quickly we were able to

368
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,450
throw some code together and control

369
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,809
bb-8 here and we can have them do more

370
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:22,610
than just dance so check out another

371
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:31,000
commits and start the app so we can also

372
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,030
turn bb-8 into a disco bb-8 ball have

373
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,299
them change some pretty colors and spin

374
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:46,890
around for us

375
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,580
and we can also use bb-8 as a magic bb-8

376
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,770
ball and for those of you who aren't

377
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,900
familiar with magic eight balls they're

378
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,000
basically these toys they're kind of for

379
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,840
fortune-telling and you can ask them

380
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,490
simple yes or no questions and shake

381
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,120
them and they'll give you a response so

382
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,690
we can ask bb-8 questions like BBA do

383
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,570
you think that will have any luck seeing

384
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,720
the northern lights tonight and see if

385
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,220
he says yes or no oh hello okay he's not

386
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,350
very optimistic um but we can be helpful

387
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,290
let's see a let's ask him bb-8 are you

388
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:36,860
having fun today oh hello huh um okay

389
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,450
maybe after this next portion you'll be

390
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,040
having fun let's see if we can get him

391
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,600
to say yes because I want you to hear

392
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,370
that yeah okay um so magic bb-8 ball and

393
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,900
lastly there's a way for you all to

394
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,850
interact with bb-8 by tweeting at him

395
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,330
and I'll let you I'll tell you exactly

396
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,890
how if you want to take out your phones

397
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,500
tweet out of him one lucky tweeter is

398
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,150
going to get a free github shirt so a

399
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,030
little extra incentive there and we're

400
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,520
going to take a look at this code before

401
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,220
we do this so we're going to be using

402
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,420
the twitter api we have it's a twitter

403
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,020
npm module and i have code that will get

404
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,240
me a random tweet and if you tweet at

405
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,620
bb-8 will be looking for tweets with a

406
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,080
hashtag bb-8 electron all one word

407
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,520
lowercase so tweet at bb-8 and you can

408
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,570
either ask them to dance or disco and

409
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,880
once we get a tweet with a hit he will

410
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,270
do the thing that was said and will also

411
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,140
be displaying a desktop notification

412
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,090
that says the name or the user name of

413
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,530
the person that tweeted and shows their

414
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:59,360
profile picture and so go ahead

415
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,660
tweet now we'll give it a bit because it

416
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,340
does take some time for the tweets to

417
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,210
come through and I'll get the webcam

418
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:15,770
back up so we can still see bb-8 okay so

419
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,570
I'm going to click the button now it's

420
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,309
going to give another like 10 seconds so

421
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:24,470
you still have time and actually first

422
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,640
I'm going to turn my notifications back

423
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,200
on otherwise we will not see the

424
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,010
notification that comes through oh also

425
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,830
let's take a look there so the way that

426
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,169
we display the notification is we use

427
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:38,900
the html5 notification API which we only

428
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,610
have access to in the renderer process

429
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,280
so what we need to do is from our main

430
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,169
process code send the information about

431
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:49,450
the tweet to the renderer process and

432
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,049
when we get this tweet found message

433
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,850
we're going to use the notification API

434
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:03,830
so another instance of IPC alright so I

435
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,299
think we have some tweets in and let's

436
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:13,010
see what we get a little bit more time

437
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,480
so more time to get treats in if you

438
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:25,510
want

439
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:35,159
and the winner is Ehlert's mari that's a

440
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:47,549
disco all right and there we go um so I

441
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:49,919
will get you all tweet back at you and

442
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,149
let you know how you get your free

443
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:55,440
github t-shirt so that's it for the bb-8

444
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,470
show today thank you all for coming and

445
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,360
i'll throw another slide up with the

446
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,120
resources with a list of resources in

447
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,130

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:11,100
