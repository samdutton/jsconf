00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370

the remarkable thing about note comp is

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,220
that it's always been the right thing

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,259
for the community at the right time this

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,730
is the first one I've been to and it's

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,110
fantastic you know I thought it was

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,840
going to be a like a summer camp style

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,849
event but it's a real summer Katrina you

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,770
can hear you can hear and see children

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,600
behind us there at camp right now if

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,560
we're just hanging out having a

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,529
conference is incredible I had I had

12
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,330
given up on conferences maybe six or

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,910
seven years ago the format doesn't work

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,460
for me you see it through a couple days

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,859
of presentation is usually five minutes

16
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,149
of the presentation I'm thinking about

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,239
something else from answering emails it

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,180
really surpassed my expectations the

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,829
fact that every every organized session

20
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,559
was hands-on the fact that every session

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,940
your meeting at people you sitting next

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,480
to somebody you're working with

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,850
so you're learning by doing as opposed

24
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,489
to listening and you're also getting to

25
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:55,960
know the people around you by working

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,940
with them as opposed to just talking

27
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,890
over a beer and then at the end of the

28
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,570
whole day you know there's all the

29
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,739
talking over the beer and around the

30
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,690
campfire and you know you can swap your

31
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,860
war stories because you're all working

32
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,900
on the same project at different kinds

33
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,970
or you know people are bragging about

34
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,110
the hacks they did and stuff like that

35
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,420
so

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,110
I got something substantial out of every

37
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,290
single session volunteer the ability to

38
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,550
have my family here in a really easy way

39
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,790
as this campground I brought my wife and

40
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,280
two kids and they really enjoyed it had

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,570
a lot of fun and I've got to hang out

42
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,210
with them in between sessions and

43
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,830
getting some lunches and things and

44
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,610
during the free diamond easily when my

45
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,090
favorite conferences it's just this

46
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,800
about community it's that family it's

47
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,180
about really cares about what wear this

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,399
like we just going and we want to do

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,920
with it and what can we do with it

50
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,850
and just seeing where it at work crowd I

51
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,190
think what's unique about no cop really

52
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,430
is that Michael really cares a lot about

53
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,700
doing a really good job and putting on

54
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,080
something really interesting that kind

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,390
of brings the community to get together

56
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,080
so yeah this this time was definitely

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,900
really really fantastic I mean having

58
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,490
everybody here I'd like in like

59
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,790
workshops you know to do something that

60
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,920
they thought they couldn't do in each

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,450
one of the sessions I think was really

62
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,530
impressive and you know I think a lot of

63
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,660
people like actually accomplished

64
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,650
something you know usually when you go

65
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,390
to a conference you like you get kind of

66
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,430
inspired yeah that's really cool and

67
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,930
then you go home and you take a nap and

68
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,600
you never don't think about so this time

69
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,160
I mean people are actually like getting

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:58,000
their hands dirty with stuff
