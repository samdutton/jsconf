00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:14,040

hi everyone my name is tobias funke lips

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,500
time and I'm working for a company

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,160
called uke Cebu and what we are doing

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,480
we're developing mobile applications

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,720
with the open web technologies and i

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,360
will show you today what we did the last

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,050
year and i want to show you an

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,719
application that we pushed to several

9
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,230
devices and as you can see here on this

10
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,420
picture already we have a simple

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,350
application that we push to the all

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,110
these devices there you have for example

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,539
a blackberry device you have a Windows

14
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,870
Mobile you have and this is a vodafone

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,100
device and also palm pre and all others

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,580
and i will show you our experience we

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,979
had with developing for all these

18
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,400
different platforms and yes version 1 is

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
mobile sorry windows mobile it's worse

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,250
than 6.5 so yeah all other versions

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,990
before you don't want to support yeah so

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,439
but before I really start into

23
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,229
explaining how we did that i want to

24
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,500
show you more the landscape of the

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,680
mobile world and its really really

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,610
blurry at the moment and here for

27
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,710
example you see there is a weapon you

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,130
can't with the URL but this is a website

29
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,530
that is listing all the app stores that

30
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,500
are available and in july two thousand

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,020
nine there were 14 stores where you can

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,700
place your weapon and in September 2009

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,459
it already were 23 stores and I looked

34
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,120
it up yesterday and we already are we

35
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,100
already have

36
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,100
for stores where we can or where we have

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,740
to push our apps too if we want to reach

38
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,270
all the devices so when you want to

39
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,540
write applications for all these devices

40
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,900
it's really hard to do that if you do it

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,600
natively so here for example for the

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,510
iphone you have to learn objective-c for

43
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,670
the nokia devices you have to learn

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,140
symbian c and this is going on and it's

45
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,810
really a pain if you have to use all

46
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,090
this programming language just to build

47
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,320
one in the same app so in this going on

48
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,090
but there's HTML and it's yeah it's the

49
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,370
engine of the web and why we've chosen

50
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,680
HTML was mainly because yeah there are

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,920
so many depths out there and it's there

52
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,040
the potential to write applications for

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,430
mobile devices with this open technology

54
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,850
is really there are so many people doing

55
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,810
that then it's also really easy to write

56
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,150
yeah it's common easy to test will have

57
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,070
all the test tools already there with

58
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,670
file back and all everything and we have

59
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,670
a standard for that and yeah widely

60
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,810
spread so when did all that stuff

61
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,640
started with with the airpipe I think it

62
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,040
started with the iphone and what the

63
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,590
iphone already came out with wasn't

64
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,710
really impressive browser and where you

65
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,850
can do really impressive things and this

66
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,090
is a comment by tony allen is a mobile

67
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,780
analyst and he's saying that seventy one

68
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,160
percent of all phones have a more modern

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,380
XHTML web browser what is meaning by

70
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,360
that is that there are also some

71
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,270
browsers out there that just support the

72
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,110
wa p standard but at least seventy one

73
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,540
percent that's really huge huge amount

74
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,510
of mobile phones that support or have a

75
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,160
good browser so yeah here's the comment

76
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,760
it so and one other interesting thing

77
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,650
we've seen is there's a company who is

78
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,160
building apps that have that aren't

79
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,570
allowed to get into the app store

80
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,690
because of their topic they want to

81
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,140
present and they really have an interest

82
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,570
in concept how they get around the App

83
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,750
Store so basically it's just that you go

84
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,540
through a URL and what they are showing

85
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,110
is really like an animated gif showing

86
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,720
okay here press the plus sign and add it

87
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,970
to your home screen and when you add it

88
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,130
to your own home screen it these this

89
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,700
application really feels like like like

90
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,380
a native application there's no

91
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,930
difference anymore what they also did of

92
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,150
course is here in that case they

93
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,970
implement their own payment system so it

94
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,500
was just a pop-up way and your credit

95
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,270
card information and then it's

96
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,160
installing an app for you but it's all

97
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,370
based on HTML CSS and JavaScript nothing

98
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:31,310
natively so once again here HTML works

99
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,790
really everywhere and it's really it's a

100
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,480
low-hanging fruit to support all to use

101
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,610
HTML to write applications with that so

102
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,830
you I think you wonder about the the

103
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,200
topic of that talk about what is what is

104
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,270
an html5 app and I will try to explain

105
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,190
all the different standards out there

106
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,790
and what I mean by calling apps that run

107
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:07,130
on html5 or HTML or coined that that

108
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,620
term so what we did to ride event ninja

109
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,300
this this was our first website and we

110
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,520
wanted to have a spot where we show all

111
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,950
events we are attending the next time

112
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,700
and we thought yeah it would be a good

113
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,970
idea to just place it on a mobile device

114
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,210
and have it available there of course

115
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,940
you can say yeah you can just link it to

116
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,300
a website but then it's not

117
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,960
easy accessible as you went as you place

118
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,860
it in an app store so the question is

119
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,129
how we did that so there are different

120
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:52,729
types of apps that that can be on a

121
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:55,039
device they can be pre-installed they

122
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,550
can be native apps that we're pushed in

123
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,180
an app store you can have a website

124
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,830
where you have your application running

125
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,349
but of course when you have it on a

126
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:10,819
website the capabilities to access

127
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:13,069
native functionalities on the phone are

128
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,289
really limited so it just can access for

129
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,169
example geolocation on the iphone and

130
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:21,190
the S or no you can't get the estimator

131
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,229
but it's really not as much as you want

132
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,289
or you can do more with that and there

133
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:34,520
are html5 apps and the XS for for the

134
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,190
furthermore of all the device specific

135
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,680
features are of course depending on the

136
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,419
run time I think you all heard about

137
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,270
phonegap and it's allowing access to

138
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,300
more functionalities on the phone and i

139
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,279
will show you some other things that

140
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,719
also enable of access to some Native

141
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:02,719
functionalities so I go into detail so

142
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:05,210
here's the device what we have there

143
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,610
it's really it's basically you have in

144
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,099
something like an index.html you have a

145
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:12,979
simple style a style sheet and then you

146
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,610
have any I ex-library out there and you

147
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,219
have a database that is feeding these

148
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:24,889
events and what you then do is you sip

149
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,279
it up you see all the files up and what

150
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,199
you then place in is in configuration

151
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,760
file a config xml and you add an icon

152
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,620
and this is what you get out of there

153
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,550
it's a w3c widget it's standardized so

154
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,820
it standardized how you can pack HTML

155
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,690
CSS JavaScript together and deploy it on

156
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,130
several devices

157
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,880
and you can really just pick that w3c

158
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,580
this zip file you created and put it

159
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,220
into opera and test it there if you want

160
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,410
to because they have a native runtime

161
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,990
for w3c witches so then you're ready for

162
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,440
that and can use it so can you really

163
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,500
use the w3c widget already on any phone

164
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,460
phone so yeah you can there are some

165
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,750
devices that have these native

166
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,170
capabilities to run w3c with widgets so

167
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,740
one is this is a Vodafone device that is

168
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,680
that already has that functionality on

169
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,900
board so you just can send a widget w3c

170
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,000
widget to that device and you can run it

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,450
there so yeah and of course you have

172
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,840
HTML native support on the palm pre but

173
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,520
the packaging there is completely

174
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,500
different so I will go into that later

175
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,660
so yeah you have these native

176
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,010
capabilities but palm really is not the

177
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,140
not supporting the w3c widget yet I

178
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,180
don't know what their plan is to support

179
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,450
that then you have native support on

180
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,400
Android nokia with the Opera runtime

181
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,590
there's a w3c widget runtime from opera

182
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,950
and you just have to install or you can

183
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,230
install it on nuclear several nokia

184
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,690
devices and also an android and

185
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:25,590
meanwhile i think also on windows mobile

186
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,880
so here you see these are all devices

187
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,530
that already support w3c widgets and

188
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,720
interesting is that Microsoft started to

189
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,860
support w3c widgets since windows mobile

190
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,020
6.5 so you also just have to pick your

191
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,330
widget file and place it on a device and

192
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,520
you can also place it in any app store

193
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,000
and the same is for the blackberry

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,660
device since blackberry operating system

195
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,430
five-point oh you can also place w3c

196
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,490
which it's there

197
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,959
so yeah and of course the iphone and

198
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,209
palm tree and i really have the best

199
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:16,750
HTML support yeah and if you use that

200
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,779
technology to write a w3c widget what

201
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,690
you get really for free is a Facebook

202
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,580
widget if you want to write that

203
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,640
dashboard widget website widget TV

204
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,589
widget opera for example are I've seen

205
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,990
it at the mwc conference they showed an

206
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,220
opera runtime that is running on a TV or

207
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,610
wec runtime and its really really

208
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,149
interesting just to get just HTML CSS

209
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:51,520
JavaScript on every device that is out

210
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,200
there that it has a screen so yeah here

211
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,420
this is a widget runtime on the bottom

212
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,089
and also here on our website we're using

213
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:03,990
that we use it on a DOTA campus side and

214
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,850
here it's running on an iphone so but

215
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,020
also what i mentioned before about

216
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,020
native functionalities a phone is also

217
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,300
like it's a camera you have a camera on

218
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,270
on nearly every device you have

219
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,730
compassed sometimes you have a calendar

220
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,360
that you use and a lot more native

221
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,290
functionalities you want to use when you

222
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,130
want to when you write your app so there

223
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,250
are really multiple ways to get that

224
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,940
native functionalities into your w3c

225
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,579
widget or any other packaging solution

226
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:46,899
that is out there so there's there's

227
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,620
free i would say competing specs out

228
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,740
there there's a consortium called Jill

229
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,420
that are defining aspect how to or they

230
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,170
they have written a spec how to access

231
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,320
native functionalities from JavaScript

232
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,890
and also there's another consortium they

233
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,750
also started to implement that it's

234
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,250
funny to see that and and I don't

235
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,690
understand why they don't really

236
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,490
work together and they're also defining

237
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,140
a standard for that and there's

238
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,610
meanwhile a w3c group that is trying to

239
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,780
go and get all that api's out there and

240
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,520
bring it together to a good standard and

241
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,860
what we also have is of course phonegap

242
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,990
they have their own standard how they

243
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:47,230
access functionalities from from there

244
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,290
on time so these are all and also nokia

245
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,430
wrt polym webos they all defined their

246
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,280
own api for the same thing it's not it's

247
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,380
always just about I want to get access

248
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,680
to the camera I want to see what the

249
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,640
estimator is and all these things and

250
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,110
I've written down below there's also

251
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,540
Google Chrome OS I think they also will

252
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,280
have something like native

253
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,220
functionalities they want to use and may

254
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,670
I hope so that they they use any

255
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,560
standard standard that is already

256
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,100
existing and as you can see it's really

257
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,690
getting complex if you want to right now

258
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,680
an application even if its HTML in HTML

259
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,300
application and that is using just

260
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,020
making a picture with your app so I hope

261
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,020
in the future we will collaborate more

262
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,440
together and find a way or a good API

263
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,140
for accessing native functionalities so

264
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,050
when you really look at that which

265
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,430
platforms or phones support the

266
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,370
different standards as you can see w3c

267
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,560
spec is supported by a nokia runtime

268
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,050
then of course nokyo wrt they have that

269
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,540
standards in several years it's also

270
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,900
running on a nokia s60 device then

271
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,080
there's appcelerator they support

272
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,120
currently iphone android I don't know

273
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,460
how far they are with blackberry but I

274
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,620
think soon they will have something like

275
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,120
that then of course yeah phonegap

276
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,850
bonilla be supporting a lot of devices

277
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,660
and maybe it's the right way to

278
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,330
to program applications now and use

279
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,000
their existing API because they already

280
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,850
support so many devices and I don't know

281
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,260
what phonegap is doing to work together

282
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,080
with one night or jill but i think we

283
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,460
will see that in the future so but what

284
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,980
is interesting about phone game is that

285
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,480
their goal is that they are not existent

286
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,700
so this is what we really should aim for

287
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,600
that we just can access that api or this

288
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,340
packaging that it's phonegap is doing

289
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,180
and that it's easily working and less

290
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,730
complex as is now so but yeah you you

291
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,760
see a table I think it's half a year ago

292
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,140
they already supported all the features

293
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,310
on the iphone they wanted to support and

294
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,550
here for the Android the context support

295
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,580
was missing and since yeah it's open

296
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,600
source you see the blackberry the

297
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,920
BlackBerry device is now better

298
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,690
supported and you can get an HTML html5

299
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,940
app also on blackberry with the phonegap

300
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,720
wrapper so and here are more there's a

301
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,070
table what they also support for native

302
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,540
capabilities and this will all will

303
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,280
change more in the future and we will

304
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,150
see which devices will support which

305
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,320
feature so what also is interesting to

306
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,500
see how big such an application is and

307
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,480
we took our event ninja application and

308
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,030
in total the file that we place in the

309
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,700
app store was a 300 kilobyte and our

310
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,720
JavaScript HTML and CSS was 120 k and if

311
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,340
you subtract that you really just have a

312
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,210
footprint of 200 to 40k for phonegap so

313
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,910
it's really really small so you can

314
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,320
imagine that you can install a lot of

315
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,960
phone web applications on an iPhone or

316
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,250
an Android device so now I will talk a

317
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,140
little bit about the our application

318
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,179
event ninja and just to show you how we

319
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:48,470
that and what the focus focus law was so

320
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,119
once again the w3c widget standard and

321
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,399
we have an external database and our

322
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:59,090
external database there we saved our

323
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,009
events that we show in our application

324
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:04,669
and here you see it's really just

325
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,669
basically a google calendar that we've

326
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,009
chosen with we said we don't want to

327
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:14,059
write a calendar again and just picked

328
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,179
up a google calendar and filled our

329
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:23,059
dates in there and and then we really

330
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:25,940
just packaged it up and brought it on

331
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,820
the different devices so here this is a

332
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,369
nokia device with a different look and

333
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:34,159
feel then this is running on windows

334
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,190
mobile with an iphone look and this is

335
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,950
palm OS with a different layout and it

336
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,919
really just was too yeah mainly fixing

337
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,929
browser box between all these different

338
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:48,590
devices and of course we used a lot of

339
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,110
CSS features to make the skinning

340
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,039
different for each device and here for

341
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,190
example blackberry device then on

342
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,240
android and on the iphone so and then

343
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,519
what we then want to accomplish to see

344
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,840
where we could push these apps too and

345
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,309
here you see a list of all the app

346
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:14,450
stores we pushed our app to and for

347
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,179
example here you see also here devices

348
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:20,409
that are supported or where we tested

349
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,570
event ninja on and it's really a lot of

350
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,110
effort to send the application on the

351
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,379
device tested then you find on a problem

352
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,649
and do that again it's it's really a lot

353
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:40,149
of work and here you can see also that

354
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:42,440
getting into all the app stores it was a

355
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,259
manual task it wasn't like there's no

356
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,940
automation out there where you just

357
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,429
place your application to and then it

358
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,649
sends it to all the app stores and also

359
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,710
it was a large expense to get into all

360
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,909
these eps tours like I

361
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:58,619
everyone knows for the ex store you have

362
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:02,450
to pay ninety nine dollars each year to

363
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,220
get your apps into the app store then

364
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,299
the funniest thing i think was windows

365
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,710
mobile there you charge your account

366
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,460
with 50 euros and every time you push

367
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,059
your app to their quality assurance you

368
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,039
have to pay or it 15 euros are

369
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,109
subtracted from your account so after

370
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:28,559
three submissions you have to do it

371
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,929
again and sometimes you you get feedback

372
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,210
like it's not working then you say okay

373
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,580
why is that working and it's really

374
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:41,099
ridiculous and you see again this charge

375
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,309
from this demo which app stores so we

376
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,409
pushed our rap too and I think it's not

377
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:48,599
so difficult to get into more app stores

378
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:51,269
but really it's not worth the money to

379
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:56,070
to get into all of those so what really

380
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,220
felt was was hard with developing for

381
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,200
all these different devices and we're

382
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,570
not just talking about high-end devices

383
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,820
like iphone and android we're also

384
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,669
talking about blackberry and windows

385
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,710
mobile and nokia devices they don't have

386
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,849
so much power so what really was the

387
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,099
pain was supporting all these different

388
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:19,529
browsers it's not true that we just have

389
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,320
WebKit if we have WebKit we have a lot

390
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,359
of different webkinz the android webkit

391
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,149
is completely different to an iphone web

392
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:29,629
kit and the palm WebKit is different and

393
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:34,019
then we also have the browser of rim the

394
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:38,099
blackberry from the BlackBerry device

395
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,840
then we have fennec maybe in the future

396
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,609
I don't know how many devices will ship

397
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:44,429
fennec in the future then I think large

398
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,450
is also opera and opera mini opera mini

399
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,590
for example also has widget runtime so

400
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,749
but the difference here for opera mini

401
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:57,659
is that javascript is executed on the

402
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,690
server so what just is possible with

403
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,559
opera mini is that you can can write

404
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,349
code that is using click events or mouse

405
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:09,359
down Eva and something like that so then

406
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,650
you can write apps for that

407
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,360
but if you want to have more like

408
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,360
animations and dynamic staff that

409
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,730
doesn't work and also bold it's

410
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,520
something similar like opera mini they

411
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,200
also have a widget runtime oh and I

412
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,110
forgot ie there's also I windows mobile

413
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,500
and they have a widget runtime and it's

414
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,710
also funny they brought out windows

415
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,450
mobile 6.5 about half a year ago and

416
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,040
they have a strange mixture in the

417
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,950
browser they have a rendering engine of

418
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,560
ie6 and a JavaScript runtime of IE eight

419
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,510
so it's really hard to distinguish what

420
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,070
is then used and what I've heard the new

421
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,100
windows mobile seven will have an IE

422
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,730
seven so at least a little bit better

423
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,010
but I don't know what they will do but

424
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,080
at least the Opera runtime is always

425
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,380
running on on windows mobile so you can

426
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,750
just place an overrun time there and be

427
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,040
happy so yeah there's also not much more

428
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,050
pain we're in the mobile space we have

429
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,960
to handle touching key events that we

430
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,720
don't have to care about so much on the

431
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,020
desktop browser and yeah this is a big

432
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,480
big pain that we have to support several

433
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,320
different screen sizes if you now look

434
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,540
at the ipad you really have large screen

435
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,700
sizes and I think it's not just

436
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,380
sufficient to pump up or to zoom into

437
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,540
that application I think you also have

438
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,640
to give a different experience on every

439
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,200
device that has a different screen size

440
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,560
so we have to think about what we will

441
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,790
how we will handle that so and as you've

442
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,520
seen the packaging and deployment to all

443
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,050
these different app stores it's really

444
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,990
complex and I it's a lot of work do that

445
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,950
so it could be really painful and

446
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,380
performance is a big big issue and you

447
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,180
really have to be careful what

448
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,140
JavaScript functionality you use

449
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,030
to write your application and Costa code

450
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,290
size really matters if you deploy your

451
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:34,840
html5 app on earn one on web server it's

452
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,190
really dependent all you have to

453
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,380
download and how much is cached like for

454
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,520
example the iphone browser is caching

455
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,350
25k uncompressed so if used geez if it

456
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,360
it doesn't help it's really like the

457
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,060
pure JavaScript code uncompressed that

458
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,270
can be catched so you have to care it's

459
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,130
like a vampire now that was only true

460
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,670
way back and I really yeah okay that's

461
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,180
good news so what but they're also a

462
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,830
different device like the nokia device

463
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,660
they handle it all so different and i

464
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,630
think we still have to support all the

465
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,250
devices and also older operate our older

466
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,790
browser environments so because people

467
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,010
don't just upgrade their system all the

468
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,030
time so and also what is really hard

469
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:28,240
testing on all those devices and i think

470
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,850
not everyone has all these devices at

471
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,400
home they cost a lot of money and it's

472
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,750
there need a solution for that that you

473
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,850
can access all these devices there's for

474
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,770
example what an interesting service

475
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,930
called perfecto mobile they really have

476
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,810
x there you have access to all the lot

477
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,330
of mobile phones and you pay a monthly

478
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,730
fee and what they then do you have a

479
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,770
camera and look on to a device and they

480
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,970
put it into like a holder and place

481
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,680
there and then you can place your

482
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,840
application there and test it it's

483
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,850
really maybe it's a good tool to do that

484
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,010
and a lot cheaper than buying all these

485
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,790
devices but yeah there's there's a lot

486
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,860
of relief I think using all the existing

487
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,690
JavaScript frameworks also is a big

488
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:25,090
relief but it's they help you a lot but

489
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,670
you're not completely there i would say

490
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,770
ninety percent there's ten percent

491
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,570
missing and as i know john you're

492
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,029
writing currently also writing at

493
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,889
it's getting more mobile support into

494
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:37,899
jquery i'm doing that you're doing a

495
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:40,119
business mobile devices yeah I'm getting

496
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,960
it this reverses yeah and i hope i hope

497
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,789
so that more frameworks will do that and

498
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:48,219
that all the frameworks can be used on

499
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:51,429
in the mobile space without explicitly

500
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:53,849
testing every little tiny bit and

501
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,919
checking if something is not working but

502
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,719
i think there's still a lot of work to

503
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,999
do to support all those devices that

504
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:04,509
devices so and also there's mu touch

505
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:08,409
jqtouch I you I for solving at least the

506
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,749
problem to write applications now for

507
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:12,669
the iphone or that they look like an

508
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:16,409
iPhone but there will be I think more

509
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:19,330
look and feel different look and fields

510
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,879
for different platforms then there's xui

511
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:26,379
the JavaScript framework or phonegap

512
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:28,960
it's also interesting because they

513
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,570
really care about fire sighs and about

514
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:34,509
features within their JavaScript

515
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:36,309
framework so it's a good start if you

516
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:38,529
have want to ride in simple application

517
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:44,139
you can use xui so and what also really

518
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:47,679
helps a lot is using CSS transitions or

519
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,889
media queries to support we have to get

520
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:52,239
the speed the performance on the device

521
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:54,849
and also supporting the different screen

522
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:58,330
sizes so of course yeah then jazz

523
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,570
packers just to keep the file size small

524
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,869
and all the existing debuggers that are

525
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:08,109
out there like firebug and you can just

526
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:10,239
test it in the browser and have the same

527
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:12,039
tools as you would normally write web

528
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:16,690
applications so this just a small thing

529
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,019
a position fixed is a problem on iphone

530
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:23,619
and android you can just do it and so

531
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,539
next week there will be a real release

532
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,210
by david l radio he's written a touch

533
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,259
scroll epic javascript library or a

534
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:37,119
helper that helps with scrolling like

535
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,330
pains and it was really worked on at for

536
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,460
three months and tested it all on the

537
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:42,960
different

538
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,559
Isis and we'll be out next week and we

539
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,130
were also currently working on a dojo

540
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,250
mobile and you will also hear something

541
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,140
about in the next weeks so what are the

542
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,130
conclusion of all that is all these

543
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,710
different packaging systems that are out

544
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,950
there absolutely phonegap and so on I

545
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,770
would be happy if we're not talking

546
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,590
about specific platforms like Palm webOS

547
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,289
or just phonegap I would be really happy

548
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:19,830
if we coined that term html5 apps and

549
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,240
that everyone can use that term it's not

550
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,330
technically completely correct but I

551
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,179
think it's easier to sell that to

552
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,669
someone who is not into our business and

553
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:38,580
so this is my conclusion of html5 apps
