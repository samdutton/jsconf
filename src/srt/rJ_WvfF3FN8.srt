1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,110
Okay if you think they are doing badly you stand up you can believe they are making 

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,120
I stand here talking about the entire presentation!

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,970
Hello everyone, my tame is Tara.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,449
Today I will ask you to use your imagination to think about the web in a way you never thought

5
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,480
Before.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,189
What I ask you to imagine is a web without a server.

7
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,970
If your immediate response is chaos or skepticism, it's okay because it doesn't

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,270
It has a lot to do with how the Internet works today.

9
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,950
If I tell my background and my work now, they will start to come together.

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,960
My name is Tara Vancil and I am a web developer.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,710
For me, this means that I spend most of my time thinking about networking or building things

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,030
Online.

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,170
I'm really interested in peer-to-peer protocols. I like anything about nails.

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:11,299
If you are interested in polish or nail polish, we will definitely talk about it later.

15
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,969
The Internet is now a very important part of my life, but this is not always the case.

16
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:17,249
I didn't actually grow up online.

17
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:21,929
My family does not have a computer and we live in a rural area with a little internet.

18
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:26,329
The only computer I have access to is the school. We mainly use them to learn how

19
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:28,590
Enter.

20
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,609
I did enter Facebook, MySpace and Sparknotes in my teens, but my object line experience

21
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,590
It's mainly about consumption.

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,759
I'm almost watching my photos crush and catch up with books I don't have

23
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,350
Reading English lessons.

24
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,840
It was not until a long time ago that I learned about the existence of HTML, JavaScript and

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,899
CSS I realized I can build stuff online.

26
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,820
It's just something I never considered before.

27
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,770
I think building a website is reserved for super talented programmers.

28
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,060
This is a very, very exciting time for me.

29
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,590
Because it completely changed my perception of what the web is and how I participate

30
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,400
On it.

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,989
But after studying, I finally realized how to write a web page in HTML.

32
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,629
I need an important question to answer: how do I share these things

33
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm building?

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,739
Thankfully, the answer to this question is really simple.

35
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:33,040
You just need to install webpack using MPM and you can set up your local web server and SSH to the server

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,159
You have set it up on AWS.

37
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,930
OK, it's actually not that simple.

38
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,189
Now, to be clear, I'm joking.

39
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:47,349
I do n’t think tools are complicated and bad, I think tools are great because they help

40
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:51,900
We build things, it doesn't matter which tool you choose, as long as it helps you

41
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,000
Build what the browser can understand.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,260
Whether you are writing a simple HTML file or building something more complex, your options are valid.

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,799
The point is that writing web pages is flexible and forgive

44
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,340
Initial beginners have space and most experts-experts in building something

45
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,590
What makes sense is what makes the web such a great toolset.

46
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,689
When I was a beginner, it was actually a kind burden to build something and share

47
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:22,689
The internet.

48
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:26,829
I can tell you that this is not a tool to make. I feel that way.

49
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,110
This is the server.

50
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,890
Now, I mean the best way, but the server is terrible.

51
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,049
I feel like this because I started building things online in this sweet place

52
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:46,170
The period when GeoCities was closed but tools like Netlify and Glitch did not

53
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,830
Still exists.

54
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,079
GitHub pages are everywhere, but I don't feel comfortable using git at that point.

55
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,549
As far as I know, the best option I share is the website I am making

56
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,370
Set up the server.

57
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:04,620
This is frustrating because I don't have the time, expertise or money to do this.

58
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,969
Really, who?

59
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:11,720
Like a human super sliver, who knows how to set up a server,

60
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,129
And, let alone enjoy it.

61
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:19,430
I can set up the server now, for a few days, when I have the mood to play Engine X

62
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:25,160
But most of the time this is the last thing I want to do.

63
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,150
I believe some people in this room are running the server very well, but I don't think it is

64
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,230
Fairly expect the rest of the world.

65
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,560
With 3 billion people on the Internet today, that number will only grow.

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,530
They are using tools like Facebook, Instagram and WeChat welcome.

67
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,930
awesome.

68
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,780
We saw on a scale that the connection between people was once unimaginable.

69
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,860
But I think it's fair to say that most of these people will never go

70
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,819
Engage these tools beyond the boundaries of the network.

71
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:02,080
Post tweets, share life updates on Facebook, or show photos of Berlin Street

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,330
Cats on Instagram, but they will never make an HTML page, and never for their fan site

73
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,430
Favorite band.

74
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,120
They can never experience the joy of creative building something online

75
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,560
It really is theirs.

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,650
I think we have to sit down and think about whether this is really appropriate.

77
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,050
maybe.

78
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,660
Maybe not everyone wants to learn how to build a website.

79
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,910
But I think we should be sure that the network itself will not hinder those

80
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,599
Who does it.

81
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:38,830
Personally, I worry about it.

82
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,970
I'm afraid that publishing online is a bottleneck.

83
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,389
It's as simple as sending HTML files to friends. It's too complicated.

84
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,740
I mean, think about it: if you know the web, you can spend months and months packing

85
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,539
Latest on how to write HTML pages, vertical center divs or navigation

86
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:58,449
JavaScript framework.

87
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,990
After all, you have your own support, you have some confidence, maybe it was built

88
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,460
You are proud of something.

89
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,849
You still need to figure out the server.

90
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:09,300
I just think the web can do better.

91
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,270
In fact, I think it's vital that the web do better.

92
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,220
Because barriers to entry remain-if barriers to entry remain high, I

93
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,330
Hate thinking about the web for ten or two decades.

94
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,430
Keep in mind that the web has been around since 1990, and we have seen early

95
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:32,819
What happens when most people use a few platforms is involved.

96
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,330
So how does this work for a long time?

97
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:41,259
If 28 years from today, what it will look like, most people are still using tools like Facebook,

98
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,970
Or WeChat, or Instagram.

99
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:51,690
Is it still the web or does the provider shape it into something completely different?

100
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,930
I do n’t know, but it seems to make sense, but I do n’t think this is a risk we should be willing to take

101
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,690
take.

102
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,990
The network is too precious.

103
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,690
This is a weird social experiment that establishes a global language for building things.

104
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,780
How cool?

105
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:15,669
At least, I think a network like this looks boring to me.

106
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,470
If you were here last year, you may remember one of our hosts, Rachel White, made a statement

107
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,569
Called Keep the Web Weird.

108
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:29,550
When I interpreted it as that kind of love letter community, the internet inspired creativity

109
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,979
Well, the tools are accessible.

110
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,729
She returned to GeoCities and Angel Fire with several tools at the time

111
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:45,610
People can jump into the browser, write HTML, and publish the website for free.

112
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:52,690
But you probably know that GeoCities was closed down in 2009 and took 38 million websites

113
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,690
it.

114
00:07:53,690 --> 00:08:01,509
Archives provide a courageous effort to save those websites and save precious gifts

115
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:05,669
From the age of GeoCities, but failed to save all 38 million websites.

116
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,710
They are gone.

117
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:16,310
I think GeoCities come and go and the rise of Neocities and Glitch tells us

118
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,069
What we have about the internet and what is missing from it.

119
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:26,199
I think it tells us that setting up the server is out of reach for most people

120
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,680
They simply can't do it. Instead, they have the tools to rely on it.

121
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,320
Now, I like Neocities, I like Glitch, and in fact, I think they do the most

122
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,360
Now important network work.

123
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,610
We came here before 3 Neocities and Glitch to help us circumvent the fact of publishing

124
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:50,480
Difficult online, but I think we should ask why it is so uncomfortable

125
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,529
First place?

126
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:57,380
What can we do to make it easier for the kind of longevity we expect

127
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,010
network platform?

128
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,720
I think we can make it easier, and I want to share with you my views on this possible

129
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,100
looks like.

130
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,570
I would like to ask if the server shares a website if we don't need it?

131
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:17,220
What if we can press the button in the browser and, with one click, create a new web page?

132
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,640
That would be great but how can we pull it down the world?

133
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,260
We have these very powerful devices.

134
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,779
We have mobile phones, laptops, right?

135
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,420
Maybe we can turn them into servers?

136
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,180
Sadly, this is not easy.

137
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,890
There are many problems with this idea, but in short, our personal devices

138
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,550
It's just not the server.

139
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,680
First, we sometimes close them, is it because we are asleep

140
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,450
Or the battery is broken.

141
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,230
They do not always have dedicated IP addresses, and they are not built at all for processing

142
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,200
The kind of traffic the server does.

143
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,519
Imagine publishing a video computer from your personal to make it viral.

144
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,440
Your computer will be overwhelmed by millions of requests, and your home network may

145
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,900
He fell down after a few minutes.

146
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,490
Well, if this one-click publishing idea is to work, we have to think outside

147
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,920
Server box, because, again, our personal device is just not a server.

148
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,180
Fortunately, some smart people have solved this problem on its head and have found a regular way

149
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:28,320
A device doesn't need to be a server to do various things of the server.

150
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,100
BitTorrent was created in the early 2000s and you call it a peer-to-peer network.

151
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:42,300
The key innovation is asking if instead one computer, one server, handles all

152
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,700
What is the responsibility of hosting files if we share this responsibility

153
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,880
A network of a bunch of different computers so that any device can jump to the network

154
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,440
And contribute some bandwidth?

155
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,390
Maybe some of these devices are similar to those that the server undoubtedly exists in the cloud

156
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:07,630
Sometimes some devices go offline, but the big idea is that regular devices can help

157
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,529
Contribute a network of resources to hosted files?

158
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,390
This is really a big problem.

159
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,040
Now, I believe most people know BitTorrent because of its shame.

160
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,519
It is mainly used for downloading movies and illegal music and other media, but I

161
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,880
I want to point out that it is incredible with a lot of legal and other innovations

162
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,740
Legal use case.

163
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,300
The most important thing is that it makes it possible for ordinary people with regular equipment

164
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,970
Being able to host files, I just thought it was pretty cool.

165
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,470
So what if we take this approach and we apply it online?

166
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,610
Websites are just files after all.

167
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,940
If the website is just a collection of files, then if we can use peer-to-peer

168
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,800
To get a website from one computer to another?

169
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,620
It turns out you can, I'm really excited to tell you more about it.

170
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,500
I work with these two guys-P Frazee and Macintosh.

171
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,830
They are all here today.

172
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:17,089
The three of us worked together on a project called Beaker Browser.

173
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:21,779
Beaker is an experimental browser, meaning we don't always follow web standards.

174
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:26,500
But this is not because we don't think they are important, we have only performed some experiments

175
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,420
Remember we want to run, we think they are worth running, even if they are

176
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,579
Does not meet the standard.

177
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:38,510
What the core experiment we are running happens when you take one of these peer-to-peer

178
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,149
Web, do you put it in your browser?

179
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:48,390
So we want to keep the web roughly the same, keep the browser very familiar, but make

180
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,560
It's peer.

181
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,660
We are in a very lucky position to do this experiment.

182
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,790
Because Macintosh is a peer-to-peer protocol for core developers called Dat

183
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,709
Similar to BitTorrent, but there are important improvements that make it perfect for this type

184
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,019
What we do online.

185
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:12,150
We took it to the browser, then put it in. It went into Beaker and found something really

186
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:18,399
Interesting things happen, such as enabling one-click publishing, giving the view source cool

187
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,140
New features and made it possible to provide developers with new Web APIs.

188
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,260
Why don't I show you?

189
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,290
Ok.

190
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,290
This is the beaker.

191
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,670
My apologies for the tags and URL bar are small.

192
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,740
I will try to point out what is important.

193
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,610
At first glance, it looks spectacular to any browser you are familiar with.

194
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,230
So it is not significant in this regard.

195
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,110
Before I show you anything exciting, I tell you what a peer-to-peer website looks like.

196
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,230
like.

197
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,430
This is my website, you may notice that instead of HTTPS, the protocol in the URL

198
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,430
It's DAT.

199
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,320
It's really small but that's what it says.

200
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,420
It looks like the website you expect looks like-the links work like you

201
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:10,070
I hope that the images work the same way they do in other browsers

202
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,070
CSS.

203
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,009
This is our intention choice.

204
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:23,259
We do n’t want to end the web, we want to see what happens if we put

205
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:41,690
One of the peer-to-peer networks.

206
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:55,480
[Distorted sound input].

207
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,740
We do treat this device like a server but it is not.

208
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,880
So I want to jump to Beaker's main menu and click the "Create New" button.

209
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,170
I will click on the website template.

210
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,340
You can create an empty project or import an existing one.

211
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,680
For this, I will import this template time.

212
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,860
What happened here was Beaker forging a brand new website.

213
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,210
It has information on how to get started, change the background color here, nothing

214
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,260
It's too fancy.

215
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,279
I think it's exciting that this site has its own URL.

216
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,259
I can share this URL with anyone of you.

217
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:39,240
If you want to open it in Beaker, because we are the only one who supports it, you can

218
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,470
Download the website from my computer.

219
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,940
No server is involved here.

220
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,139
Right now, this URL is not very pretty.

221
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:48,389
do not you remember.

222
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:52,399
Just like IP addresses are hard to remember.

223
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,200
How does a URL like this use the Domain Name System? It turned out to work great.

224
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,010
I built a website to show you how it works.

225
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,889
This is the JSConf EU subdomain on my website.

226
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:11,829
By using, I was able to get a txt record of this wonderful time.

227
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:18,069
I set it up through my domain registrar-Google-I pointed the subdomain to long

228
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:20,970
Ugly URL, that's all it needs.

229
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,370
I don't have any server fuss to get that good URL.

230
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:32,540
I promised you, I will tell you to observe the source, let's take a look at Beak Beck.

231
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,440
What we see here is all the files that make up the site we just looked at

232
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,810
in.

233
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:44,470
You can see favicon here we can take a look at the style and of course we can

234
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,830
See the HTML we just saw.

235
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,580
These files exist on my computer.

236
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,720
Shouldn't I be able to edit them if they live on my computer?

237
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,660
Yes, you can.

238
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,610
We can actually edit the file in the view source so I can click the button

239
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,990
Right here.

240
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,310
I want to add some exclamation marks to this title.

241
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:12,220
When I save and return the label, we see those changes.

242
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,880
[applause].

243
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,360
OK, this is cool, but we are all developers and we may have a preference for us

244
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,320
Editing environment?

245
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,230
Some of us like Sublime, and some of us like DS Code.

246
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:32,310
Again, these files are all on my computer, so I can open them in my favorite editor.

247
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,410
Before I do this, I want to open a cool one we have a small feature-library loading

248
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:49,190
-I want to jump over-I want to jump to the view source tool

249
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,190
once again.

250
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:56,200
I want to copy the path to those local files on my computer.

251
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,340
And open those files.

252
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:11,410
I want to open the index.html file, I just want to say "Hello, from Sublime".

253
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:16,370
Once I click on save and go to the tab, we can see the changes without the need

254
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,370
Refresh.

255
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,370
[applause].

256
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,941
This is an interesting gadget.

257
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:30,140
So i show you one click release

258
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,071
You see some new stuff sources we enabled but i didn't tell you about the new

259
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,060
Network API is not yet available.

260
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,340
Before I do this, I want to give a backstory why we think this is necessary.

261
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,830
When we first started building Beaker, we were happy with the facts we could do

262
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:50,900
Launched one-click publishing but we realized that the web is not a static collection

263
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,150
Website, though it might be a better place if it is.

264
00:18:54,150 --> 00:19:01,540
We think there is any way to reconstruct the behavior used by applications on the web

265
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,690
Pee network?

266
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,780
Can we solve problems with user profiles, databases, or something like that?

267
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,230
The answer is yes.

268
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,490
If you consider it, the database or user profile is usually represented by just

269
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,490
Documents, right?

270
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:23,020
And, if the site is just files, then maybe we can represent user data and users

271
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,590
Personal information on the website.

272
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,980
This is what we and others mean. Building on these toolsets is experimentation.

273
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,540
use.

274
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,870
This is a profile.json file.

275
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,970
This is the profile social media site I use on peer-to-peer.

276
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,341
You can see these attributes are my name, bio, and avatar.

277
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:51,620
I think it would be easier for me to sink it later if I said that.

278
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,600
If we want to make it possible for developers to build peer-to-peer applications to use user data,

279
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,280
We need to make sure they can read and write rye data.

280
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,270
The new Web API looks a bit like this.

281
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,220
Again, it would be easier if I just told you.

282
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,150
I plan to jump to the console site here.

283
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,030
Let's see.

284
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,850
I want to launch this Dat website on behalf of us by getting an object

285
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,850
on.

286
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:31,710
I will use it to do this using Dat to archive the API and Beaker we have.

287
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,930
Do window.location.

288
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,330
We have this object now and we can do many things with it.

289
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,830
I want to tell you something we can write about this site's new HTML file.

290
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,830
We will have a website written by ourselves.

291
00:20:46,830 --> 00:21:01,560
Ok, so website.writefile and call it api.html and write simple markup for it.

292
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:09,160
We wrote this file, now if we go to api.ptml we can see that we have created

293
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,300
A new HTML file.

294
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,960
[applause].

295
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,570
This may not be completely intuitive at first, but it can be done a lot.

296
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:27,330
We have a complete social media application with these APIs for writing user profiles.

297
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,770
It looks a bit like Twitter, and you may have noticed that it was intentional.

298
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:35,770
We want to see if we can replicate a lot of the behavior Twitter provides, so

299
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:41,720
We have a feed, we can look at people's posts, and of course we can post replies.

300
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:51,470
I think I would say "Hello from JSConf", anyone who follows me will sync

301
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,419
These changes come from my profile

302
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:56,300
-Synchronize these changes. "

303
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:08,330
I want-I want to show you what I mean by putting

304
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:15,060
User data from user profile to website.

305
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:19,560
These are my posts.

306
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,230
The objects that represent my posts are beautiful and simple: text and timestamps.

307
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:32,330
If this is a response, it will also contain information about the person I responded to.

308
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,140
I think it's cool.

309
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,910
Interesting things happen when separated from user data at the application layer.

310
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,700
In this case, the application layer is a point of view above my profile.

311
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,950
# 1 in the profiles of all my friends.

312
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:52,630
This means that neither the application nor the data is bundled longer, so I can actually customize

313
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,670
The application has no consequences, so let's do it and let's see what happens

314
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,670
jobs.

315
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,790
I will open it in ViewSource.

316
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,760
I'm not just this site, so I can't just edit them.

317
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,850
I have to make a copy.

318
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,860
I want to continue making copies.

319
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,500
I don't like that kind of churros.

320
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,800
This app has round buttons.

321
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,890
I want to make it square.

322
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:21,059
I'm going to jump to the CSS file here and search for the button class.

323
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,450
This is the border radius I want to get rid of.

324
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,480
We will save it.

325
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,910
We will see a brand new social media application.

326
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,440
We can see that the buttons are now square.

327
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,170
[applause].

328
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:45,150
I didn't give this specific example application permissions write to my profile

329
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,980
That's why it looks a little different, but if I choose my profile and load everything

330
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,020
Get up, I won't lose any friends.

331
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,200
I will not lose my network or content or anything.

332
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,390
Even though this change I made is a bit trivial, you can imagine being in a situation

333
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:04,480
On social media, it's not trivial to want to change production.

334
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Maybe you want to have some say how the color scheme works because you are

335
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,580
Color blindness, or you want better control tools.

336
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,390
You have the right to do this with this model, and I think it's great.

337
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:25,090
Right now, I will not make any promises of this type of model, a peer-to-peer network

338
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,910
To solve all wrong network problems, I will not promise

339
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,960
Apps like Friter will always be as popular as Facebook or Twitter because

340
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,120
They are already very popular, but I can guarantee a peer-to-peer network

341
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,610
To make such an application possible, I can say it's full of confidence because I use Friter

342
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,000
Every day, my friends do the same.

343
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,930
If you want to know more about Beaker, please talk to me later, I am happy to share

344
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,930
about it.

345
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,740

346
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:03,530
I want to end this and fundamentally, the peer-to-peer network is a more interesting network,

347
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:12,330
No matter what your technical expertise is, this is one you can contribute, build and

348
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,330
share it.

349
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,960
I think this makes it a valuable experiment to run not only in Beaker, but also on each one individually

350
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Browser.

351
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,951
Thank you so much for imagining me.

352
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:20,951
[applause].
