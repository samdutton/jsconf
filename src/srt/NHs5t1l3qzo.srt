1
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,030

so I'm my full name is coven they busy

2
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,800
you call me coven easiest way to

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
remember k with an oven and for the last

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,960
few years I've been making interactive

5
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,730
and public art and more recently I've

6
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,769
been thinking about how to bring the

7
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:54,079
internet into that so how to make works

8
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,480
for a wider public and it's really

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,100
exciting for me to be here right now

10
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,929
because the JavaScript community has

11
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,640
been a big influence in the values i

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,499
have in making this work especially in

13
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:06,740
like the emphasis of building openly and

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,670
collaboratively and so i tweeted out

15
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,390
some links for some of the demos and

16
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,009
later on we'll try them out maybe

17
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,659
they'll work maybe they want but either

18
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:20,090
way we'll have some fun so a little bit

19
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,670
about myself I work at a company called

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,649
in bed Lee I'm coming down for Boston

21
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:27,649
and what we do is it's an API for

22
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:31,969
embedding media so people use it in

23
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,829
their apps or websites to create medium

24
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:36,290
a ship's or expressive media stuff open

25
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,030
sources tool recently player JS for

26
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,729
working with movie players or sound

27
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:43,850
players a few years ago I began a public

28
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,009
art group called new American public art

29
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,960
with a few collaborators and whatever we

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,299
make it must follow to principles one

31
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:52,490
its interactive so whatever we make must

32
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,770
respond to you and to its public if you

33
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,420
go to the peace you must be able to see

34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,210
it or engage with it for free you know

35
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,350
you shouldn't have to pay anything for

36
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,180
it and we we did this because we realize

37
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,009
that there's a huge opportunity in

38
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,079
cities and public spaces for this kind

39
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,369
of work to create a platform for

40
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:09,259
conversation or just to have fun and

41
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,450
meet new people and just more citizen

42
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,640
engagement I want to tell you about this

43
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,380
group the austin foundation recently

44
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,650
I've been participating in and it's

45
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,510
because yesterday a lot of you made some

46
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,030
pretty awesome projects what they do is

47
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,710
there's several chapters all around the

48
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,870
states and once a month many of them

49
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,430
give thousand-dollar grants so if you

50
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,740
need some funding for materials send

51
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,180
your project idea to them and then maybe

52
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,070
you'll get funded it's not only like

53
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,690
open tech projects but just you know

54
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,000
various art projects or socially or

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,770
socially conscious projects or maybe

56
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,250
business prototypes so on making

57
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,040
interactive and collaborative art

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,730
traditionally like when we think of

59
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,260
traditional art we think about going to

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,360
a gallery and seeing a painting and we

61
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,370
take a picture of it but we we draw

62
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,660
meaning from it we could talk about it

63
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,910
with interactive art it's more of a

64
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,890
two-way street so here's a piece by

65
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,900
Daniel Rosen which i think is really

66
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,760
interesting there's a camera on it and a

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,610
whole lattice of motors and they move

68
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,130
they move these little objects that are

69
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,870
attached there to create what looks like

70
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,450
a silhouette and we can zoom in a bit

71
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,460
further so here's so I'm just moving

72
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,620
around it gives you like a little you

73
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,000
get a dialogue with the piece you can

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,440
explore it a little bit and when you

75
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,300
look closer it's all these bits of trash

76
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,730
moving around this is really strange but

77
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,230
it's something that's that's a bit

78
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,520
curious you can explore it a little bit

79
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,500
and I think that's interesting so we

80
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,420
move to another piece set that I find

81
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,240
really interesting is by design i oh not

82
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,490
only is this interactive but you could

83
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,590
do it with groups of people here people

84
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,330
are moving around and stuff and you

85
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,890
realize they're controlling these

86
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,850
animations and i love that that here you

87
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,220
have the space of play and you're you're

88
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,590
you you can go with somebody you know or

89
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,150
somebody you've never met before and all

90
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,470
of a sudden like everything's a bit more

91
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,510
whimsical and silly and fun

92
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:03,410
oh do it later um such as I know uh you

93
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,330
guys remember that beach ball what what

94
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,010
was going on like couple nights ago like

95
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,100
we could have gone for hours oh that's

96
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,290
not an art piece but like I drew so I

97
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,910
just loved it so much I was

98
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,010
entertainment what was going on the

99
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,870
boundaries of that were really permeable

100
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,100
you could join it you could leave it

101
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,900
like whenever you wanted but there was a

102
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,280
lot of smiling and laughing and I

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,650
thought that was really beautiful

104
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,910
whenever I make a piece that's what I

105
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,270
want to get to somehow so I'm going to

106
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,620
talk about a couple installations that

107
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,820
I've done and then I'll move more into

108
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,500
the internet based stuff the first one

109
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,480
plays with the metaphor of a dinner

110
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,130
table that you can get a gather around

111
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,080
and you know have a conversation and

112
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,150
Lego something that you can use to build

113
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,390
construct together or alone in this case

114
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,150
our dinner table was this giant beach

115
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,070
ball we covered in fiberglass and

116
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,530
magnets and our Legos were little metal

117
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,170
pieces and we took it to a festival and

118
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,550
we told people we've discovered this

119
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,380
strange planet with these strong

120
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,880
magnetic properties and we need their

121
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,250
help to build civilizations and some

122
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,450
people jump right into it some people

123
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,310
didn't but then you know soon they

124
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,650
wanted to well it was cool to see how

125
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,810
this this could become like like a

126
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,520
sandbox this could become a world to

127
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,800
explore someone brought a Godzilla and

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,540
put magnets on its feet that could live

129
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,890
on the planet and destroy some of the

130
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,470
buildings you would see things other

131
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,000
people made maybe you want to copy it

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,550
maybe you'd want to add to it you could

133
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,620
destroy things you could construct with

134
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,990
a friend or meet new people as you're as

135
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,880
you're working on these pieces and one

136
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,380
of my favorite things was that like

137
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,300
families getting involved too so here

138
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,400
you have three generations the daughter

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,650
the father and the grandfather all like

140
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,270
playing with this piece and they're

141
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,620
smiling they're having fun this is cool

142
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,360
here's another piece this is a really

143
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,500
simple prototype just a self-cleansing

144
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,940
it's some a microphone connected to an

145
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,970
LED strip and the louder the sounds that

146
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:02,060
it picks up the yeah there you go the

147
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,910
more it glows and so there's many like

148
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,229
this is very flexible you could put it

149
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:08,240
in a club you could put in a gallery you

150
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,930
can attach to a

151
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,330
sculpture I'm coming from Boston it gets

152
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,009
really cold in the winter so we put it

153
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,419
outside maybe you'd make the winner

154
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:17,030
better and it picks up the ambient sound

155
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:25,410
and so if you yell

156
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,670
it starts to glow and it's not really

157
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,110
okay to yell in public but this things

158
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:40,430
like you can yell it's totally fine

159
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:49,929
it's little

160
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,559
so what is it that that I'm that I'm

161
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,240
seeing that happens okay like people

162
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,309
this brings people together this makes

163
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:57,869
wherever we install it it makes the

164
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,849
space feel more welcoming and then like

165
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,709
four groups of people participating they

166
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,059
can get more creative and they can get

167
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,339
more playful and I feel like you get you

168
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:06,749
can build meaning together with this

169
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:08,490
sort of work so now we're looking at

170
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,050
this medium of the web where there's so

171
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,669
many tools for interact interactivity

172
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:14,520
and also collaboration can I can I make

173
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
those those similar experiences can I

174
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,969
can I bring them into the web similarly

175
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,379
like the only way you could yell at that

176
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:21,569
led thing is if you were there like but

177
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:22,949
what if I connected to the internet so

178
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,539
now you could yell at your computer and

179
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,059
then maybe it would light up so the

180
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:28,649
browser is a canvas all of these

181
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,509
libraries that are being written they're

182
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:32,249
being open source I can I can download

183
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,259
and I can use all the API is available i

184
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,419
can use this is a pretty powerful canvas

185
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,659
and its network too i'm making this in

186
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,939
javascript this you know there was a

187
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,259
reason for this the community is so

188
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,089
strong if i had a question i could find

189
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,309
the answer or somebody i know would know

190
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:50,069
where the answer is the ubiquity of it i

191
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,839
create something for my computer and it

192
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,279
will work on your computer and i work on

193
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,589
other ones if I tweaked it a bit and

194
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:56,849
just a general interest you make

195
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,649
something crazy and like people want to

196
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,149
know what's going on they're interested

197
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,229
in what's possible with these

198
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,619
technologies so the my first like kind

199
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,300
of foray into this of like public art

200
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,279
putting the Internet to it is inspired

201
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,709
by a piece by kusama there's his room

202
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,180
with furniture net painted completely

203
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,369
white and when you walked in you were

204
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,599
given stickers and you could put a

205
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,039
sticker wherever you want it and I'd

206
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,539
love to trust the artist gave in this

207
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,179
like yeah you can you can leave your

208
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:22,800
mark here it's okay so what would that

209
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,749
be like on the web okay like I could

210
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,240
draw circles on this web page and i can

211
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,919
add web sockets so like i could see the

212
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,949
circles you draw sweet cool all right so

213
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,750
this is like this is familiar to us we

214
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,240
all we all get this but like for some

215
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,469
people feels like magic you know and

216
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:39,029
that's kind of fun and then you get

217
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:40,800
these interesting patterns like faces

218
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,539
and circle pines but really once it's on

219
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,889
a screen then you could do a lot of

220
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,120
different things with it you could

221
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,550
project it on a building and like the

222
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,079
scale is suddenly so different it's not

223
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,120
about my hand in my in my head anymore

224
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,800
it's like my hands in my head it's like

225
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,240
my whole body like you walk in front of

226
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,040
saying feel it and somebody walks by and

227
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,209
rarely do you see something on this

228
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,710
scale in a city that you can

229
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,630
change but now you can you just go to

230
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,740
this website on your phone you could

231
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,570
change it I wasn't even here this was in

232
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,550
Grand Rapids I was in somerville I went

233
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,960
on the website and I changed it to it

234
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,920
was wonderful and it took like

235
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,080
screenshots it was felt really good

236
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,940
here's another building we protected on

237
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,070
in some of the patterns you know someone

238
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,860
wrote a que because I made it on here's

239
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,390
a happy face someone started drawing

240
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,440
hair on it help I don't know why someone

241
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,780
was desiring help through this there's

242
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,200
other channels like different patterns

243
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,110
like that a happy phase so we can try

244
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:38,640
you want to so like if you've whoa okay

245
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,770
cool so what's happening this is all of

246
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,300
us doing this together and it's working

247
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,890
great you're in my talk with me maybe

248
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,570
I'll return oh my god this is so many

249
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,890
gay ok so I'm going to leave that open

250
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,860
ok so now screens now objects this is a

251
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,620
sweet led peace by Leo via real and you

252
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,700
go through it and there's all this

253
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,980
beautiful shimmering I want to be able

254
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,620
to change that in some way so gotten LED

255
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,530
grid hooked it up to the browser nodes

256
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,200
cereal and all right now I'm drawing on

257
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,340
it okay once it's working in the browser

258
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,290
cool okay I build a housing so now I

259
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,820
could take it on the airplane doesn't

260
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,340
look as sketchy and then I could draw on

261
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,990
it with a phone like now it's with the

262
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,970
phone okay now one font control with it

263
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,890
then I can get multiple phones sweet now

264
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,990
we have a collaborative like piece of

265
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,210
art that we can all access with our

266
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,350
phones and you can imagine this in a

267
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,840
storefront and like that storefront that

268
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,070
area suddenly become so much more

269
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,780
activated and this is just a small

270
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,340
prototype there's like many other

271
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,290
possibilities I'm going to return to

272
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,910
this kind of stuff later on in the talk

273
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,230
now I'm going to go to other weird

274
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,380
internet art stuff tumblr as a medium

275
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,870
for art gifts are popular and tumblr I

276
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,310
was making some gifts and posting them

277
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,440
many of them didn't work out but some of

278
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,120
them did and that like triggers these

279
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,820
neural synapses and just wanting more

280
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,090
but I didn't have time to make so many

281
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,320
more like it takes a while to make one

282
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,940
that's compelling so I just set up a

283
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,350
script to make them these like really

284
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,000
minimal gradients because I found them

285
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,520
very soothing and i'd post them every

286
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,320
three hours I was joining them with the

287
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,420
canvas and then using phantom

288
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,800
to auto post them or up to to

289
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,060
auto-generate them and then i'd post

290
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,760
that then I wake up one morning and it's

291
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,190
like whoa just got a lot of followers

292
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,950
this is doing way better than I am what

293
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,899
does this mean about me on tumblr and

294
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,850
you see these numbers they make you feel

295
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,050
great but then you look at it a little

296
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,760
bit further and then I saw comments on

297
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,470
one of the reblogs if you're like me and

298
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,690
often feel over stimulated by visual

299
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,149
stimuli I recommend this blog like blog

300
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,959
I foot with all those graphics basically

301
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,670
it's just really nice and I read this

302
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,649
and I was like wow that's really kind of

303
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,720
you to say and I'm also really glad that

304
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,240
I made your day a little bit better

305
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,149
we're both really happy right now and I

306
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:52,500
don't know you and you don't know me but

307
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,139
you know things are going to be okay so

308
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,050
this uses p5 it's a rewriting processing

309
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,730
in JavaScript highly recommend to check

310
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,899
it out if you want to get into creative

311
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,750
coding it's amazing canvas and phantom

312
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,029
of course all right so now we have this

313
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:08,730
webcam we take selfies with it all right

314
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,110
what can I do with that i was looking at

315
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,639
pixel sorting yesterday we learn a

316
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,899
little bit about sorting so I wasn't a

317
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,779
pixel sorting and a like glitch art so I

318
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,220
was like what if I pixel sort of my face

319
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,720
there's my face boom pixel sorting okay

320
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,149
so it's like abstracted I don't know I

321
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,680
started thinking really deeply about it

322
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,850
I was like all right this is the end of

323
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,649
2013 when I made this it was the year of

324
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,410
the selfie but to 2013 over welcome to

325
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,579
another you'd like take your photo and

326
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,820
obliterate it mmm cool art and here's

327
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,310
here's like what the app look like you

328
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,899
get this gif of your face and so people

329
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,970
like started taking like I put it out

330
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,890
online people shared it and then so just

331
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,449
like random people started sending me

332
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:48,660
their faces getting obliterated and it

333
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,730
was like younger folks elder folks but

334
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,110
then also like I like this one because

335
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,579
it was like with the cat so it's like

336
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:58,230
cat selfie obliteration and then here

337
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,089
was another artist who like to do visual

338
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:03,569
effects in the browser forest and so he

339
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:05,010
saw what I had made and then he made

340
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,360
this and send it to me and then we met

341
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,339
each other and it was cool like or we

342
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,660
met each other online and that's always

343
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,250
fun to like make and then dialogue

344
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,180
through that so that used canvas

345
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,980
getusermedia for the image web workers

346
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,420
to make the pixel sorting faster in like

347
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,640
the best pixels world library

348
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,180
so forth and I like later on work

349
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,400
together on this other piece this

350
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,040
JavaScript facial tracking library came

351
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,610
out what so we were like let's use that

352
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,529
and we just added this is crazy visuals

353
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:37,839
on it like circles and things like that

354
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,460
it made no sense but it was really

355
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,589
stimulating and we added like little

356
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:44,080
screen shots in the background and we

357
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,960
just put it up for for art hack day and

358
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,190
it was fun like what's more fun than the

359
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,180
piece it's really something what's more

360
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,589
fun to seeing how people responded to it

361
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,080
it was like when they would they would

362
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,520
try to get the algorithm to recognize

363
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,660
him and then once they were recognized

364
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,130
it's like boom they were the chosen one

365
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,230
and then they'd start making faces at it

366
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,640
and then like they would just forget

367
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,779
about everyone else and then their

368
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:02,920
friends would like kind of nudge them

369
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,690
and try to be the chosen one and this is

370
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,160
like the best metric of success like

371
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,300
someone took a selfie with it was a

372
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,050
goose so that's like get user media clm

373
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,930
trackers the facial recognition tool

374
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,200
canvas all right beyond the web camera

375
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,130
using the Kinect is it possible to

376
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,310
stream buffers visual buffers to the

377
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,589
browser I tried it with socket i/o

378
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:28,150
things got really slow I didn't know

379
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,280
what I was doing I was recommended to

380
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,810
use WebSocket streams and then it worked

381
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,210
and here's just the visual buffer and

382
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,070
then the next question was can you do

383
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,980
simple computer vision stuff in in the

384
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,290
browser can you do smoothing so here's

385
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,360
smoothing over over space but then also

386
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,970
between frames over time and it was

387
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,410
working and things weren't slowing down

388
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,410
too much Wow cool next edge detection

389
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,660
can I do can I do edge detection yes it

390
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,270
is possible this piece was like less

391
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,890
about art and more about is it possible

392
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,839
and so it was working and then we I put

393
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,190
it up at the show and like this is I

394
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,650
kind of see as v1 but like you can you

395
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,120
can imagine like you can hook up videos

396
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,560
to this you could put sounds to it

397
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,700
anything that's available in the browser

398
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,680
you can now use to the user with this

399
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,230
sort of thing but like you could get

400
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,150
edge detection live edge detection in

401
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,209
the browser cool so that was with node

402
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,220
connect and WebSocket streams and again

403
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,950
just canvas I learned about more about

404
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,420
canvas earlier so i can even met can

405
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,089
make this even more efficient i like to

406
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:31,990
play music so definitely i'd mess around

407
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,880
with Web Audio toys it's fun to do like

408
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,819
little

409
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:37,069
projects so when I got a leap like

410
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,239
clearly I would make a theremin like

411
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,889
everyone else did so this is a hit alone

412
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:50,559
thanks so that's that's this my mom and

413
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,789
here's like adding some filtering and

414
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,799
this is this is fun like maybe a little

415
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,169
stressful but like it's hard to really

416
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,479
share this so so saying okay what else

417
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:04,669
can you do okay minimal minimal graphics

418
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:06,739
minimal graphics in the browser with

419
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:10,290
sounds cool

420
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,960
you

421
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,260
Morgan ads I swear the next move as well

422
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,270
but for some reason i was using d3 for

423
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,860
this if you don't use t-34 this collar

424
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,210
application I don't know why I did it's

425
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,580
like learning and stuff so that was the

426
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,660
stressful and here's one that's more

427
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:35,360
relaxing

428
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,360
nice moment oh sure so like you know I

429
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,980
can show that and see what happened but

430
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,029
really like none of this stuff really

431
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:44,550
really compelled me until this came out

432
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,070
this came out recently like a month ago

433
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,190
it like went viral and it was like the

434
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:57,660
Wow cool that's growing this came out

435
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,300
and and it was amazing you press a key

436
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,540
and sounds happen and visuals happen and

437
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:09,839
then you could just play beads but the

438
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,699
real thing the real component part about

439
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,319
is that it would also work on mobile on

440
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,900
the mobile browser and before one when

441
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,339
you wanted to do stuff that was really

442
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,140
low latency you'd have to go native but

443
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,579
now you don't have to now there's a

444
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,650
whole new set of possibilities for for

445
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,990
multiple synth apps and quick gestures

446
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,280
that you could start exploring and this

447
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,410
this was incredible because like now I

448
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,610
could share it and people can play with

449
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,770
it and it's even more engaging than than

450
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,370
you know just on this so like you know

451
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,520
simple simple one-off experiments like a

452
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,910
pig Gator stuff or taking like previous

453
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,030
apps that i made like this one has your

454
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,970
mouse position becomes like the input

455
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,179
for a synthesizer and i'll ask tom okay

456
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,240
that's done uh and it's it's like really

457
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:04,120
minimal but um

458
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,810
basically

459
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,539
sounds

460
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:18,239
ok so there's something that would

461
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,549
happen with this we're like when people

462
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:21,869
started synchronizing with each other

463
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:25,110
it's start to get like you start to see

464
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,789
that behind this dot and the simple

465
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,549
sound there's a person and and that was

466
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:33,179
really amazing like like when two people

467
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,659
start to synchronize um you start to

468
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,700
form a language between each other and

469
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,039
this this taught me something new that

470
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,460
you can create these minimal spaces of

471
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,809
expression but really start to connect

472
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:47,489
with somebody else and it wasn't just me

473
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:49,230
that felt it like I went on Twitter to

474
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,549
see people talking about it and someone

475
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,049
wrote I just harmonized with somebody

476
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,859
but I don't know who is that weird and

477
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:57,539
someone else responded it's natural and

478
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,899
beautiful it's like oh wow cool this is

479
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:02,580
you feel is and so I'm imagining like

480
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,869
all these different little playgrounds

481
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:05,700
that are very very minimal very simple

482
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,350
you don't even use you know you're not

483
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,580
using words but where you can connect

484
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,019
with people in a very deep and kind of

485
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:13,820
intimate way oh yeah we did the demo

486
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,369
maybe we could do it again later okay so

487
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:20,279
that's how could I o Web Audio API I'm

488
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,109
going to end with something I've been

489
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:24,899
working on most recently and it was kind

490
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:27,359
of taken this idea of open web are more

491
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,249
seriously and being very open about the

492
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:30,869
process and just sharing about the

493
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,359
process and that deal was that you'd

494
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,100
have some sort of projection and yet I

495
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,629
have your phones and then when you move

496
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:38,399
them around something would happen there

497
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:40,980
it was very broad I didn't really know

498
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,210
what it would look like but I knew that

499
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,950
I didn't want the like this tapping I

500
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,929
wanted like moving so it would be more

501
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,460
about your body and not about looking at

502
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,429
a screen and so this first test was just

503
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:52,559
gestures to sound and it's like totally

504
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,220
hockey looking thing

505
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,730
and that was like that's like the best

506
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,919
icebreaker ever like people ask me what

507
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:13,409
do I do and I'm like this is what I do

508
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:16,549
and I posted on Facebook sounding all

509
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,909
serious like try it out and a few

510
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:21,230
minutes later I get a response holy crap

511
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,480
I just annoyed the entire room for ten

512
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,230
minutes of bliss OMG just holding on and

513
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,880
run around away from people chasing you

514
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,870
LOL cool so maybe there's something

515
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,850
about this but that was possible because

516
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,799
like they didn't have to download an app

517
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,419
I just shared this website in that

518
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,389
browser supports web audio and the

519
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:42,200
accelerometer and they could just use it

520
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,309
right away and then share with their

521
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:51,230
friends and I love that oh here's that

522
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,179
video from before ok now it's stopped ok

523
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:58,879
so oh yeah so then over the next few or

524
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:01,190
you know someone showed me a vine of it

525
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,480
on their laptop instead of their phone

526
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,370
cool didn't expect that you just take

527
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,549
your laptop and then because it looked

528
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:12,740
so bad I think people like hacked on it

529
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,539
made it their own built a better UI and

530
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,830
made it collaborative and I love that

531
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,539
love like that it was comfortable to add

532
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,850
to it but then I worked on it made the

533
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,309
sound a bit prettier and and added some

534
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:26,149
visual component so let me shake it and

535
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:28,549
then they're so these bursts and we

536
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:29,840
should play with oh hey here's another

537
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,360
video of like take it to a show and then

538
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,669
shake it around

539
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,249
like one of the people the show was so

540
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:38,869
pumped about it like I go to shows and I

541
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:40,220
just want to be a part of it now I could

542
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,869
be more a part of it and I like that he

543
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:44,029
felt that way so we could try this out

544
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:46,340
if you want to so turn up your sound and

545

is and it's hard to see where you are

556
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,070
right now but I think I'm the green one

557
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,940
I don't know

558
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,710
anyway that's all of us doing this thing

559
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,590
together and making these cool sounds

560
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:50,210
with our phones

561
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,710

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,200
had so many people on it that's fun

566
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,059
that's fun I think I'll make it brighter

567
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,520
or something I gotta you gotta you gotta

568
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,419
test for scale like this oh that's cool

569
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:17,159
you don't have to stop I'll kind of like

570
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,140
this in the background so that's this

571
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,549
uses a bunch of things Web Audio the the

572
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:25,799
accelerometer of course and then sparks

573
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,020
is on top of three and it's a particle

574
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,280
system library really fun to play with

575
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,530
okay so we all can send each other

576
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,539
messages and get to know each other on

577
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,730
the internet like it's a medium and just

578
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,080
in the same way as before I was like

579
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,580
curious of all right we have public

580
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,020
space we have public art how can this be

581
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,120
a means to to know each other in really

582
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,860
beautiful ways this can happen on the

583
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,510
web as well and we've seen it so many

584
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,950
times and that's kind of like what I'm

585
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,270
interested in exploring more I realized

586
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,770
why I'm so passionate about this at an

587
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,870
earlier talk in the conference there was

588
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,280
a line that really resonated with me was

589
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,140
in it was in gen stock create a space

590
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,880
for people to feel safe to be people and

591
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,710
I want us to think about this again

592
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,990
because it's really beautiful when we

593
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,789
were all hitting this ball in the air

594
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:11,370
and laughing and being weird like we

595
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,830
felt okay and it fell okay to be weird

596
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,539
and I think when you feel okay being

597
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,640
silly and playful you feel safer just

598
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,460
being who you are and so like with this

599
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,049
work all right how do you do that in

600
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:23,250
public spaces how do you do that

601
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,110
bringing internet to poke so how do you

602
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,720
just do it on the web and when you start

603
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,150
when you start seeing things that work

604
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,740
it gives us new channels to get to know

605
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,390
each other friends who you've known

606
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,110
forever like or new strangers it gives

607
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,429
you new ways to be expressive and

608
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:40,440
playful with each other and most of all

609
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,820
what's important to me is it gives you

610
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,159
like new ways to find joy new ways to

611
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,630
find happiness new ways to laugh and

612
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,299
smile together and for me it's that's

613
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,130
one of the most exciting pursuits in

614
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,470
exploring new technologies and that's

615
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,909
what I'm looking to do with with

616
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,950
JavaScript and networked apps and the

617
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:09,200
browser as a canvas thanks

618
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,770
and I you know obviously couldn't do it

619
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,090
alone so these are some some of the

620
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,800
collaborators for this work i'm gonna

621
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,790

623
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,170
well but i'd love to talk about ideas

624
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,520
and possibilities I've learned so much

625
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,920
