1
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:16,580

so yeah I'm Chris sv Jesus on Twitter

2
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,130
this is a nickname given me a SVG

3
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,020
conferences I totally hated it and then

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,849
eventually I needed a Twitter handle so

5
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:25,830
I thought okay why not

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,160
so as has already been mentioned I'm

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,630
technical director at the World Wide Web

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,789
Consortium w3c I work for Tim

9
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,010
berners-lee who invented the web

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,000
I started SVG in the sense that I wrote

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,559
the requirements document for it and got

12
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:41,720
the people together to who were all

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,430
competitors and convinced them that it

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,900
was better if they worked together on

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,699
something that would be open and

16
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:48,379
royalty-free rather than something that

17
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:51,110
would be proprietary like flash or

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,600
something like that

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,309
obviously that was mixed success for a

20
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:56,540
long time but there we are

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,640
and I also chaired the working group

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,070
that did that for the first few years of

23
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,970
his life before going to w3c actually I

24
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,250
was one of the causes of PNG when the

25
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,820
pattern thing came out on gif I was

26
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,110
incensed and joined some other people we

27
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,909
never met for years but we created this

28
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:14,990
format which seems to have been

29
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,440
successful and also in the CSS working

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,940
group I was the first chair of that I

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,430
was the editor or co-editor of CSS 2

32
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,770
which is where our font face came from

33
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,630
actually that was where he got dumped in

34
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,360
afterwards I was actually working on web

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,600
fonts before that and more recently css3

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,090
color co-editor and CSS for color as

37
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,350
well

38
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,350
web fonts I was the chair of an

39
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,330
ill-fated group that tried to get web

40
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,180
fonts going it failed because we

41
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,370
couldn't get agreement on a format we

42
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,190
could describe a syntax but basically

43
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,810
one company wanted their thing for

44
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,640
portable font resources to be their

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,010
format and other people wanted open site

46
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,780
which was brand new and wasn't really

47
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,400
guaranteed to succeed at that point and

48
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,840
we couldn't we couldn't get agreement

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,640
which basically meant that it failed

50
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,940
because you needed both parts more

51
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,760
recently I was involved in wofe one oh

52
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,069
and WAFF 2.0 which is still ongoing and

53
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:13,190
also chromatic fonts the idea of having

54
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,959
multicolored fonts on the web which is

55
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,250
the thing that you have in print we

56
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,340
don't have on the web and I want it

57
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,959
you'll be hearing more about that later

58
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,319
ok so that's me what am I going to talk

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,110
about

60
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,810
my talk is gonna be in four sections so

61
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,460
firstly some basics I want to make sure

62
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,020
that everyone's on the same page here

63
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,370
everyone knows what we're talking about

64
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,980
how many people here use web fonts on

65
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,370
their own their own site how many people

66
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,910
avoid them with all costs no excellent

67
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,410
that's quite interesting there was a

68
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,510
survey done by Google like the top

69
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,730
hundred thousand websites or something

70
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,220
and they found that 10 years ago

71
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,720
something like 2 percent of those

72
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,160
websites used web fonts in 2015 that's

73
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,300
risen to 50 we could do the cent deal

74
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,530
the second thing I'm going to talk about

75
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,690
is open type features and CSS how you

76
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,400
can use them so it's fine you can

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,020
download the font and use it but to use

78
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,020
it properly to use it well then a bit

79
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,430
about performance not too much

80
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,840
performance has been dealt with very

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,730
well by the speakers here and lastly

82
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,700
some crystal gazing on the future not

83
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,530
totally speculative stuff I'm involved

84
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,030
with stuff I think is going to be good

85
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,340
not stuff you can use yet but you will

86
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,320
soon I hope and of course the more

87
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,880
people clamor for it and say we want

88
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,110
this to be implemented the more the

89
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,549
browser's are likely to actually do

90
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,410
something about it in a reasonable

91
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,519
timeframe so basics and by the way this

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,930
picture here did people know what this

93
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,860
is the metal box yes what is it yes

94
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,330
that's right it's metal blocks that we

95
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,920
use to actually print on paper and

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,600
that's where the idea of an M Square

97
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
comes from you had all your letters on

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,350
an actual block of metal and the size of

99
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,660
it determined the overall layout of you

100
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,060
type we still have that concept in

101
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,690
digital fonts so first obvious thing is

102
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,750
what is a character what is it and it's

103
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,530
a number

104
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,110
it's a code pointer unicode code point

105
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,239
not just a code point though it also has

106
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,380
some properties so for example a is 65

107
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,229
but it's also the property of not a

108
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,860
number and not punctuation and has a

109
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,350
different case form things like that so

110
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,820
these are properties of characters

111
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,979
characters can be used without rendering

112
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,960
they can use for example in searching

113
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,060
they can be used in text-to-speech all

114
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,450
sorts of things like that

115
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,810
and then a glyph a glyph is the visual

116
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,280
representation of the character when

117
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,020
it's what you actually see on the page

118
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,710
are on print now I say character or

119
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,210
characters because there isn't a

120
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,920
one-to-one mapping that often is and

121
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,140
it's often enough that people tend to

122
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,520
assume that's always the case but it's

123
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,170
not especially in languages other than

124
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,970
English or in well set English actually

125
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,870
so hit quick test what are we looking at

126
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,580
here is this the character or is it a

127
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,090
glyph lift good yes how many characters

128
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,850
are there - and how many glyphs correct

129
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,350
excellent here's another one if this is

130
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,280
a glyph how many characters one any

131
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:32,650
advance on one two good both correct it

132
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,960
could be a pre complete it could be a

133
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,810
pre composed a acute or it could be an e

134
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,970
with an combining acute accent and

135
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,500
they'll be put together but either way

136
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,540
you'll get a single glyph which is the

137
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,240
thing laid out correctly so it's one

138
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,250
glyph and it could use two fonts

139
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,390
actually uncommon ly but it is possible

140
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,780
the next thing I want to introduce is

141
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,210
the idea of a font family and a font

142
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,480
face so here we've got myriad Pro which

143
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,030
is a font family and we've got some

144
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,580
examples of faces in that family alight

145
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,960
different weights but also an italic

146
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,700
actually in this case it's a oblique but

147
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,400
anyway and condensed and expanded forms

148
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,010
as well and I've got a second example of

149
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,290
Baskerville which again has various

150
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,060
different weights you notice that these

151
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,890
all have different names so the sort of

152
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,870
normal one it might be called book or it

153
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,430
might be called normal or it might be

154
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,230
called Deming Bolt or whatever it does

155
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,940
various there's no standardization on

156
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,980
these things at all which is why CSS

157
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,020
uses a bunch of numbers between 100 and

158
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,000
900 to represent weights ok next thing

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,790
properties and descriptors this is a CSS

160
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,230
conference I don't have to ask if you

161
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,420
know

162
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,660
property is but how many people if put

163
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,770
on the spot could tell me what a

164
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,840
descriptor is yes anyone willing to say

165
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,240
I could I won't ask you to just pretend

166
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,710
no okay so if you look on this code

167
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,770
sample we've got font weights twice both

168
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,500
times it says bold one of those is a

169
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,140
property and one of them is a descriptor

170
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,310
those are the descriptors on the app

171
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,310
font face I'm sorry about the name by

172
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,780
the way I was kind of stuck and I

173
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,980
couldn't think of a thing and I needed

174
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,480
something I wasn't property and it was

175
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,130
describing the properties were font and

176
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,050
I came up with descriptor and I really

177
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,670
didn't like it but we never never came

178
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:34,370
up with anything better so so a

179
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,950
descriptor is something that tells you

180
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,730
about an individual font face its weight

181
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,070
it's the range of characters it has

182
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,810
available things like that and a

183
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,510
property is a request for styling it's

184
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,220
something that goes on to some text on

185
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,650
to some elements on your page and asks

186
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,200
for something so basically one is a

187
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,480
question and one is an answer you see

188
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,190
yeah I can do that can I have this yes I

189
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,200
can do it

190
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,130
font stacks so you okay obviously you

191
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,990
all know that you can give not just a

192
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,220
single font but you can give multiple

193
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,100
fonts in a list and you probably know

194
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,900
that they the first one that actually

195
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,470
exists this is used right well actually

196
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,820
it's not it's the first one that has

197
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,370
glyphs that are needed which is used

198
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,650
which means you can have the second or

199
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,210
the third or the fourth on actually use

200
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,550
because the first one does exist but it

201
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,330
doesn't have what's needed

202
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,289
so here's an example this used to be

203
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,750
really common in email especially but

204
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,599
also on websites you get some text in

205
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,000
English it's been sent to you by someone

206
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,790
that speaks Japanese and he looks so

207
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,360
ugly why because they've set either

208
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,770
because of encoding the views or

209
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,360
whatever but they sent it in a font

210
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,730
which has got really good coverage of

211
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,290
Japanese obviously because they speak

212
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,720
Japanese and Latin glyphs frankly suck

213
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,029
so how can we use font stacks to avoid

214
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:06,370
that well quite easily you put the latin

215
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,500
one first and then you put the Japanese

216
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,180
one second and you get the nice laughing

217
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,490
glyphs and this worked well for a number

218
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,820
of years until people started saying you

219
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,800
know font designers Oh she'd add stuff

220
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,330
for European languages we should add

221
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,400
stuff for this and that and then they

222
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,260
went ah all those Japanese and Chinese

223
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,240
lives it's so big it's so hard oh but

224
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,350
they got these things called kana

225
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,089
they're quite nice and it's not very

226
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,950
many of them I'll add these to my fault

227
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,170
suddenly you're using the sucky can

228
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,839
athon runs from latin but you can't put

229
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,940
them both first you can't do that just

230
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,670
by ordering because you need something

231
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,950
else use something else do people know

232
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,720
what the something else is that gets you

233
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,610
around that problem good things on my

234
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,400
next slide then

235
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,760
unicode range how many people use

236
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,300
unicode range how many people have

237
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,870
looked at it and gone yeah it tells you

238
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,730
which range of unicode characters our

239
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,200
font is allowed to use so it's a

240
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,990
descriptor and you are allowed to lie

241
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,650
okay if you say it supports this range

242
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,330
of characters there's no you're not

243
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,920
making a promise that supports all of

244
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,230
them just that it has some within that

245
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,800
range and more importantly the font the

246
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,780
rendering system is not allowed to use

247
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,730
the ones that are outside that range so

248
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,290
you can block off things that you don't

249
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,600
want used you can effectively without

250
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,710
having to go to the trouble of

251
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,620
subsetting the font you can decide which

252
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,540
portions of it you wish to use but it's

253
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,190
very useful here's an example what we've

254
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,440
done here we've got a nice Japanese font

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,750
and we have subsided we want to have

256
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,360
this range of characters looking at

257
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,890
these numbers you can obviously tell

258
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,340
that the first one is yen the next one

259
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,560
is kanji the next one is katakana and

260
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,230
the next one is hiragana obviously from

261
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,600
the numbers right yes for something for

262
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,850
some things I mean like Greek or Turkish

263
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,430
or it's fairly easy you know Cyrillic

264
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,680
you can use this broad range of unicode

265
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,970
characters that correspond to a

266
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,800
particular thing but fathers this

267
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,180
scattered all over the place and this

268
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,580
really isn't a very good a very good

269
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,420
thing

270
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,510
I'm really sorry okay once again we

271
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,029
needed to make up syntax Unicode was new

272
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,940
everyone was using it with this u+ and I

273
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,650
thought well a bit of wild cards here

274
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,480
and some assumptions about leading zeros

275
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,060
and they'll be fine and it's really

276
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,770
horrible and I'm sorry I apologize it's

277
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,360
one of those mistakes that lives with

278
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,089
you three decades okay so let's see what

279
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:52,910
can you use Unicode range for you can

280
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,980
have a really small range and the

281
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,560
character to six is an ampersand for

282
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,960
example and you look at this and you see

283
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,550
I've got this and that and that's quite

284
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,170
nice I've got a sort of blocky swamp

285
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,800
serif and then I've got a curly curly

286
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,990
ampersand and you would probably be

287
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,390
tempted to say oh stick a span on that

288
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,210
put a clasp on the spine off we go no no

289
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,500
no no we don't have to do that at all so

290
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,820
here's the example let's see if we can

291
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:50,540
live code this without tears

292
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,800
this font was pulled Rockwell's that's

293
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,089
quite light by one and then lastly the

294
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:04,920
Unicode range of course it can be either

295
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,899
a capital u or a lowercase it doesn't

296
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:11,620
matter if I tend to just use uppercase

297
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,010
okay

298
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,240
nothing happened oh because we haven't

299
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,950
added the actual font into our font

300
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:27,540
stack so let's go ahead and do that

301
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:38,730
well it worked two minutes ago gee

302
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,560
I don't think it needs quotes actually I

303
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,760
was doing it happily without quotes

304
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,010
quotes I need it if you have spaces and

305
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,149
in particular if you have multiple

306
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:49,060
spaces I don't think I need that so I

307
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:56,410
don't know what okay well it honestly

308
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,209
did work and they worked multiple times

309
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,610
now I'm using Firefox here and I should

310
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,870
point out that I had to do something

311
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:09,160
special you have to sorry it's not

312
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,290
Rockwell right that's right if you helps

313
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:24,310
if you type the right actual name thank

314
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,730
you

315
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,589
yes so I did actually have to do

316
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:28,450
something special with this in any other

317
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,220
browser this would work just fine in

318
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,490
Firefox there is a seven-year-old bug

319
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,770
about Unicode range which they have

320
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,600
since fixed and marked as fixed and

321
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,640
which they have shipped behind a flag

322
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,970
which you have to switch on

323
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,910
but yeah it's coming it will be there

324
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,860
but just to point out that I did have to

325
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,270
cheat slightly and switch on a flag to

326
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,089
make that work okay moving swiftly on

327
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,040
the past my inability to oh yeah that's

328
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,990
what I meant to show you if you look at

329
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,940
the source of that you can see there's

330
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,620
no markup around the amp design I didn't

331
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,760
have to do anything I'm just using

332
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,100
Unicode range to select it so the

333
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,020
ampersand gets the first font and

334
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,399
everything else well there's only an

335
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,020
ampersand in there so they all get the

336
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:18,000
second fun okay good

337
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:24,400
so OpenType features here's some

338
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,050
examples of OpenType features you can

339
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,070
see this is using all sorts of fancy

340
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,760
ligatures and stuff like that so there

341
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,830
are optional stylistic features which

342
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,970
you can control with CSS I should point

343
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,950
out that fonts do vary in the features

344
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,330
they provide and this was always a

345
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,210
problem you don't know what in the days

346
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,590
when you had to depend on the fonts

347
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,030
being on the user's machine you didn't

348
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,230
know what features they had so you

349
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,360
couldn't really reliably use them well

350
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,220
once you have reliable font download

351
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,110
then you know what features are there

352
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,760
because you actually provided the font

353
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,260
yourself so I should also point out that

354
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,210
I'm using the syntax here in these demos

355
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,640
called font variant which obviously came

356
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,100
in in CSS too but has been much extended

357
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,430
in css3 fonts it's the better syntax

358
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,350
it's more understandable it's also

359
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,270
poorly supported and if you follow that

360
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,820
link there it goes - can I use basically

361
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,330
that currently means Firefox

362
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,650
there's also front feature settings

363
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,420
which are cryptic they use four letter

364
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,220
codes like SN P L they're very low-level

365
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,070
they're supported everywhere font

366
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,900
variant is merely a color it's merely

367
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,080
syntactic sugar for these things so why

368
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,020
the browser's don't just get on and do

369
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,520
it I don't know they've already got the

370
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,290
stuff they just need to hook it up and

371
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,910
you know it would help the poor

372
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,640
developers actually quite a lot if they

373
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,200
would do font variants so if you have a

374
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,330
bug tracker for a browser you like and

375
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,890
you tend to chase them up do you suggest

376
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,510
that they support fun variant because

377
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,340
they do listen to people complaining

378
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,100
repeatedly

379
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,920
okay so here's an example we've got some

380
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,500
text here and upper case text and some

381
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,910
numbers and you can see that the numbers

382
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,470
line up with the text quite nicely but

383
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,030
when we've got lower case tax which is

384
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,430
ascenders and descenders it doesn't line

385
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,370
up so well but we can fix that by

386
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,680
changing that to old-style numbers which

387
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,990
also have ascenders and descenders and

388
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,610
obviously you'd want to not do it like

389
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,110
globally like I've done here but you

390
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,340
would want to actually switch that

391
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,780
depending on what sort of takes your

392
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,370
hand so if you have your heading set in

393
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,620
capitals you set it to lining numbers

394
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:29,840
and

395
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:38,480
so on next fractions now I've got some

396
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,100
fractions here like a half and these

397
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,049
sorts of things there are code points

398
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,850
for that there's a code point for a half

399
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,789
and you might be tempted to use that but

400
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,650
it doesn't make searching very easy and

401
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,000
you're not going to find a code point

402
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,070
for 86 480 Thirds obviously so what you

403
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,529
actually want is to have your text set

404
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,620
with a slash and then you want to use an

405
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,179
OpenType feature called value nor

406
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:10,409
fractions just one property you're done

407
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:12,559
you obviously have to check that the

408
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,929
font has that feature increasingly now

409
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:16,490
when you look on font sites the

410
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,890
designers are promoting what features

411
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,310
they've taken the trouble to provide

412
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,240
here's another one this a table of

413
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,740
numbers you'll probably want to compare

414
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,779
the different numbers and looking along

415
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,370
the left-hand side you'll see there's

416
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,750
something that starts with a 1 and

417
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,669
something that starts with the 8 so you

418
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:36,020
might guess that the number starting

419
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,760
with H is probably a bigger one because

420
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,440
they eats bigger than one and they kind

421
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,120
of line up except they don't line up and

422
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,299
the colors don't line up because okay I

423
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:45,980
could fix this by setting this in a

424
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,659
monospaced font but then all the text

425
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,549
would look ugly well actually want is

426
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,809
proportional font for our text and

427
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:56,600
non-proportional numbers which I get

428
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,630
like this tabular numbers which means

429
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:07,260
they all line up in columns

430
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,710
here's another example I showed you this

431
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,620
font earlier so you notice I have a

432
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,860
little FL ligature which is quite nice

433
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,510
and apart from that it looks fairly

434
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,049
boring and if I switch on discretionary

435
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,460
ligatures then they got all this weird

436
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,919
nice stuff like that

437
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,860
the other value I can set is none which

438
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,929
switches off all ligatures it switches

439
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:35,870
off mandatory ones common ones and

440
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,970
discretionary ones basically do not ever

441
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,740
use this value unless you really want

442
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,230
that because you may break I mean Arabic

443
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,059
for example you have a laminate early if

444
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,559
you have to combine them in ligature is

445
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,780
required by the writing system switch it

446
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,100
off with that and people won't be able

447
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,280
to read your text so just remember that

448
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,760
the initial value is not none okay

449
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,990
font synthesis in an age where we can

450
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,940
make our websites use downloadable fonts

451
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,370
make sure you provide at least a couple

452
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,340
of waits an italic this sort of thing if

453
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,890
you don't the browser will synthesize

454
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,169
this for you it will slant your omen

455
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:17,090
over to make an italic sorry audience

456
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,640
slant your omen over to make an italic

457
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,309
it will make a fake bold this looks this

458
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:26,090
basically sucks and looks horrible so

459
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,150
what this property does is it tells the

460
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,919
browser when it's allowed to synthesize

461
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,840
and when it isn't because you may decide

462
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,820
that it's better to just use the Roman

463
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,960
wait everywhere

464
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,450
rather than have sucky born sake italic

465
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,460
so this is the initial value which is

466
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,650
the as usual with an initial value for

467
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,789
something that's added later

468
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,620
do what you do currently even if that's

469
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,400
not a good idea but we can set it to

470
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,380
wait like that so it's allowed to do

471
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,530
wait but not allowed to do italics we

472
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,030
can set it to style so it's allowed to

473
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,590
do italics were not allowed to do wait

474
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,080
oh wait it is doing wait why is it doing

475
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,370
wait that's because Firefox doesn't

476
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,110
follow the spec thank you and none which

477
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,419
is fine means done synthesize anything

478
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:12,690
and we can change that to different

479
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,200
different fonts and see what they do

480
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,100
what does this one do this is an

481
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,450
interesting one because it only has a

482
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:26,950
single weight and it's a bold yeah

483
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,140
anyway basically as things improve we

484
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,460
should see less and less of this

485
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,560
synthetic bold and synthetic obliques I

486
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,480
tell the key stuff which will be a good

487
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,960
thing for everyone I'm turning the

488
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,720
OpenType specification says that by

489
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,270
default kerning should be applied on all

490
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:53,030
texts quite a few browsers including all

491
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,060
the WebKit ones Safari and Chrome ignore

492
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,270
that and use a fast rendering path where

493
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:04,580
they ignore kerning whereas Firefox for

494
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,470
example and opera when that still

495
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,290
existed dude do the kerning now why is

496
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,160
that a problem

497
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,260
well two reasons firstly because you

498
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,370
don't know what you're gonna get you're

499
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,210
going to get different things on

500
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,010
different browsers and secondly you this

501
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,690
is the variability you want to actually

502
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,040
know what you're getting you want new

503
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,630
users to have consistent thing it will

504
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,490
cause different reflows even on the same

505
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,800
page the same width the same exact

506
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,280
dimensions so the default value for

507
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,620
Fanconi is auto which means do whatever

508
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,320
you do and I don't know what that is but

509
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,380
you can have a much more normal why is

510
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,110
it called normal it should be called do

511
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,430
what you're supposed to be doing but

512
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,230
don't really as something like this

513
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,080
anyway so on firefox this doesn't have

514
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,280
any effect but if i set it to none then

515
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,550
suddenly the things now don't confuse

516
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,250
kerning with letter-spacing do people

517
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,810
understand what the differences letter

518
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,850
spacing is the same an increment applied

519
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,990
to all the letters

520
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,660
whereas kerning means that the font

521
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,650
designer has said well I've got

522
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,850
something like this and something like

523
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,260
this so I can stick a little bit closer

524
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,940
together I've got two things that point

525
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,740
out so I need to push them further apart

526
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,110
it's so that the optical distance

527
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,120
between the letters between the glyphs

528
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,990
remains the same so let's play with the

529
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,370
let's play with the kerning a bit and

530
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,950
the letter spacing so yeah change the

531
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,680
letter spacing and that makes everything

532
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,880
go like that did you notice you can

533
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,169
those negative values and Goliath

534
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:36,019
don't do this in production code okay so

535
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,879
that was open type features a quick word

536
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:43,070
about performance the first and most

537
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,679
obvious thing you can do to Inc so first

538
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,749
of all don't do any of this unless you

539
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:50,210
need to right if your site is replete

540
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,759
with streaming video and huge images and

541
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:53,659
stuff like that

542
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:55,309
fonts are probably the last thing you

543
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,649
should be looking at that on a more lean

544
00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:59,690
website and depending on the range of

545
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,179
languages you're supporting you can

546
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,799
easily find you've got a huge font that

547
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,389
you're downloading and it's taking a lot

548
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:07,970
of time so wherever you get your fonts

549
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,590
from and this is an example from font

550
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,299
squirrel but other signs have different

551
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,669
things there's an online tool and you're

552
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:14,809
selecting the font and you're

553
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,190
downloading it locally it's same for

554
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,570
google fonts or whatever

555
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,710
there'll be subset options choose wisely

556
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,049
they try to shield you a bit from making

557
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,820
obvious mistakes so they group things by

558
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,860
language because obviously you can

559
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,019
subset part of the language you can say

560
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,139
just use the ascii range you know which

561
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,059
is great until you have you say well

562
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:36,740
they'd seek my science in english why do

563
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,539
I need anything else than ascii and then

564
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:39,710
someone with the French thing comes

565
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,210
along and they're eeeh cute comes from a

566
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,580
different font and it looks ugly don't

567
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,220
do that okay so subsets wisely but

568
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,049
getting rid of lists that you're not

569
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:49,730
using especially if there's a loss of

570
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,830
them in a big font really has the

571
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:56,840
largest impact on the file size so yeah

572
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,159
glyphs big savings open cite tables some

573
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,279
browsers as I mentioned don't do kerning

574
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,629
so you might want to get rid of the

575
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,960
kerning tables and you can save a little

576
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,960
bit of space and you'd be ill-advised to

577
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,169
do so why firstly because you can force

578
00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:16,549
it to do the kerning as I just showed

579
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,409
you

580
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:20,419
secondly because nowadays kerning isn't

581
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:21,889
done in a current able but it's done

582
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:24,320
using character classes in the Jeep a

583
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,659
stable and G paws table is also used for

584
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:29,539
things like other writing systems that

585
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:31,809
need special positioning like Indic

586
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:34,070
vowels that split apart and go around

587
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,440
the consonants and things like that so

588
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,570
if you drop the G paws table and a G sub

589
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,000
table then suddenly you'll break some

590
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,430
writing

591
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,780
systems so don't do that without

592
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,180
thinking about it and I gave some links

593
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,890
to few things I mean font squirrel type

594
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,400
yet and the last one is two thing called

595
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,140
font tools which is kind of a generic

596
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,360
names I said who's developing that

597
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,030
better dad it's a very good it's a thing

598
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,160
you can use from Python you can do all

599
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,660
sorts of cool things including

600
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,190
subsetting fonts second thing you can do

601
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,310
is use a compressed font format wofe was

602
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,340
developed specifically for that well not

603
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,790
just that but for that so what does wofe

604
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,570
do it adds a header which basically says

605
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,630
where all the tables are and the option

606
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,130
the answer metadata at the end now you

607
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,810
might think I'm supposed to be trying to

608
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,100
make this smaller why would I want to

609
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,130
add stuff and the reason is how often do

610
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,480
you go to someone else's website and

611
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,790
have a look at their CSS right you do

612
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,520
that a lot and sometimes it will depend

613
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,500
on particular fonts and you'll have a

614
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,850
look at those and you'll download those

615
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,640
too and can you use them or not you

616
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,040
don't know because obviously the font

617
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,510
may have been purchased it may have been

618
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,400
whatever it probably came in a zip file

619
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,260
complete with the license thing which

620
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,150
then didn't get uploaded onto the server

621
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,270
because why would you but if you have it

622
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,010
if you have some metadata that has a

623
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,010
link in the font to the license or to

624
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,900
the terms and conditions then you can

625
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,220
just follow it know whether you can use

626
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,480
it or not you find whether it's a free

627
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,010
font or what the conditions are so we

628
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,540
found that the foundries the font

629
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,130
founders are very happy with this idea

630
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,260
they didn't actually want digital rights

631
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,490
management or anything like that on

632
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,170
fonts they just wanted people to have

633
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,790
access to the information to know where

634
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,620
they can use or not if you're using an

635
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,870
you're not allowed to us between your

636
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,340
lawyers and their lawyers the browser

637
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,330
doesn't have to get involved and then

638
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,250
what wofe does is it's it's each table

639
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,540
gzip the tables are done individually

640
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,340
which with gzip happens to work quite

641
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,560
well but the overall result because it's

642
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,450
not a very specific type of compression

643
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,360
it's just generic compression it's not

644
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,720
all that great it helps gzip is used

645
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,280
because it's already in the browser it's

646
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,470
already used in the PNG format it's sort

647
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,210
of using the HTTP so we might as well

648
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,749
reuse it

649
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:56,759
one soif was established we then went on

650
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,389
to phase 2 which is doing it properly so

651
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:04,139
off to compression it's a lot more

652
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:06,509
complex the first thing it does is it's

653
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:09,389
split so open type is designed really

654
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:12,809
for ease of use for an application so

655
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:14,700
the stuff is laid out in memory with

656
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
lots of padding and stuff and things are

657
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,019
duplicated in multiple places the same

658
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:20,610
information is given in multiple ways

659
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,309
depending on what applications want to

660
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,840
use then that means a lot of it can

661
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,490
actually be recalculated you can throw

662
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,460
some of it away and then we calculate it

663
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,499
you can also there's different types of

664
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:32,999
data and if you put all the similar

665
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:35,460
types together it compresses better and

666
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,139
lastly if you use a compression

667
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:38,519
algorithm that's specifically designed

668
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,980
for fonts has been tuned for that you

669
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,889
get much better results apart from that

670
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,169
is the same as what fun so when I say

671
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:49,679
much better results the hundred percent

672
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,659
is the typical well that'sthat's your

673
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,879
uncompressed font rough one will take

674
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:55,409
that down to forty five percent of the

675
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:58,950
size and woth two will take it down to

676
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,200
32 percent for a true type font I'll

677
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,179
explain what I mean by that later so you

678
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,820
can see that yeah you you're grinding it

679
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,230
down you're getting your general a third

680
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,149
of the size so it's definitely worth

681
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:13,710
doing so off to with true type glyphs

682
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,720
which is the most common sort on the web

683
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,360
currently although that's changing gives

684
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,240
you 68 percent compression which is 25

685
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,570
percent better than wofe one if however

686
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,840
you have a postscript glyphs cff glyphs

687
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,210
you get mass good compression that's

688
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,610
because the the font specific

689
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,320
compression is able to do more with the

690
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,149
true time format it can rearrange data

691
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,960
and make it more compressible but it's

692
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,159
still worth doing it's still better than

693
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:46,259
what one I should point out that it's

694
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:49,529
not a free lunch there's a very talented

695
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,299
compression team that work on the

696
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,009
broccoli compression which is used in

697
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:56,429
wofe too and they're always saying oh I

698
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:58,080
got this a new improvement guy next to

699
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,090
naught point five percent it's like

700
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,190
keeping going keeping on it's great but

701
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,799
at some point someone said how long does

702
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,990
it take to decompress now this is

703
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,120
already an asymmetric compression which

704
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,419
means it's fast to decompress and slow

705
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,799
to compress which is fine because you

706
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,179
can press it once and shove it on the

707
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,669
server and millions of people hopefully

708
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:19,500
download it and they all decompress it

709
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,100
so you want that but what we found was

710
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,770
the last one or two percent squeezing

711
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,289
that down could double the decompression

712
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:29,700
size so you're making the font

713
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,529
fractionally smaller but not small

714
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,600
enough to really impact the download

715
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,330
time but then your pages hang in there

716
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,890
while all these fonts are decompressing

717
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,600
and actually if you would back off the

718
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,549
performance a little bit it's already

719
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:42,809
back off the compression a little bit

720
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:44,730
then you'd get a much faster page rate

721
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,130
over time this is more a note for us

722
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,919
rather than a note for you because the

723
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:51,029
the way that wofe is done there'll be

724
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:52,890
some command-line tweaks and stuff where

725
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,390
basically the default settings should

726
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,809
avoid this situation since I mentioned

727
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:58,649
performance on the mobile should also

728
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,480
say that we tested the memory use for

729
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,610
decompression and it's much the same as

730
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,559
well slightly larger but not enough to

731
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:17,039
worry about okay so if you have fonts

732
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,590
used on your site then you may find that

733
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,120
they're not loaded because you hadn't

734
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,309
got any text that uses them and then

735
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,200
when people enter text that uses them

736
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,600
there will be a lag because suddenly the

737
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,039
browser will say oh I need to download

738
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,440
that after all no Goffin get it which is

739
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,760
the point at which you step away from

740
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,770
CSS into the world of JavaScript and

741
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,450
force it to download the thing you know

742
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,179
you're going to be using so just to show

743
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,909
this isn't scary here's an app font face

744
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:44,279
rule which you cannot see and understand

745
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,620
and you know what it's doing and here is

746
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,669
a new font face object which as you can

747
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:53,520
see is basically the same thing and it's

748
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,960
declaring the font and saying I'm going

749
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,230
to be using this once you've done that

750
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,120
you can trigger it to download and you

751
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,760
get events which are promises you can

752
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,950
get one about when it bloating has

753
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,559
started when loading has finished or

754
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,730
when the loading has ended with an error

755
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,480
and what can you do with that well

756
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,690
you can then stick a little handler on

757
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,269
it when the promised returns use the

758
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:21,549
value and basically add a class to say

759
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:22,779
okay I'm going to use this font which

760
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:24,789
means if it fails you don't ever add the

761
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:26,559
class and it doesn't you try to use the

762
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,169
font that doesn't exist so this does

763
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:31,480
give you a lot more flexibility to do

764
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,929
things like that this is fairly new it's

765
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:36,789
supported in Chrome and opera and

766
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,070
Android it's not supported in the others

767
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,690
yet but it will be because this is

768
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,480
pretty useful stuff but I've put it here

769
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,630
because it is it's it's kind of new and

770
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,980
you might not know about it okay the

771
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,080
future the crystal ball the know I can't

772
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,840
use this yet stuff so the first thing I

773
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,210
wanted to talk about is colored fonts or

774
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,010
color type in general since this is

775
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,120
obviously isn't font this was

776
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,190
hand-painted by monks probably taking

777
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,250
years but illuminated manuscripts is one

778
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:09,789
driver

779
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,350
okay it's not driver nobody cares about

780
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,000
eliminating manuscripts it's just a nice

781
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,200
historical example the actual driver and

782
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,799
the real use case of course is emoji

783
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:28,120
which everyone wanted to use and at

784
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,860
first these were just little crappy

785
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,450
raster images and then people said no

786
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,130
works use a fond technology to do this

787
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,570
we're going to have to extend font okay

788
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,399
let's do that because we really want to

789
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,010
do these properly and have nice vector

790
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,779
effects for our emoji and let's get rid

791
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:42,610
of that you will thank me by the way if

792
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,899
you go to this page is a really

793
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,639
irritating soundtrack as well which I

794
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:48,399
had the thought to mute and here's the

795
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,330
third use case I saw a fascinating talk

796
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,919
at one of the international typography

797
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,139
conferences a type I there was a chap

798
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:58,179
who went around India talking to sign

799
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:01,299
painters because when people in a shock

800
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:02,919
like a fruit store something wants to

801
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:04,690
have a banner advertising themselves

802
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,059
they hire someone to paint the letters

803
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:08,500
on clasp and this is a photo I mean

804
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,379
these things are huge right and they

805
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:13,359
paint all the big doors hand-painted

806
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,159
signage and he asked them to design

807
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,859
fonts for him which they did and they

808
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:19,690
provided them on pieces of cloth in

809
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,659
multiple colors because that's what text

810
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,889
looks like right

811
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,419
and these are gorgeous these are

812
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:26,799
beautiful unfortunately these people are

813
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,299
going out of business because they're

814
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,789
getting replaced by you know a PC in a

815
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:34,089
laser printer or a vinyl printer but and

816
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:35,829
interestingly as well I mean this is

817
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:38,139
from India but also I was a couple of

818
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,269
months ago I was in Brazil another

819
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:41,710
typography conference and there was a

820
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,999
woman there who'd gone down the Amazon

821
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,069
and equally their assigned painters for

822
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:46,960
boats and things which have it also a

823
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,809
tradition of multicolored type so this

824
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:51,220
is an interesting thing it's a useful

825
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,499
thing to revive let's have a quick look

826
00:34:53,499 --> 00:34:56,349
at how we might do this so here's an

827
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:59,950
example this looks quite nice doesn't it

828
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,650
it's multi this is actually that same

829
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,579
thing that I just showed you on the

830
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,140
clasp but but done here on the webpage

831
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,019
and you might think well okay great you

832
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:10,329
can do it what's the problem and that's

833
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:12,880
the problem this is nine different fonts

834
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,579
all with different colors slapped

835
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:17,739
together using absolute positioning and

836
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:20,559
that also means that when you look at

837
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,970
the goods the markup you've got the same

838
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,529
text multiple times the same text

839
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:27,789
multiple times the same text multiple

840
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:29,109
times and that's really going to hurt

841
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:30,640
your search you actually might get

842
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,349
science blocking this because you've got

843
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:33,759
repeated text and they'll think you're

844
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:36,579
trying to spoof SEO and you just don't

845
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:40,989
want to do that at all so this is where

846
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:44,739
how we're doing for time nine minutes

847
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:47,380
sure okay quick poll shall I live

848
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,150
dangerously or shiny not this will take

849
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,420
about 90 seconds to two minutes

850
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,900
dangerous okay let's go for it

851
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:01,059
right so here R is the fonts that I was

852
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,630
using you can see this ten of them I'm

853
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,989
going to open this one up in trance type

854
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:09,489
then what I'm going to do is drop the

855
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:15,460
other ones also into trance type then

856
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,940
I'm going to select them all

857
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,900
and then I'm going to pick an effect

858
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,290
called overlay fonts and now I'm going

859
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,400
to pick some colors that don't suck and

860
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,079
I'm doing this quickly so actually they

861
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,150
will suck that's fine

862
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,900
basically the design of this is is

863
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,940
having four colors for the top and four

864
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,530
for the boss and this is really hideous

865
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:47,069
isn't it I'm sorry there we go that that

866
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:51,809
will do well do and say okay and change

867
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,910
the family name to something more

868
00:36:53,910 --> 00:37:01,140
sensible and export and let's put it

869
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:08,579
there for doom okay so let's see what

870
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:09,270
we've got

871
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,430
there's my fonts directory that I'm

872
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,400
using there's the kafeel now I don't

873
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,240
want it there stupid thing and it has

874
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,040
produced four different fonts why four

875
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,170
because there are four different ways of

876
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,950
doing this there's the way that Google

877
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,230
does it which involves using PNG images

878
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,740
all different sizes which kind of sucks

879
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,940
there's the way Apple does it which is

880
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,829
called s fix which is an undocumented

881
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,839
thing which also uses raster images and

882
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,780
it's also not very good and there's the

883
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,490
way that Microsoft do it which is using

884
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,069
stacked TrueType outlines and then

885
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:48,510
there's the SVG glyphs and OpenType

886
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,650
which is what I was telling you about

887
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,299
earlier okay so we have these four

888
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:57,960
things let us see if this doesn't work

889
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,049
then it's okay because I do actually

890
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:04,740
have a backup

891
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:11,200
quick look what did I do for this yeah

892
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,349
that looks what right doesn't it

893
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:23,390
okay and

894
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:31,329
okay let's quickly recover from that as

895
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:33,280
they say in cooking programs here the

896
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:48,640
ones I prepared earlier

897
00:38:48,650 --> 00:39:03,420
yes really do thank you

898
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,200
okay so this is the first format that is

899
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,229
useful it uses a an open type table

900
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:12,289
called color which holds a stack of true

901
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,089
type outlines the first one will be used

902
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:15,979
as a fallback if you eat color fonts are

903
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,930
not supported and then there's another

904
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,229
one called pal see pal which holds the

905
00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:23,150
palettes so you have you saw me

906
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,859
selecting the colors there those colors

907
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:27,739
go into the font itself and there's the

908
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:29,029
white actually that's the ones I picked

909
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:31,239
last time owners practicing this demo so

910
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,950
okay that works and this is just you

911
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,989
know it's a single line of text we have

912
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:37,630
got multiple lines or anything like that

913
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,859
so it's pretty good right it's working

914
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:44,380
well can anyone see a problem with it

915
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:50,690
yes the color property yeah exactly in

916
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,430
fact how do i style any of this we've

917
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,890
lost something haven't we where did the

918
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,390
styling go they have colors are now

919
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,059
baked into the font which is fine if

920
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:00,470
you're making your own fonts but if

921
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,849
you're buying them or something that's

922
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:09,019
really not very helpful is it so let's

923
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:11,690
have another option so SVG so you've

924
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,489
heard of SVG fonts right I didn't

925
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:14,719
mention them earlier but you've heard of

926
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,579
SVG fonts and you know that you

927
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:19,969
shouldn't use them ever okay good he was

928
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:21,710
a hottie was a temporary hack at a time

929
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,119
when we didn't have reliable

930
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,039
downloadable fonts okay it served its

931
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,719
purpose it had really terrible

932
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,579
internationalization it was only ever

933
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:30,319
intended as a throw away temporary

934
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,180
stopgap so don't use them they're

935
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,690
terrible so it's much the same you have

936
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,479
an SVG table which contains some SVG

937
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:40,489
which can do anything so I mean that's

938
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:42,410
the problem with the the previous thing

939
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,049
each each overlay is a solid color

940
00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:46,489
that's all you can have is a solid color

941
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:49,609
fill and then you've got C pal

942
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:51,529
optionally to have these palettes and

943
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:54,440
then you use CSS variables to alter the

944
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,109
palette so this is the neat this is one

945
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:58,729
of the other ones this is the SVG one

946
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:00,829
that I exported looks much the same I

947
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,450
mean here it's not using the SVG it's

948
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,009
not using gradients or doing anything

949
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:07,850
fancy it's just overlaid solid text

950
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:11,220
but let's see how we can do this so I've

951
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,750
used different colors here let's pick

952
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,050
something and make it really hideous

953
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:21,380
let's change the hue there and change

954
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:27,990
the hue there and maybe the saturation

955
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:34,440
and let's change that white to yellow

956
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,580
and yeah okay so we can using CSS

957
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,530
variables and these are pre these are

958
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,510
predefined in the spec it says you must

959
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,460
have them called color zero two color N

960
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,770
and they will correspond to entries in

961
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,780
the palette and you can therefore style

962
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,090
and the SVG ones themselves

963
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,800
you can't style the other ones though

964
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,680
the the TrueType ones they're not style

965
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,020
like that which is a shame but okay at

966
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:03,480
least this one works so it's now I've

967
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,370
been telling you about css3 fonts let's

968
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,110
talk about CSS for fonts which is

969
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,090
basically about two pages long and full

970
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,800
of jotted down ideas on the back of an

971
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,960
envelope one of which is a thing called

972
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,150
font palette so you can have multiple

973
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,040
palettes in these fonts you can have for

974
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,960
example one that's designed for text set

975
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,520
on the dark background and one on light

976
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,260
background so this lets you select

977
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,100
between available palettes also an app

978
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,530
palette entries function which lets you

979
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,300
override specific palette entries so

980
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,370
instead of relying on using CSS

981
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,080
variables and having the SVG actually

982
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,420
have var functions to call up those

983
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,610
instead it says no let's just override

984
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,280
the power directly just just override

985
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,990
individual palette entries and that's

986
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,880
how you would do that using app palette

987
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,470
entries lastly I mentioned font

988
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,660
synthesis already and said you can

989
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,670
switch off fake bold and you can switch

990
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,650
off fake italic there is another

991
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,870
abomination waiting to be killed which

992
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,690
is fake small caps and you do fake small

993
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,580
caps by taking a capital and squashing

994
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,080
it down and making it smaller which

995
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,610
means it's in there and lighter than it

996
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:06,960
should be compared to the other glyphs

997
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,790
that looks kind of ugly so this will be

998
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:12,810
a way to disable that too and lastly you

999
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,430
know about the font families you know

1000
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:17,050
the serif and sans serif and and

1001
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,020
to see has anyone ever used generic font

1002
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,240
family fantasy in a production website

1003
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,630
ever no I have no idea why we have that

1004
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:28,090
one is such a stupid idea anyway there

1005
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,280
will be some more there will be emoji

1006
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,730
there will be math and Fang song which I

1007
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,260
don't speak Chinese so I'm not quite

1008
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,790
sure this is but apparently there is a

1009
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,800
distinction which is relevant for you

1010
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,420
does anyone actually speak Chinese and

1011
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:46,150
can tell me what this means okay thank

1012
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,670
you

1013
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,960
actually if you could mail me afterwards

1014
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,550
with a longer explanation that would be

1015
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,580
great because I really do want to

1016
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,980
understand that okay so I think that's

1017
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,250
pretty much it yes indeed that's me as a

1018
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,020
reminder again these slides are up on my

1019
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,120
github so if you want to have a look at

1020
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,060
them then they are and I guess we still

1021
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,380
have a little a minute for questions in

1022
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,270
the declarations you're using you are

1023
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,850
limiting the fonts available to certain

1024
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,710
subsets are there yeah

1025
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,020
any API that scene with the requests or

1026
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,480
is limited on the client side is it okay

1027
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,490
but yeah that that day is not affecting

1028
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:28,320
the request now you can do that yourself

1029
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,690
okay what you can do is subset the font

1030
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,030
that you're using so it's called foo you

1031
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,220
can make food Chinese and food Thai and

1032
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,320
foo Arabic and whatever and then you can

1033
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,990
have multiple app font face declarations

1034
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:43,720
all of which have the same font family

1035
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,730
and all which has the same weight and so

1036
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,030
on but you use Unicode range and then

1037
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,530
what will happen is when the browser

1038
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,900
needs to fetch one of these it will and

1039
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,490
the ones that it doesn't need to it

1040
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:55,960
won't fact so depending on what the

1041
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,060
content is on your page you can it's

1042
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,620
effectively you can do your own sub

1043
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,110
setting and but still combine them into

1044
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,790
the same font family so on your actual

1045
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,890
CSS you just give the font family name

1046
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,350
and also if you combine that with font

1047
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,150
loading API you can force the ones that

1048
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,980
you know you're about to use to load

1049
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,540
earlier and these other ones as backup

1050
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,160
in case you know someone times in their

1051
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,630
name and it's in Turkish or something

1052
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,820
like that so that that is a good way to

1053
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,340
do it but yes it's not it's not it's not

1054
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,630
talking to the server and saying

1055
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,940
download subset this font for me and

1056
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,670
then then give it to me the Google Fonts

1057
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,630
API does that

1058
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,370
if you look what it does a and that's

1059
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,560
import you'll see that the URLs got a

1060
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,810
query part with basically which which

1061
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,880
ranges of stuff to use bear in mind

1062
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,260
though if you use that you're doing two

1063
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,090
HTTP requests the first one is actually

1064
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,710
getting in our font face in a stylesheet

1065
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,840
and the sixth line stylesheet and the

1066
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,250
second one is actually getting the fonts

1067
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,560
referred to from that but I believe

1068
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,210
Google is actually subsetting those on

1069
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,090
the fly when you do that does answer the

1070
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:59,590
question good yeah yeah I know

1071
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,790
ie seeks implemented the ad font face

1072
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:05,560
well all that all those years ago

1073
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,260
yeah um dude why did why did things sort

1074
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,480
of stall out for a long time with at one

1075
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,180
place okay that's a good question yes ie

1076
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,180
I think five point five even implemented

1077
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:20,470
at font face so at the time in even that

1078
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:23,440
meeting before okay so at the time this

1079
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,060
was at the time the browser Wars there

1080
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,700
were two browsers Internet Explorer and

1081
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,470
Netscape and they basically did

1082
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,000
everything the opposite way to each

1083
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,430
other so Netscape at that time hated

1084
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:34,810
style sheets they said they would never

1085
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:37,420
implement style sheets they used the

1086
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,430
link tag in the HTML which linked

1087
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,020
directly to a font and they would only

1088
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,970
accept one format which is called pfr

1089
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,070
portable font resource which was a

1090
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,430
proprietary technology from bitstream

1091
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,630
they rapidly gave her up when they

1092
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,580
morphed into being mozilla because then

1093
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,900
they had to open-source their stuff and

1094
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,040
they couldn't have all this code that

1095
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,330
was using proprietary things so they

1096
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:58,360
just dropped it meanwhile Microsoft did

1097
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,700
the the w3c standard way without font

1098
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,590
face but they were the only browser to

1099
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,950
do so so people kinda didn't care and it

1100
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,390
was using another proprietary thing

1101
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,580
called embedded open type which was

1102
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,680
using a font compression license from AG

1103
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,780
for monotype which was proprietary and

1104
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,720
protected by patents so nobody would

1105
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,300
touch either of them and that's why I

1106
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,630
failed because there wasn't an effective

1107
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,460
Universal download mechanism for the

1108
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,080
font there wasn't a format we had a

1109
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,000
syntax but only one browsers using it

1110
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,310
and we didn't have a format it was SVG

1111
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,840
fonts the reason they took off is

1112
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,000
because they use the same syntax but we

1113
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,130
also mandated in the SVG spec you can

1114
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,750
support any font format what you want

1115
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,420
but you have to support SVG fonts and

1116
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,160
SVG fonts use the exact same

1117
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,740
path syntax as SVG does so the

1118
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,490
incremental cost to implement was small

1119
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,619
and so people people would do that and

1120
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:52,329
they worked for a while its stock gapped

1121
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:54,010
us he was okay I mean at that time

1122
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,020
especially on phones if you had SVG on a

1123
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,700
phone they often had no access to the

1124
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,440
fonts they were on the platform they

1125
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,329
would kind of sandboxed so you had to

1126
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:02,890
send down a font with it and so that

1127
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:04,720
worked but that was just on phones on

1128
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,369
feature phones and stuff this was before

1129
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:08,260
you know the the good phones before

1130
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,380
smart phones and on the desktop things

1131
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,299
languished until we had an operation

1132
00:48:13,299 --> 00:48:15,490
people said we have to have a single

1133
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,470
font format that everyone supports and

1134
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,839
we people got behind that the foundries

1135
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,980
got behind her it was incredible about

1136
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,869
2006 or so I still have a really ratty

1137
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,660
t-shirt from a 2006 fun thing which I

1138
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,549
took because people getting up on stage

1139
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:33,760
and saying we are the last generation of

1140
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,819
typographers the web will kill us all we

1141
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:38,680
were will be selling peanuts on the

1142
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,859
streets etc two years later these same

1143
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:44,559
people were saying our entire font

1144
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,210
library is now available both the web

1145
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,130
and for print you can buy it on the web

1146
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,140
you can buy on print you'll require two

1147
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,059
different licenses we get to sell the

1148
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:56,000
same font to people twice this is great

1149
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,940
that's what it took I mean there was a

1150
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,470
lot of suspicion between the browser

1151
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,369
people and the font developers and

1152
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:04,569
getting them talking to each other was

1153
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:06,520
which is the sort of thing that w3c does

1154
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,710
getting competing industries to talk to

1155
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,660
each other and agree on a standard that

1156
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,240
was what it took actually all right

1157
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,789
thank you Chris I'm sure you could fill

1158
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,559
a whole other conference with all of

1159
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:33,690
those thank you so much
