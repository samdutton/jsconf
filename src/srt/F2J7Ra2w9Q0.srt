1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,549

all right you guys what do you guys want

2
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,109
to talk about today I can do two things

3
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,600
for you I can do both or I can do one at

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,140
a time or I can do one we can build a

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,970
light box or we can add a character

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,990
counter kind of like the Twitter web

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,949
page or we can do both you're gonna do

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,360
frameworks or without just using jquery

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,870
yeah you must see the light box all

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,770
right so I'm Jonathan Julian I have this

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,039
code it's going to go up in this github

12
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,719
repo so that if you're interested you

13
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,949
can pull it back down and look at it and

14
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,800
play with it when we're done it's it

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,420
might not be beautiful so it probably

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,739
would need more work to be production

17
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,109
ready but just to show some examples of

18
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,750
how easy it is even or first thing in

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,060
the morning to build your own light box

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,720
for example it's not too hard so

21
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:19,420
here's our code for this page and

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,620
basically here's the use case that we're

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,990
thinking of your boss says to you hey

24
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,330
are our homepage it has this login form

25
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,740
on it we want to make it like super cool

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,850
and have it come up in a lightbox

27
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,380
instead of being sitting there on the

28
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,690
page all the time so you say okay I can

29
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,580
do this on matru sively I can leave this

30
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,490
here for non JavaScript browsers but

31
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,600
when somebody comes along with

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,680
JavaScript we're going to take it out of

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,090
the page will show it on a lightbox so

34
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,110
I'm just going to go through and code

35
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,180
that and if anybody else has ever done

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,380
this before maybe you could help me out

37
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,150
I'm just going to the resolution is

38
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:56,300
really wacky so first thing we want to

39
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,970
do here I think is we want to take this

40
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,700
login form using jQuery take it out of

41
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,890
the flow so first we'll add jquery to

42
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:19,840
the page

43
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,440
if you have any suggestions or if you

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,880
want to help me out or holler out stuff

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:34,550
go ahead yes becomes do if you want to

46
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,370
speak in a low yeah you're really losing

47
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:44,030
all right so when documents ready will

48
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,170
do all this fun stuff ray you know what

49
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,900
if you have a 3.5 to 3.5 I could hook it

50
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,160
up I have speakers but I just don't have

51
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,380
a ipod cable real bummer like some

52
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,300
Mossad like some massage casual kind of

53
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:06,950
you know alright that was the login form

54
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,910
I think so yeah there we go login forms

55
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,590
out then let's turn this right here into

56
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,570
a link so that when you click this that

57
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,690
launches the lightbox what was it called

58
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,000
login to put an ID on it yeah thank you

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:51,280
play some music

60
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,209
just for the record this is being

61
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,989
recorded and everything there's exactly

62
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:05,510
five people other than me in the room so

63
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,769
what we're going to do when this link is

64
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,230
clicked let's show the format well we

65
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,370
don't only exactly show the form right

66
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:21,190
away but we could

67
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,390
see how this works I need to put the

68
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,890
link in that's a pee I don't want to

69
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,000
change the page as part of the goal here

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,460
I want to do this totally untrue silly

71
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:42,550
so let's take that login link and jam in

72
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:50,510
the nature of a href in there this will

73
00:04:50,510 --> 00:05:02,920
work right

74
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,820
there we go

75
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,350
okay so that's the beginning stages of

76
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,390
actually hiding what we want to show in

77
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,540
the light box but then showing it when

78
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,970
we click so light boxes have there's

79
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,350
three main components to your lightbox

80
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,210
you have your page which is at z index

81
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,920
whatever and then you have the overlay

82
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,380
which is the z-index above that and you

83
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,430
have what you want to show in light box

84
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,990
which is the Z necks above that so we

85
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,440
need to build and overlay and we're

86
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,970
going to put that login form into the

87
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:53,510
top feel free to move about oh please so

88
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,380
let's build an overlay I meant for this

89
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:09,679
to be in here but doesn't really matter

90
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,819
we're going to make sure the overlay is

91
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,289
hidden when the page starts up and the

92
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:18,979
overlay we're going to build as an

93
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,629
absolutely position div that takes up

94
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:30,070
the whole screen

95
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:44,150
see top 0 left 0 width 100 width 8 100

96
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,110
and what else we need a background color

97
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,420
let's make it black and we're gonna put

98
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,430
an overlay on this and someone told me

99
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,990
point six is a good number for an

100
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,640
overlay but you can use anything over

101
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,530
with overlay Oh past city point seven I

102
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,470
hear from the crowd is the right number

103
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,040
for your opacity and we want to make the

104
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,470
z-index above everything else on our

105
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,060
page so depending on what else we have

106
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,980
going on usually pick a big number like

107
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,630
90 um let's see what's going to happen

108
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,180
here we're not showing it yet so there's

109
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,880
the overlay and it's hidden by default

110
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,420
so we're going to show it with the login

111
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,239
form

112
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:40,019
now when we click it'll look the same

113
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:46,830
when they come out walking home

114
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,070
position you need to visit yes exactly

115
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,310
the top and the left were meaningless it

116
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,349
was still invisible until we positioned

117
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:00,169
it so now that's better so now we have

118
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:01,550
an overlay of point seven over top of

119
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,139
everything on the page not exactly what

120
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,900
we want we want this to pop out so let's

121
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:12,530
do that next the login form which is

122
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,860
hidden I like to there's many ways to do

123
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,889
this I like to do it this way add a

124
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:28,860
style to it

125
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,300
absolutely add class add that class to

126
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,830
it and then here I can select login form

127
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,870
but not always only when it has the

128
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,390
class of light box so this is going to

129
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,330
work normally when no javascript than

130
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,190
when there is JavaScript you'll see the

131
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,150
lightbox tiles and here we will set Z

132
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:57,690
index of 91 and we'll also position this

133
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,240
to get it above the lightbox div and

134
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,200
let's do top 0 left 0 see how that looks

135
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,880
not perfect when you put a background

136
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:19,630
color on it

137
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,650
better so we're not doing any design

138
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,690
today because that's just that's too

139
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,360
much thinking for this early you want to

140
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,950
have your design or position this

141
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,140
somewhere else and etc etc but we've got

142
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,160
the underpinnings of the lightbox what

143
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,450
if the user decides to get out of here

144
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,650
what do they do when we need to cancel

145
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:51,810
button you want to take a minute where

146
00:09:51,810 --> 00:10:07,119
we got here modified

147
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:11,250
ok

148
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:19,040
we're good should I push it all right

149
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,340
cancel button again trying to be

150
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,350
unobtrusive what I'd really like to do

151
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,210
is add the cancel button right here next

152
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,740
to the button I don't want to put it in

153
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,790
the form manually which will be easier

154
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:41,320
so we can since we're in here login form

155
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,520
adding the class of light boxing we can

156
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,500
just append it in here I think we can

157
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:54,780
just do this all right

158
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,310
and we need to put a either an idea or

159
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,090
class on this we can say let's call it a

160
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:09,550
class classes canceled

161
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,590
now we have a cancel link there's a

162
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,610
great vibe in here this is really good

163
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,680
it's really cool all right what are we

164
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,990
gonna do with that cancel link let's

165
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:31,130
attach a handler turn I hope so I hope

166
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,420
so and there's a total of six people

167
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:39,279
here to witness it 60 the room is packed

168
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:51,350
backup sleep all right when that cancel

169
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,580
buttons pressed let's just get rid of

170
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,980
all this stuff both of these the overlay

171
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:02,680
and the form hide fast

172
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:13,470
gone cool so that wasn't much good I did

173
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,589
that in eight minutes or them um yeah

174
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,310
bit it well there's one more thing

175
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,420
there's one more thing that I thought

176
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,100
would be really cool here is you know

177
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,600
sometimes when you're using like a

178
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,070
desktop app and you hit escape and it

179
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,060
kind of like dismiss is what you're

180
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,500
looking at that would be really cool

181
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,589
wouldn't it how do we do that all right

182
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:40,470
I'll figure it out cool all right so um

183
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,290
you can have being a blip on the overlay

184
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,260
oh that's an awesome idea yeah that's an

185
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,740
awesome idea let's do that why don't we

186
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,980
do cancel comma overlay now wherever you

187
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,170
click cancel or overlay it makes it go

188
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,370
away nice nice I'm gonna raise you I'm

189
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,630
gonna raise you a double effect how

190
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:20,230
about that let's make the login form

191
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,959
fade out fast and then chain to that

192
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:33,430
have the overlay

193
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:47,940
fade out

194
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,360
cool let's get back to the key press cuz

195
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,610
that that's kind of fun I think there's

196
00:13:52,610 --> 00:14:02,450
a couple ways of doing this oh gotta

197
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:07,230
commit lightbox but what did we just do

198
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:15,890
added cancel and other cool we're

199
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,150
good now the key press so what should we

200
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,210
listen on should with us in on window I

201
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,060
know if done this one window before and

202
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,340
key up just to save some time key up is

203
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,730
the more fun way to do this key down you

204
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,990
know that doesn't happen right away it

205
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:38,870
key up is the cooler way to do this so

206
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,120
this is how I poked around and figured

207
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,370
out what the key code for escape is

208
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,840
anybody know what not you because I know

209
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,880
she knows they might knew what the key

210
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,690
code for escape is alright so i don't

211
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,520
have to console log it i can just do it

212
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,810
i need to pass the event in here let's

213
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,650
capture that the key code triple equals

214
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,880
twenty-seven then let's do this same

215
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,840
thing

216
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:19,230
will it work that was the Escape key

217
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:27,490
this is the Tiki nothing so good let's

218
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:40,540
commit that

219
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,050
my use my say-so just committed

220
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,600
everything this is this is my first

221
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,160
presentation I've done with live coding

222
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,899
and it's surprising how little I look

223
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,910
around just kind of staring at my

224
00:15:50,910 --> 00:16:00,350
keyboard I feel like an introvert okay

225
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,230
just just just commit at all just come

226
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:16,340
in at all

227
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,620
alright so everybody's cool with that

228
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,970
I'll push it and you guys can pull it

229
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:31,199
down for kit make it better

230
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:34,540
and and there it is who needs a fancy

231
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,839
box yeah the jpg I bring plug-in make

232
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,959
sure it covers out like it's just too

233
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,800
much it's just too much for right now

234
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,069
this works when we look when we launch

235
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:52,509
will need to fix those problems all

236
00:16:52,509 --> 00:17:01,629
right let's move on to the next one the

237
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:04,419
character counter let's go to Twitter

238
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:09,970
first because everybody news about this

239
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:17,260
right here so situation number two that

240
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,809
will go through is your boss says hey

241
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:21,399
this twitter thing is really cool you

242
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:24,760
know our fields on our account info page

243
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,250
can only be so long let's tell our users

244
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,630
where we are where they are and how many

245
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,520
keys they have left because right now I

246
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,020
have no idea how many keys i can type

247
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,419
into the bio section i have no idea how

248
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,279
many keys how many letters i can type

249
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:39,909
into my username so this is going to be

250
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:46,179
even easier than the lightbox here's the

251
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,950
code for character counter it's just a

252
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,549
simple form first thing we need to do is

253
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:54,850
add a little bit of markup to say how

254
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,529
many characters are left so let's do the

255
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,470
bio first and after the text area will

256
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:09,640
add let's see add a span and we're going

257
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,980
to make sure that this works pretty well

258
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,510
so we're going to name it very similarly

259
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,640
to the text area so the text areas ideas

260
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,059
bio so we'll name this bio counter and

261
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,080
within here we can put the count but

262
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,899
like Twitter does but it might be likely

263
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,490
that somebody says hey i want to say i

264
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,590
want to show cool message like you have

265
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,720
x characters remaining so let's do it

266
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:47,529
that way since a little harder

267
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,340
and we'll pre fill it because we know

268
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,070
that for example the bio can only hold

269
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,749
50 so that's what it looks like for non

270
00:18:56,749 --> 00:19:01,399
JavaScript clients and the the copy

271
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,529
really doesn't fit because it's not

272
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:06,220
updating right now but you get the point

273
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,759
now let's update it first we'll put

274
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:25,240
j.crew viewing the page again

275
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,840
and then we're going to attach another

276
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,310
key up and this is actually really fun

277
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,930
to do with key press and key down just

278
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,040
to learn a little bit about key events

279
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,210
key down you'll get more events but

280
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,850
you'll get them later or earlier so your

281
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,040
account won't be reflected using key up

282
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,140
is better in this case because you

283
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,670
actually get the count after the key is

284
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,960
shown to the user so the user starts

285
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,640
typing their name and they type B and

286
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,860
then the count isn't reflected after the

287
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:10,490
B shows in the screen so

288
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,130
what's the name of that bio it's just

289
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,810
called bio so we're going to attach to

290
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:27,300
the bio text area p up handler and in

291
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,240
that handler we are going to update the

292
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,300
span within the similarly named bio

293
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,090
counter with the number of characters

294
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,140
remaining so we need to do a little bit

295
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,230
of text manipulation here we know that

296
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,020
the name of this is bio so we are going

297
00:20:46,020 --> 00:21:00,690
to look for the element with the ID of

298
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:09,360
this ID which is x 0 plus counter and

299
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,000
actually will update the span within

300
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,400
that with the count what's the count we

301
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,450
can get the count a couple different

302
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:31,090
ways we can say this dot Val so true dot

303
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,790
length so let's say the max is 50 so

304
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,370
let's say 50 minus this dot valid at

305
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:45,090
length is that going to work ok cool

306
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:51,100
first shot that's good ok so it shows

307
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,150
how many characters we have remaining

308
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,480
when we get down to zero it goes

309
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,580
negative which is actually pretty useful

310
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,140
I think and we don't have to think about

311
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,300
this but you know it's it's cool so if

312
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:12,610
it's less than zero let's see if the

313
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,910
count

314
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,800
is less than zero let's do something

315
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:28,670
interesting let's set a style on here to

316
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,280
turn that red over here to turn this red

317
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,300
so when it's under zero then it's

318
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,820
telling the user hey this is uh you're

319
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,900
not going to be able to submit this it's

320
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:47,090
not gonna work so um yeah this could get

321
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,260
cleaned up a little bit but we use the

322
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,000
same selector this could be cleaned up

323
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,750
with some local variables and we'll just

324
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,730
call it like over count maybe and if not

325
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:10,280
then we'll move over count we have to

326
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:28,850
define over count

327
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:39,640
how's that look

328
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:45,030
not what I wanted but close

329
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:52,960
I really wanted the whole text all right

330
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,020
so we have a few minutes left and with

331
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,590
that few minutes will actually do

332
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,690
something a little bit harder if you

333
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,990
guys are ready for it I'm going to do a

334
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,290
closure we're going to do a closure I'm

335
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:20,630
just telling you ahead of time so this

336
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:28,210
isn't it let's look at the let's look at

337
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,570
this okay so so the next thing you're

338
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,300
asked to do is also put this on the

339
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,090
username field and you're like that'll

340
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,130
be easy i'll just copy all that code but

341
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,600
then like the senior developer on your

342
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,780
team says hey don't do that we're going

343
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,890
to reuse the code we're not going to

344
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,700
copy the code so not here this one the

345
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,080
username counter so this is what you

346
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,660
have to do you have to add a user name

347
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,970
counter and this one can only take 10

348
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,560
characters so you can't use the exact

349
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,400
same code anyway so we're going to take

350
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:07,170
this entire chunk here this function and

351
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,010
I just pulled it out to define it as key

352
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:18,760
counter

353
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,240
and that as it is should work the same i

354
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,970
just took key counter out to a function

355
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,370
and i'm referencing the function the

356
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,090
same way so it should work the same way

357
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,080
for bio and it does so here's where the

358
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,660
closure comes in we want to reuse key

359
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,330
counter and we had this these 50s all

360
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,800
over the place so let's pass that in as

361
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,120
a parameter and call it max and then

362
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,410
down here we can't just pass in 50

363
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,840
because that whoops that actually calls

364
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,810
key counter so it's the hardest thing

365
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,040
we're going to do today before nine

366
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,220
thirty need to build this to return a

367
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,120
function that encloses that 50 so that

368
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,220
it can be used as the handler and the

369
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,070
way to do that is really easy we are

370
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,750
going to make key counter not actually

371
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,370
do the work of doing the counting but

372
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,320
return a function that does the work of

373
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,720
the counting because just wrap

374
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,590
you

375
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,580
and the first suggestion from the crowd

376
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,740
that actually makes awesome sense I like

377
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,780
it a lot just trying to do a little work

378
00:26:38,780 --> 00:27:00,110
that it's not as pretty

379
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,680
here might be that this might be the

380
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,570
deciding factor here when we do this how

381
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,860
does that look how does this hit you

382
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,290
they have two blocks like this if we did

383
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,090
it without the anonymous function then

384
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,060
it would just be one liners so either

385
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:21,750
way let's see if it works no it does not

386
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:29,770
no it does not all right what did we do

387
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:38,930
wrong we didn't find this all

388
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,450
inside that the key count inside of the

389
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,410
anonymous function yeah and I still have

390
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,510
it taking a max in here because I

391
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,000
started doing it one way and then

392
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,820
they'll find it haulmax but the key

393
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,970
counter all right there he's say okay

394
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,040
let's just for complete list

395
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,850
completeness here let's do it the other

396
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,370
way which would be to would be to return

397
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:21,480
a function see how that looks

398
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,950
so now key counter takes in max as a

399
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,700
parameter returns a function that refers

400
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,130
to max so there's your closure and now

401
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,899
that anonymous function is returned back

402
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:36,889
to be the handler and let's hope this

403
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:44,850
works

404
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:51,380
extra

405
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:56,310
indeed where's my console when I need it

406
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:00,850
hey that's better and this one works
