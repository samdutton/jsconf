1
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:31,140
\{Applause\}. Cool. Can everybody hear me? Ok,
cool I can hear me, awesome. So, just before

2
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,090
we gene I'm quite a connoisseur of the animated
gif and just in an attempt to be inclusive

3
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:44,980
- you see that on the slide it means the next
slide contains a gif, if you suffer from vestibular

4
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,410
disorder or something that would make a uncomfortable,
look away, listen to my voice, it's lovely,

5
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,220
interesting and ethnic \{Laughter\}.

6
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:01,530
I hope that makes you feel better and doesn't
spoil your enjoyment, the next slide is animated,

7
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,229
this is how I feel after four days! \{Laughter\}
.

8
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:13,360
So I like to relax before doing a conference
talk, so I like to make you move, after four

9
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,100
days of sitting down, yeah, probably going
to help. So, hello I'm Lewis Cowper, both

10
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,680
in life and pretty much everywhere on the
internet and I just want to chill out for

11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,350
a bit. .

12
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,100
So, you have heard a lot of fantastic talks
and I hope you have had a chance to meet fantastic

13
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,500
people and chat to the sponsors and speakers
after the talks, but I would really love you

14
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:45,700
to stand up for me. Feel free, have a little
dance, little shake off. Everybody take a

15
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:53,469
deep breath and just hold, it nice and slow.
Now on 3, I want you to blow there \{toward

16
00:01:53,469 --> 00:02:00,170
the screen\}. 1, 2, 3, go!! \{Laughter\}.

17
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:09,619
Wasn't that nice, just relax, it's ok, don't
worry. So, yeah, forklifts and all that. Feel

18
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:10,520
free to sit down.

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,060
Have a glass of water and just enjoy at the
moment.

20
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:25,620
So, forklift driver to developer in nine months.
I'm@Lewis Cowper, pink sparkly heart JSConf,

21
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,870
please feel free to comment after.

22
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,600
Picture the scene, you wake up, it's still
dark, you fall into clothes, you open the

23
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:43,630
door to leave and would you look at that,
it snowed. Your job doesn't allow remote working,

24
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,170
your job doesn't require a WiFi connection
and you are not sitting in front of a

25
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,920
computer, you make the best of it, put a fleece
on, gulp down some tea, we're in Britain and

26
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,250
that's how you warm. This is your work, recovered
steel pipe most probably from the oil rig

27
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:14,510
or field, the ones on the left 5 inch, the
big ones 9 and 5 eighths, in Britain we deal

28
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:22,100
with Americans, all the sizes make me feel
uncomfortable, your biggest asset is probably

29
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:28,090
one of these, that bundle right there will
weigh around 3 to 4 tonnes, if you try and

30
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,740
pick them up it doesn't work! \{Laughter\} .

31
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,710
So, oh and if you drop that, I've discovered
as well, steel pipe beats ground, so add that

32
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:48,540
into the rock, paper, scissors thing, steel
win!! And you can break things really easily.

33
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,940
So your job is to move these to your working
area, where you are going to cut the pipe

34
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,930
with something like this. This is, I desperately
tried to find a picture of my actual machine,

35
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:07,250
but my machine was in a small hut and was
not nearly that clean and yeah, just generally

36
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:16,229
a bit grimy, we basically built a iron shed
around that with two massive holes in the

37
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:24,650
side for the roller beds, so it your job is
manual and really repetitive, it's varied,

38
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,130
sometimes something breaks and then you have
to fix it.

39
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:35,729
\{Laughter\}. Some correlation. It gives your
brain a lot of free time when you can just

40
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:41,460
switch off mentally at your job, I spent a
lot of time analysing my work. So if one cut

41
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,840
takes x amount of time, how long would 1384
cuts take, no one bias an even amount, they

42
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:59,330
by buying distance, it's 1.88m, if I can get
out 7 out of a 12, it's better to drag out

43
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:07,340
the longer pipe, soon enough my note bats
looked like this, my colleagues, who were

44
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:14,540
less maths minded than me, thought I was Russell
Crow in a beautiful mind! \{Laughter\} .

45
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:24,660
I love computers, I played with them for number
of years, I like to think it was my analytical

46
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:33,280
mind that led me to programming or kept it
fresh. I did the basics at school and tried

47
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:42,510
to go to university for computer science I
was from a very small time, so I spent a lot

48
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:49,790
of time doing what we have been doing for
the last few days, staying out late and partying,

49
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,330
I signed up for an OU degree, computer science
and design, soon as I got into second year

50
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,430
and introduced to Java, I didn't find it particularly
engaging, I felt like I was learning in a

51
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,180
bubble and without an atmosphere of a classroom,
I didn't seem to be able to focus and understand

52
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:14,560
why I had to type public stack void main every
time and I still don't. I just wanted to make

53
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,970
a lot of things happen with my computer, not
learn a lot of key words to get around. My

54
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,490
luck started to change, in the next city over,
ten miles away, they were programming meet

55
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,990
ups, people got together in their spare time,
unpaid, talked about programmering and taught

56
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,750
people stuff and asked questions, so combine
people with enthusiasm for teaching and people

57
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:42,610
who want to learn, the fen diagram is basically
the same, everybody wanted to teach and everybody

58
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,430
wanted to learn, it was fantastic.

59
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:52,860
It was going to be a crowd and you have to
say the right thing at these meet ups, you

60
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,230
have to know the lingo, so I said public stack
main void before I ordered a drink and everybody

61
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:07,860
laughed, it kind of worked. I persevered and
learnt the lingo, people there were happy

62
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,430
to chat about the things being discussed or
anything related to DEV environment, when

63
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,400
you feel you have to say the right thing to
fit in and at any time someone will find

64
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,139
out you don't know all the things, you start
sticking to the one thing that gets you through

65
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:35,510
these meet ups and I liked games, playing
games, I liked the idea of making games. One

66
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:40,520
of the groups was putting on a Gamejam in
a month or so and I thought oh wow, I can

67
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:48,830
do some actually programming here, I looked
at code on slides before at meet ups it was

68
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,570
easy, definitely wrong, what they don't show
in the code slides is the other 100 that make

69
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:02,870
those work, I went to Google game tutorials
to learning programming and discovered Python,

70
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:15,080
one caught my eye, rogue like library, the
5 hour tutorial took 17, I had functioning

71
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:21,180
game, it was really cool, it was the first
time I made something from scratch.

72
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,990
When I went to the Gamejam, somebody asked
if anybody wanted to do Python, I was like,

73
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:36,860
yes, this is fantastic, I don't need to go
a rogue like on my own, I latched on to the

74
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,899
people doing Python and didn't let go.

75
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,779
Then there was a team, a team of people who
knew that I had literally never done anything

76
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,180
until the weekend before and were able to
skeleton out the game and let me play with

77
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,029
random variables and see, you know, how to
implement proper looking gravity and stuff

78
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,740
like that. Like I even, I was quite proud,
I implemented a Para. lacks scrolling library

79
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,759
for a platformer when my team mates set we
don't have time for that, 20 minutes later

80
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,790
it was done, I was King of the world.

81
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:17,220
It was there that I met somebody who did Java
as work, I said hey I'm learning Java, I should

82
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:24,029
ask them what it's like to be a junior developer,
he came in at that same kind of place and

83
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:31,720
gone through they're process, on job adverts,
looking for a junior developer, three years

84
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:39,970
experience programming in eight different
languages is like, what!! Like, seriously!?

85
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:46,850
Catch 22, junior developer, three years' experience,
either they not junior or they are not training

86
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,699
the people in three years the right thing
and you should just not be doing that. So

87
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:57,980
the company you work for hired developer via
QA, you would spend a couple of years in the

88
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:05,740
QA department, moving from manually to automated
testing, then in DEV team testing, essentially

89
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,610
when you get familiar enough with integration
tests, you write unit tests and then code

90
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,779
to go with them, it seemed like a better job
than forklift driving, air conditioned office,

91
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:25,809
free water, what could go wrong! \{Laughter\}
So I sent a CV away, heard nothing. Got in

92
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:30,819
touch with my friend who said they couldn't
find my CV, I thought ok I'll try again, tried

93
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:37,410
again, I took a note that an error assisted,
at the same time as there was an error processing

94
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:46,589
your application, congratulations CV submitted
successfully, I thought that might be weird.

95
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,550
My friend got in touch after a few weeks and
said they still didn’t have any record of

96
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:56,879
it, I sent an email with screen shots to reproduce
the bug that I'd found, as it turns out that

97
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:07,490
was a pretty good higher for QA, it did that
for a while but soon got very, very bored

98
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:14,660
to make sure the flow works on a different
build, but I lived in the town where all the

99
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,009
meet ups were, so I was able to leave work
and go to the meet up without rushing, Python,

100
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:28,379
bit of Ruby, video games, but I really, really
liked one of them, the JavaScript group, I

101
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,569
loved how the language looked \{Applause\}.

102
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:42,350
Great. There is an excuse. I loved how the
language looked and I saw Ashley's talk describing

103
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,410
iteration through an array. If you look at
Ruby when you already know what iteration

104
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,910
is, it looks really nice, when you look at
JavaScript it actually explains what it's

105
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,019
doing, it's great. There's still like semicolon
and I would reference a function it wouldn't

106
00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:00,179
call I wouldn't know why because it was there
was no brackets on the end. So yeah.

107
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:10,579
At the time I got into JavaScript round February
last year having been programming for 2 or

108
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:16,970
3 months at various meet ups every month or
so I would do anew thing. So this was well

109
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,079
into node being a thing, IE 11 had been out
for a few months I’m like a clean slate

110
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,819
for somebody presenting JavaScript as if for
the first time. They have played JavaScript

111
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:30,790
image in the past they tell you what do you
like in programming you say JavaScript they

112
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:39,300
go oh I am sorry. Come on you're programming
you can open the DevTools and do this. JavaScript

113
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,920
was power, power over something that I just
loved which was the web, you could take any

114
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,100
website and ruin it in the DevTools, break
everything because you completely didn't understand

115
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,889
what was happening but you knew 4 functions
if you applied them in the right way you could

116
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:56,220
break everything, it was fantastic.

117
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,999
It felt like you could just type vaguely what
you wanted to happen and it worked. I mean

118
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:04,739
I was doing simple stuff but it was amazing
how quickly you can go from hey there's this

119
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:11,100
thing from JavaScript to enough power, enough
knowledge to be dangerous. I really liked

120
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,259
the Jennifer quote from the intro on Friday
which is JavaScript is pseudocode with semi-colones

121
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:25,399
on the end. I get that. It was just under
9 months or about 8 months that after I started

122
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,059
doing manual testing that we had. I had gone
to ScotlandJS seen some fantastic, started

123
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:36,410
giving talks at user groups about things I
didn't know anything about, but an opening

124
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:42,819
in the UX team who were working on their first
AngularJS application having being doing Java

125
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:49,350
rendered pages for end tyre company's laugh,
I think I said JavaScript often enough in

126
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,420
the interview they were like yeah we'll take
you on. I got the job.

127
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,610
So there's a team of hackers we're all doing
JavaScript it's all so fun. I get the title

128
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,769
of the talk I may have mislead you I didn't
want to come here just to tell you my story,

129
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:09,249
because now I am a developer that's where
the story ends but I want to tell you about

130
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:13,799
some of things that helped me along some,
I learned myself some that others taught and

131
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:19,189
definitely some that I wish somebody had said
sooner. This talk is for you if you no anybody

132
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:23,999
starting on the path to becoming a developer
whether that's you useful, yourself, a colleague,

133
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,009
somebody who's interested they don't know
how to deal with that. Or even if you are

134
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:33,360
watching this thing that's me I want to move
into development I came here to learn and

135
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,879
be interested.

136
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:42,009
Firstly, I would just say that this is not
the right way to teach people modern web development.

137
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:47,399
I realise you can't see, oh no it's actually
contrast quite well you cannot read it, it’s

138
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,290
entirely deliberately it's the stack from
ThoughtWorks training course the JavaScript

139
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,389
toolkit which is great for experienced developers
who want to know what tools they have available

140
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:05,110
across everything, but when you're new, you
feel like all the things? I have to

141
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,970
learn all of that before I can write a website?
This is useless. I think it's important we

142
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,610
should make learning materials at whatever
level as accessible as you possibly can so

143
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,299
we can take people from this to this and be
excited about learning the things they need

144
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:25,749
to learn. Let's go through some of things
you could and should know about what I value

145
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:28,119
as a new developer.

146
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:34,100
First one, honesty. It always nice. Because
when you start out you break something you

147
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,439
hit an error, you feel like you're the only
one that's having this problem and having

148
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:44,079
it because you're stupid and you don't know
anything. You can't figure out the right key

149
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,799
word to search for, you can't ask somebody
because that would be terrible they will fire

150
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:53,399
you because oh my God you have caused an error
it's broken something on your computer. That's

151
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,209
terrible. You feel like failures, what they
don't realise it's that everybody programming

152
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:02,549
all the time breaks everything we just get
better at fixing it. Right?

153
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:06,549
So when you have got a junior developer that's
having a tough time with some new syntax or

154
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:12,149
trying to go into ES6 or something, support
them but try and let them come across the

155
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:19,619
answer themselves. If you write the code for
them, you're just writing abracadabra, we

156
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:29,389
have an app. It doesn't work no-one learns
anything, people just as lost as me with things

157
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:37,559
that I had come across helped a lot. It felt
less like I was coding in a bubble, the thing

158
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,949
I did know started becoming relevant.

159
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:50,249
So if open source this next GIF perfectly
encapsulate what I felt I will just look at

160
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:56,299
that repository that looks like an interesting
project. It turns out that there's a lot of

161
00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:00,799
open source software at there, not all of
them are great learning experience but there's

162
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,480
a lot to learn from the community surrounding
some of them are amazing I want to take a

163
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,880
moment to highlight Hoodie that was my introduction
last February my first commit an open source

164
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,980
project if you do know anybody who's does
want to get involved in the community tar

165
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,010
some other awesome initiatives out there to
help newcomers the Rails Girls project, very

166
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:29,139
recently they finished their Summer of Code
where they crowdfunded a large basically trying

167
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:35,899
to pay people who wanted to get into development
and take them under the wing of an open source

168
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:39,600
project, who was happy to mentor them and
answer any questions. It's fantastic. Their

169
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,549
statistics are incredible, I urge anybody
who wants to help to look to them as a real

170
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:48,870
shining example of how to run an initiative
like that but back to my thoughts on things

171
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,380
and stuff.

172
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,610
Source control, I am not going to go too deep
on what source control is if you're not using

173
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:02,200
it my now you should be you know that's fine,
we're here all good, but as far as a new developer,

174
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,669
they may have never used it. I remember my
friend telling me during a team project at

175
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:14,000
his masters university, that will remain nameless
he asked his professor, what happens if 2

176
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,870
people edit the same file, how do we fix that,
is there a nice way of doing it, and he was

177
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:28,500
told that the project manager should make
sure that doesn't happen. \{laughter\} which

178
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:35,090
works, bit cheap though because you have the
opportunity to take someone through source

179
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:42,549
control for the first time, we have been using
it for decades now, as long is I have been

180
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:43,559
alive. New people

181
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,389
don't necessarily have the mental models of
what happens when you do a Git ad they get

182
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:57,590
push, they may any some help with what might
seem like simple or chore Git tasks. I discovered

183
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,830
when you are doing an open source project
you branch you do the Github thing you do

184
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,840
branch commit, then open a pull request but
because you can do a tremendous amount through

185
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,019
the Github UI you never get exposed to the
commands going on. I have been quite taken

186
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:18,909
for using a graphical client for when multiple
people are working on it, if you know someone

187
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,820
who's struggling with Git, explaining the
principles rather than saying these are the

188
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,630
commands you need to run is probably well
worth your time.

189
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,039
This is one of the things that people are
all levels tell everyone, whether it's a firm

190
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,649
or object orientated programmer trying to
get some programming or front end it always

191
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:45,950
helps to see alternative ways of doing this.
Innumerable talks suggesting you write a list

192
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:53,110
to get under the skin of a functional programming
works. The limit on what you can learn by

193
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:59,110
trying new things out doesn't exist, but I
think it's important to remember when you

194
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,130
are new don't dive too deep. You will wind
up with a load of breadth of knowledge in

195
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:08,139
every which way of doing a single thing but
because you have never taken the step forward

196
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:15,480
and tried to do more you end up having a coloured
few on what some languages can and can't do.

197
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,750
Keep in mind the next 2 points. They say even
in my very young career I have heard a lot

198
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,820
premature optimisation is the root of all
evil. I suggest that goes triply so for you

199
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,049
software development education. Don't worry
about how quickly you are learning slow down

200
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:35,850
the relax about, it I know coming to conferences
trying to keep up with all the new technologies

201
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:41,289
and webapps out there means you feel like
you have got to go fast, but honestly learn

202
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:45,950
apt your own pace it's super easy to get burned
out on learning and not really enjoy what

203
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,110
you are doing because you are continuously
thinking about all the things you don't know.

204
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,320
I say find your niche, because frankly the
stack doesn't matter here we're at JSConf

205
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,220
we properly have JavaScript in our stack at
some point that not necessarily the best fit

206
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:06,809
for everybody. So what you want to find out
it's at what level you want to work. With

207
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:10,509
you trying everything you might stumble across
something that really clicks for you. For

208
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:14,360
me it was the web for you it might be systems
programming you might really, really love

209
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,970
concurrent thread port server, I don't know
the words I know they exist I just shove them

210
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:25,480
into a sentence, sometimes people say oh yeah
I get what you mean. I have also heard that

211
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,789
in systems programming everything has to be
web scale. Is that a thing? I don't know,

212
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:36,190
but yeah. Find your niche and explore more
the worse thing that will happen is that you

213
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:42,009
learn more about something and learn that
you don't really care for it that much and

214
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,399
that's fine.

215
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:48,429
That's minimum viable product idea that goes
round take the minimum shippable thing because

216
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:54,100
shipping culture it has his own problems but
that's for another talk. We should really

217
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,850
get into habit of teaching new developers
they should get it working force, then focus

218
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,820
on making it better because if they apply
the same principles and it doesn't work, they

219
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,100
have no idea why. Just for those of you in
the back that is a pile of sand being held

220
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:12,850
down by a 3 inch or 4 inch wide strap which
looks like it might work, probably

221
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,690
won't. I have lost count of how many times
I have made a start trying to solve something,

222
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,960
then second guess myself because some inconsequential
implementation detail was not perfect them

223
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,370
then I was completely sidetracked from my
train of thought. If I could get offer this

224
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:35,210
my Github profile would get a lot busier,
but the number one thing that led me here

225
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,210
to talk you all whether that's people in your
local dev community, helpful people who answer

226
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:45,990
questions on Twitter, people in open source
communities people in slack RIRC, everyone

227
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,399
and people were the number one thing that
inspired me to join this web community. We

228
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:55,909
need to start considering interpersonal skills
as a major part of levelling up as a junior

229
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:58,000
dev.

230
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,779
We need to remain accountable for our action's
programming is not the preserve of the super

231
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:06,429
educated anymore you have access to computers
that fill entire rooms and can take a punch

232
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:13,700
card and spit out some binary, but we have
moved past that. Anybody with a computer of

233
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,649
any kind, anybody who picks up a Firefox OS
phone or 30 bucks or whatever can try out

234
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:23,590
web programming they can make an app in I
think the current record upstairs was something

235
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,659
like of seconds. They have an app it's there,
they can use it, they can interact with it

236
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:36,389
they can learn from it immediately, that's
fantastic, but the problem with people is

237
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:41,149
that they are haters out there. If you go
down stack overflow and say hey I am having

238
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:45,880
a bit of trouble adding these 2 number again
what should I do the first answer is, use

239
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:52,250
a jQuery plug-in, no please don't do that.
You need to be encouraging, giving them things

240
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:58,409
to do that are would help them understand
because otherwise, certain websites look like

241
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:03,000
this. You ask a question, and immediately
everybody leaps down your throat oh my God

242
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,830
you are using angular 1.2 you terrible human
being. I always like to think it's GIFs because

243
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:16,080
I like animation, but do you know who deserves
to learn from you and who you can learn from?

244
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,360
Literally everyone. Thanks Gary.

245
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:27,269
So, in short, one year and 26 days ago today,
I began my new life as a software developer,

246
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:33,179
about 7 weeks ago I moved to Berlin and changed
job and I am now a junior front-end dev, I

247
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:38,990
am very happy. Because I am standing up here
hopefully I can help at least one more person

248
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:48,860
gain the confidence to get involved too. So
thank you very much I have been Louis Cowper.

249
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,970
\{applause\}

250
00:24:49,970 --> 00:25:01,059
Actually, is that timer right? If I have got
5 minutes, I have got 3 minutes here. Just

251
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:06,440
a quick thing I have got a few minutes, I
want to just take a moment to talk about something

252
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:15,580
that I have been working really hard on, oh
that's not mirroring. That will work. Yeah

253
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:23,200
so let's look at Hoodie, and Hoodie CSSI have
been working on a tool that takes a Markdown

254
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,990
trial and pretty prints it with chalk it's
not really fully done and code blocks don't

255
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:35,750
look too good. What I have in package JSON
is MPM run help I would thoroughly urge anybody

256
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:44,600
using MPM as a build tool to try that when
you run PMP run as normal you just get a list

257
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,159
of the script that can be really be helpful
if you already know what all the dependencies

258
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,059
do but I just want to promote, oh I am off
the bottom, sorry.

259
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:55,590
When you run MPM as normal you just get a
list of the scripts, it can be really helpful

260
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,429
if you already know what all the dependencies
do, but I just want to promote I'm off the

261
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:05,720
bottom, ok, sorry, MPM run, help, input file
which I hold ooh... what happened there? That

262
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:13,389
was fantastic! Still working on it, great,
hold on. Come on, stop, there we go, no! No!

263
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:20,639
Don't ask me! ! Basically we have the marked
down file we can keep in sync, it looks great

264
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:29,059
in Github, take the input of run and add comments,
tell people why you are doing what you are

265
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:35,000
doing, it hopefully will take off and everybody
will really like it, it will help you go from
