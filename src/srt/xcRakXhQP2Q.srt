00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,510

alright so hi everybody my name is Kate

2
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,910
Hudson I'm a web engineer and I work on

3
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,200
web maker at the Mozilla Foundation I'm

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,050
super way more comfortable writing node

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,940
and JavaScript than I am speaking to

6
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,840
humans so you'll have to bear with me

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,560
today I'm going to talk to you about

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,329
diversity and I'm going to talk to you

9
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,940
about contributors and most of you don't

10
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,860
need convincing that this is a really

11
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,360
important topic and we need to talk

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,550
about it an open source but when it

13
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,260
comes to finding solutions and

14
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,750
practically implementing them which is

15
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,100
what I'd like to address by the end of

16
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,200
my talk I think it's worth clarifying

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,470
exactly what that means so what do we

18
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,140
mean by diversity and why is diversity

19
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,210
so important particularly to open source

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,430
so typically when we discuss diversity

21
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,479
we're talking about how we identify

22
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,990
ourselves and how other people identify

23
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,960
us so you know those can be qualities

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,170
like gender ethnicity our belief systems

25
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,979
are shape or color most of discussion

26
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,600
around diversity of identity and

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,250
centered around things like power

28
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,490
structures politics equity rights and

29
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,939
communication but identity really

30
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,860
matters but it's not the only form of

31
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,170
diversity it's also important to

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,970
recognize the existence of cognitive

33
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,070
diversity and that is the differences in

34
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,409
terms of how we think and the experience

35
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,090
and training that led us to think that

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,840
way so as a society we're really

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,689
interested in cognitive qualities that

38
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,969
lead to creativity innovation higher

39
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,950
performance that relate to individuals

40
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,870
but we're actually not talking so much

41
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,459
about how being different can

42
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,459
collectively lead to better outcomes so

43
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,690
that's why I wanted to share some

44
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,300
research that I read pretty recently

45
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,250
it's a book called the difference it was

46
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,870
written by a really awesome guy named

47
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,330
Scott page and the central premise of

48
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,400
his research is that diversity Trump's

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,319
ability when it comes to creating great

50
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,019
outcomes so the first thing he does is

51
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:41,380
defined what cognitive diversity is I'm

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,910
not going to read this whole slide you

53
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,440
can go and find the book if you want

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,330
more information but essentially it's a

55
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,980
difference in terms of our perspectives

56
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,500
and how we use those to construct

57
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,209
different models and predictions and

58
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,400
methods for finding solutions so that's

59
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,489
cognitive diversity he looked at problem

60
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:00,010
solving capabilities of high-performing

61
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,660
but homogeneous groups of thinkers

62
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,140
compared to less experienced but very

63
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,120
diverse thinkers and he found pretty

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,040
conclusively that for certain kinds of

65
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,739
problem-solving diverse groups performed

66
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:14,920
much better so this wasn't true for all

67
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,200
tasks routine tasks like flipping

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,810
burgers and mechanical things virtually

69
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,569
no benefit for tasa had to be performed

70
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,910
in isolation by individuals like some of

71
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,190
the early software development work

72
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,500
better for individuals with experience

73
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,010
but the most benefit beneficial was

74
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,620
disjunctive tasks so group performance

75
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,810
being disproportionately dependent on

76
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,670
the strongest member in different cases

77
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,340
and that's really interesting because

78
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,290
modern software development is to a

79
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,750
large extent disjunctive so for any

80
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,870
particular problem and set of problems

81
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,220
there's different cognitive abilities

82
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,389
that will solve particular problems

83
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,389
better in open source solutions rise to

84
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:58,139
the top without being blocked by other

85
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,760
processes and it allows for outliers to

86
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,040
rise when they're needed which is pretty

87
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,970
cool so yeah diversity of experience

88
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,739
matters to open source it's a perfect

89
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:11,880
problem for diversity and that's awesome

90
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,319
so now you guys have a pretty robust

91
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,660
understanding of what diversity is and

92
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,320
why it matters let's talk implementation

93
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,729
so I'm going to show you some things you

94
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,229
can do when you go back to your jobs

95
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,090
that will help attract more contributors

96
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,090
and more importantly maximize the value

97
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,720
you get

98
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,050
from those contributors so let's start

99
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,700
with code contributors it's something we

100
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,730
know so cognitive diversity is really

101
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,110
important for good engineering we

102
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,940
learned that already because it's

103
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,120
largely a distant disjunctive process

104
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,280
and it's really important remember that

105
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,020
individuals who may not have the same

106
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,590
domain experience will actually come up

107
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,970
with better solutions to certain

108
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,010
problems that's not true of all problems

109
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,690
it's not probably going to be true for

110
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,540
like re-architecting some of your app

111
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,100
but it's going to be interesting for

112
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,780
like new problems that nobody knows how

113
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,300
to solve so how do we support different

114
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,950
areas of expertise without slowing

115
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,470
contributors down and ourselves as core

116
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,660
contributors one of the best ways is to

117
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,690
make reducing dependencies on domain

118
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,230
knowledge and project history so one way

119
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,880
you can do that is by splitting your

120
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,680
codebase into modules so if you have

121
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,840
like a huge legacy code base and it's

122
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,580
impossible to fix all the docs at once

123
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,150
consider releasing part of it as modules

124
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,650
so one things we did on the web maker

125
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,570
project is we decide to take all of our

126
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,660
style and CSS put it on a bootstrap API

127
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,060
and release it as a separate module so

128
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,620
that contributors who are interested in

129
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,160
contributing to just like our UI and our

130
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,960
style could actually hack on that

131
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,780
without setting up our crazy stack with

132
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,550
Redis and mongodb and all that stuff so

133
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,590
another consequence of cognitive

134
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,630
diversity is that communicating and

135
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,190
decision-making becomes way more

136
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,680
difficult you already know this because

137
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,390
there's already a huge diversity of

138
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,850
opinions in your open source projects

139
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,680
and you have to be really really mindful

140
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,710
about how that affects newcomers I can't

141
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,040
tell you how to be an expert in dealing

142
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,620
with conflict if you miss Jen's talk a

143
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,660
couple of days ago on emotional safety I

144
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,140
highly recommend you check it out

145
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,520
another thing you can do is consider a

146
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,700
code of conduct so code of contacts have

147
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,160
been in use for a while especially with

148
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,590
events in the event space what they do

149
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,720
is they help resolve conflicts they make

150
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,140
people feel safe and they're coming into

151
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,050
their space of code contribution to you

152
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,599
so one example of this is Mozilla house

153
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,390
community

154
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,280
patient guidelines they're pretty broad

155
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,140
they cover all kinds of contribution

156
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,820
they're really good guidelines for

157
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,740
dealing with new members you can take a

158
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,590
look at that but another project that I

159
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,300
recently came across that we're trying

160
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,090
to incorporate into our code base is the

161
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,250
contributor code of conduct which is

162
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,470
something that is intended to be a

163
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,020
closer to your files on github so

164
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,990
something alongside contributor md and

165
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,670
it talks about specific behaviors and

166
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,650
github issues and dealing with code

167
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,380
contribution specifically so there's a

168
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,340
couple of projects that are already

169
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,590
using it angular is one of them if you

170
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,420
want to check it out for kit contribute

171
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,100
definitely take a look at that link okay

172
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,170
let's get some water all right so code

173
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,010
contribution is awesome and so now we

174
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,290
know how to equip our code for a better

175
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,180
place for newcomers but I think it's

176
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,830
also critical that we expand our

177
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,810
definition of contributor and this is

178
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,820
really what I want to talk about the

179
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,470
most is taking advantage of the full

180
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,210
range of human talent that's available

181
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,810
to us so like that's pretty stupid right

182
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,860
I mean assuming that the only part of

183
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,420
our what we're working on can improve

184
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,880
from collaborative iteration is code is

185
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,340
completely ludicrous even if you're

186
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,870
writing a library that's like really

187
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,840
technical I think what you're doing can

188
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,790
definitely benefit from contributors

189
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,880
that have skills other than your own so

190
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,470
the first thing I want to talk about on

191
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,180
this extremely relevant to software

192
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,920
develop it up development that you can

193
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,500
get contributors is user research how

194
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,410
many people know what user research is

195
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,000
yay sort of lots of people so I'm going

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,680
to talk about specifically a kind of

197
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,410
user research called user testing and

198
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,270
basically what that is is does my

199
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,220
software work the way I expect it to you

200
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,830
and I got to tell you based on what

201
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,140
we've done with user research it often

202
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,010
doesn't so again the idea here is to

203
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,080
rely on people who have more expertise

204
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,640
and access to communities that are

205
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,040
valuable to you to do the user testing

206
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,410
for you what you have to do first is to

207
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,120
write tasks that are relevant to your

208
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,680
project so that they can actually hold

209
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,100
user testing so how does that look look

210
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,920
kind of looks like testing but not you

211
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,930
kind of write down some expectations

212
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,430
about new features that are landing or

213
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,529
problems you're seeing you do the

214
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:05,149
implementation and then you run user

215
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:06,949
testing or get your contributors to do

216
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:09,019
it to see if your expectations were

217
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:13,399
right these are some examples of what

218
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,500
tests look like so there's user stories

219
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,709
scenarios where you have users pretend

220
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,199
they're doing something and expectations

221
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:22,639
like what will happen when you click on

222
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,430
something I think expectations are

223
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,170
particularly relevant to library

224
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,630
developers in the case of error states

225
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,790
so even if you're not doing like front

226
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,310
facing you I you can run user testing on

227
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,980
developers to see if you know when they

228
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,329
get an error state are they

229
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,430
understanding what the air is like those

230
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,870
are some examples of what you could use

231
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,149
if you were testing Bauer about you know

232
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,920
you could run the error have the user

233
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,440
complete some actions and ask them what

234
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,259
they think happened did they actually

235
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:52,699
understand what the error was saying and

236
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:54,079
that would be really cool for new

237
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:57,019
contributors to try doing do things fail

238
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:00,019
in the way you expect them to so some

239
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,569
tips help contributors choose the right

240
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,639
target audience it's really awesome to

241
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,500
take advantage of contributors different

242
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,029
communities that you may not have access

243
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:10,130
to but it's also really important to say

244
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,930
which users are not relevant like you

245
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,189
wouldn't want to go to a group of

246
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:15,259
kindergartners and test our error

247
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,720
messages like that would not be that

248
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,819
helpful on the other thing is you only

249
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,350
need around five sessions to make it

250
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,620
really valuable so yeah I mean you don't

251
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,959
have to expect your contributors to do

252
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,519
thousands of surveys or anything like

253
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,610
that we found that user testing done by

254
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,139
community provided different

255
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,209
interpretations and areas of focus even

256
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,670
with the same test than our core team so

257
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,199
I think it's really cool because it's in

258
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:40,550
the spirit of taking advantage of

259
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,769
cognitive diversity and finding out what

260
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:50,110
people care about okay so next I'm sorry

261
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,350
alright so the next thing is

262
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,439
localization so I actually tried to

263
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:58,610
figure out how to pronounce that word

264
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,130
and German to make it really you know

265
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,889
awesome but I know so if anybody speaks

266
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,630
German you should teach me how to say

267
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,120
that after so to demonstrate this

268
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,720
principle

269
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,790
I'm going to look at a contributor

270
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,370
pathway that we've actually had a lot of

271
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,860
successful work with my team and that's

272
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,350
localization how many people know what

273
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,439
localization is a lot of people okay how

274
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:24,139
many people actually have implemented

275
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,810
localization in their project and how

276
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,740
many people feel like they're doing it

277
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,600
really successfully yeah it's it's a

278
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,720
hard problem so that's why I want to

279
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,790
talk about it I feel like so

280
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,170
localization for those of you who don't

281
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,870
know what it is it's making your project

282
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,250
or your product available in different

283
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,009
languages or locales and much deeper

284
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,680
than that it's making your software

285
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,779
available that in a way that's

286
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,910
culturally meaningful or changing your

287
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,040
UI to make it more relevant for

288
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,439
particular cultures so I'm going to talk

289
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,629
about a specific process that we did

290
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,790
localization that made it honestly like

291
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,980
really easy for us to localize all of

292
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,569
our materials and it was an extremely

293
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:10,610
valuable process for us so the first

294
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,069
thing you have to do is we were looking

295
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:14,269
we started by looking at the accept

296
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,100
language header which is something that

297
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,740
all browsers send with requests to your

298
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,930
application and that helps you guess

299
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,000
like what the browser settings are it's

300
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,399
not perfect but it's a good start for

301
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,290
example in client-side applications

302
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,269
there's burying implementations of

303
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:31,699
navigator dot language so you may have

304
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,800
to rely on other things to determine

305
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,139
language the next thing you have to do

306
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,120
is have some kind of user can control

307
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,089
over what language for example we have

308
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:43,040
like the locale as part of our routing

309
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,709
i'm having some UI for users to choose

310
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,779
what languages honestly not that hard

311
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,079
just a way to detect language the next

312
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:53,300
thing you have to do is figure out a way

313
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,730
to include localization functions in

314
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,740
your templating language whatever that

315
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,459
is so this examples from angular

316
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,540
basically you just have a function that

317
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,240
converts a list of strings like this in

318
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,059
a JSON file that's keyed on some words

319
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:10,819
so hello Jas comp and a function called

320
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:13,040
get tests to get text to replace that

321
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,529
with the locale specific string and it's

322
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,579
like honestly pretty easy and finally

323
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,720
this is the part where you get the

324
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,490
contributors we up

325
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,870
loaded all of our we have like an

326
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,089
automatic system to upload all of our

327
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:28,040
Jason files to transifex which is a

328
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,010
continuous localization platform and it

329
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,110
basically allows users to look at each

330
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,760
string and some notes about it and

331
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,850
translate it into their language on the

332
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,959
interesting thing here is we didn't

333
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,180
actually have to invent this system to

334
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,880
get localizers to work with us we

335
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,770
actually use existing communities and

336
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,050
existing systems we went to them which

337
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,520
was less work for us libraries can be

338
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,260
localized too so just because you don't

339
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,470
have like a full user facing app doesn't

340
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,050
mean you can't localize your material

341
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,600
moment je s which is like a date and

342
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,899
time library uses a strategy to like set

343
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:07,760
language and include localized versions

344
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,950
of date and time so you can also do that

345
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,430
too so the results of this for our

346
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,760
project is that um webmaker in

347
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,500
production is translated into 18

348
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,040
languages in full and it there's 100

349
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,160
over 100 languages and also so that's

350
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,100
our our dashboard and if you see there

351
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,160
we've got a thousand 57 contributors on

352
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,760
a fairly new project that's a thousand

353
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,180
57 contributors that is a non-trivial

354
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,100
amount of people that care about your

355
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,200
project and are actively contributing to

356
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:50,300
it thank you and I have to say seeing

357
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,120
people in different countries with using

358
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,490
our tools and that where our tools are

359
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,950
the only one of that tool in their

360
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,040
language is like an amazing thing to see

361
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,740
so besides it being really valuable for

362
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,350
us to get that translation we also learn

363
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,149
some unique things from going through

364
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:11,350
the localization process this is our

365
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,110
html5 video editor a popcorn maker we

366
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,279
found that when we translated into

367
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,260
Arabic we lies that we had to actually

368
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,690
adjust our CSS and Rui to be on the

369
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,670
right hand side we learned that we had

370
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,230
to deal with variable string length so

371
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,930
we couldn't make fixed elements we went

372
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,540
through a whole process of learning that

373
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,640
we would never have done if we hadn't

374
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,329
have localized our apps so yeah the key

375
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:36,380
inside here is instead

376
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,180
thinking about always having a mentor

377
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,490
and make work for your contributors ask

378
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,560
contributors to teach you like what

379
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,240
they're experts at and bring them in

380
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:52,610
that way okay so these things that i

381
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,850
showed you localization user research

382
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,400
may not be relevant to you the one thing

383
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,560
you can do when you go back to your job

384
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,330
on monday and you're working on your

385
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,640
open source projects is take a list of

386
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,980
possible blind spots that you have on

387
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,090
your project that aren't necessarily

388
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,450
related to code and make specific asks

389
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,460
to communities about how they can help

390
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,470
contribute to your project you know

391
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,690
maybe you need accessibility experts to

392
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,390
help do QA maybe you need copywriters to

393
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,940
help work through your docs maybe you

394
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,000
need more animated gifs I don't know

395
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,590
there's experts in every field take

396
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,890
advantage of them so now you know a

397
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,270
little bit more about what cognitive

398
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,010
diversity is and how you can use it on

399
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,360
when you don't know how to take

400
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,890
advantage of certain things in your code

401
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,110
base but if there's one thing that I

402
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,970
want you to take away from this talk it

403
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,490
would be this making good software is

404
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,190
really hard and it's going to be

405
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,890
even Yeah right it's it's really hard

406
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,630
and it's going to be even harder for the

407
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,670
open source community to deliver really

408
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,860
great products in the future you know 10

409
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,010
years from now so we can't afford not to

410
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,810
take advantage of this awesome thing

411
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,180
that is cognitive diversity so let's go

412
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,529
make it work thank you
