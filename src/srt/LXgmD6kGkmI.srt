1
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:33,880
Can we just talk about the snack game at JSConf?

2
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,219
It's on point.

3
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,940
Also Malte's dance party that's going on in
the background.

4
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,940
Killing it.

5
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,940
It's amazing.

6
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,120
So I want you all to get pumped right now
because the journey we're going to go on is

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,379
going to blow your minds.

8
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:55,530
So we're going to talk about something that
I've talked about recently which is sequential

9
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,679
art, and SVGs.

10
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:10,900
And so my name is Zahra, and I work at Bustle,
a feminist group which a focuses on inclusivity,

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,670
positivity, and empowerment.

12
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:21,810
What I love working about media is I get to
be a digital storyteller as well as an intellectual.

13
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,110
One of the things that we pride ourselves
on at Bustle is breaking out of the standard

14
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,840
article format.

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,060
For example, one of the storytelling formats
that we've experimented with is this interactive

16
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,020
flowchart.

17
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,030
It's a choose-your-own-adventure that breaks
you out of the monotony of the article, and

18
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:54,900
lets and I think 
the best way to convey something is through

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,560
telling a story whether that's through educating,
or entertaining, or persuading.

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,790
And if you think about it, we tell so many
stories in our lives, whether that's through

21
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:12,000
movies, photographs, or tweets, and what all
of these have in common is that they break

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,010
the story into pieces arranged in a very specific
way where you move sequentially through time.

23
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,580
One of the best known forms of telling stories
in a sequential format that pre-dates the

24
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,260
Internet and the moving image is, of course,
comics.

25
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,710
Eisner uses the term comics.

26
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:49,420
And Scott McCloud gets at this in understanding
comics Scott McCloud says, where taken individually,

27
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:58,310
the pictures on the left are just pictures
but when they become part of a sequence, even

28
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,650
that sequence is only two, the art is of the
image is transformed into the art of comics.

29
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,049
He goes on to define what we talk about when
we talk about comics.

30
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:19,940
He says

31
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,300
comics have been around for a very long time.

32
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,750
In fact, they predate the Internet by centuries.

33
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:41,439
Here's a comic from 32 centuries ago. -- and
think other side of the world, archeologists

34
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:47,920
have found ancient paintings in Mexico created
2700 years later organized similarly.

35
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,909
Even though this isn't a modern comic, what
we're looking at is still a story that goes

36
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:58,480
on a deliberate chronological order where
you start on the left and you go to the top

37
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
right.

38
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,129
There's no panel borders like we're used to,
but there are clear divisions of scene.

39
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:11,500
Now I have no idea when or where the first
comic was created in history but the one mention

40
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,840
that's a huge deal in the history of comics
and sequential art is the invention of printing.

41
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,580
Printing turned the art form that would be
a diversion for the rich and powerful and

42
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,980
allowed it to be enjoyed by anyone.

43
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,820
So given the legacy of comics as a art form,
how has the Internet changed our relationship

44
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,080
to sequential art, and what it it mean for
us to go from print comics to post-print comics

45
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,440
in the digital age.

46
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,880
For us at Bustle, one of the first steps that
we took to comics is an made the story called

47
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:59,570
Sunday Comics, which we produce once a week,
sometimes they were told over a series of

48
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,930
a few weeks, and sometimes they were just
one offs.

49
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:08,220
They were for fun to make, and some fun to
watch.

50
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,220
So we thought how do we take this further.

51
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,450
And bring a similar experience to the web
without making them difficult to produces.

52
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,680
We didn't want to just adopt the shape of
the previous technology of comics that we

53
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,820
were already acquainted with.

54
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:31,600
For example, you could just scan in an article
and say you brought comics to the web.

55
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,650
But to me, that was not very interesting.

56
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:41,800
I wanted to bring a single unbroken reading
line while taking advantage of all the things

57
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,520
that the browser had to offer.

58
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,870
I set out to create stories in the form of
sequential art on an infinitive canvas along

59
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,560
the y-axis.

60
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,470
So this is the comic experience that we had
in its final form.

61
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:08,810
We wanted it to recontextualize the sequential
art while emotionally engaging the audience.

62
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,630
For example, notice that there's this interesting
parallax effect where things that are closer

63
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,400
scroll more quickly than things in the background.

64
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,220
Everything is designed to take advantage of
the beautiful Retina displays.

65
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,750
And when you move your mouse, things move
around with you and you can change your perspective

66
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,440
from within the frame.

67
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,830
It gets the viewer involved and you have to
interact with it to see everything in its

68
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,860
full glory.

69
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,120
Sometimes you even have to move it around
to see the text.

70
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,310
If you're on a laptop or a phone, you can
go to bustle.com/comics right now and check

71
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,730
it out by yourself while I'm going through
this.

72
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,190
So how do we do this?

73
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:58,600
And, of course, the answer is: The solution
to most things on the web.

74
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm just kidding.

75
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,979
There's zero React involved.

76
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,720
[ Laughter ]

77
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,190
It's SVGs.

78
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,190
It's not on brand.

79
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,370
React not on brand.

80
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,370
Okay.

81
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,310
So SVGs are a good tool to have and especially
for storytelling because they're resolution

82
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,380
independent, and so they're sharp on in display
which means you don't have to do any image

83
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,500
replacement for different resolutions.

84
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,840
And, of course, they're easily scalable for
responsive designs, to you don't have to produce

85
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,080
a bunch of different asserts for different
screens and they're super easy to animate,

86
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,220
which makes them the most fun.

87
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,800
The fact that SVG allows us to create these
incredibly rich narratives is mind-blowing.

88
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,930
They're truly one of the coolest things that
you can play around with as a developer.

89
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,280
So how is this built?

90
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,840
The first step was to get the parallax working,
and if you're thinking to yourself, why parallax,

91
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:04,220
first of all, why not, and second of all,
it creates a depth of scene and a sense of

92
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,220
physicality.

93
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:13,510
When police report, why not allow your visitors
to visit your site on their own initiative.

94
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,720
Instead of getting static images, you got
a 3D presentation controlled by your own scrolling.

95
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,960
If given the chance, why not use the opportunity
to tell stories in an engaging and interactive

96
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,660
way?

97
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:33,320
In practice, instead of calculating in parallax
movement in JavaScript, we challenged ourselves

98
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:43,080
to do as much as in CSS as possible, shout
out to CSSConf EU.

99
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:53,100
So activate 3D space in an element that needs
to be given, then enables 3D space for each

100
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
tiled elements.

101
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,560
So you define the height in the perspective
style properties of the parent element and

102
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:06,010
that would lock the perspective to its super
creating a 3D viewport with a fixed origin.

103
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,490
The scrolling speed of the parallax elements
is achieved by applying the translate-z function

104
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,940
to the transform-property of the child element,
come places the elements along the z-axis

105
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,010
by placing them farther away or closer to
the user.

106
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,760
After experimentation, we picked the maximum
distance to be background layer.

107
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,490
The maximum layer sits at that distance and
we evenly distribute the remaining layers

108
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,830
from background to foreground.

109
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,750
And here's what it looks like Illustrator
where there's seven years, and those layers

110
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:49,590
are distributed evenly between the foreground
and the background.

111
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,240
Because we're using perspective to achieve
the parallax movement effect, when we move

112
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,450
things farther along the z-axis, they're narrowly
going to get smaller, but illustrators have

113
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:07,900
already drawn to scale to make this inappropriate,
so we need to do a depth correction so that

114
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,680
it answer to be rendered at its original size.

115
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,370
On the left, we have the scale transform applied
versus on the right there is no scale transform.

116
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,280
The good news is that as things move farther
away, they get smaller at a predictable rate

117
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,940
so we can apply a scale transform to render
it at its original size.

118
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,281
This way we get the parallax effect of moving
things along the z-axis without the size distortion.

119
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:39,260
The advantage of this is we just set a few
CSS properties and the browser takes care

120
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,600
of everything else, and there's very minimal
JavaScript required to set up the comic.

121
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,940
So, again, this is how the scene will look,
with and without depth correction.

122
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,520
So on the right we can see what happens when
we translate things on the z-axis without

123
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,740
applying the scale.

124
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:05,170
And on the right, is the depth correction
with the depth correction with the scale applied.

125
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,790
It also means that we're going to apply a
larger scale factor to compensate.

126
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,800
Now even though this seems like fun and games
and browser support is generally excellent

127
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,670
for SVGs, it's a whole other story when you
apply CSS transforms to them.

128
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,940
This is especially painful when it comes to
animations because scale, position, and rotation,

129
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,700
and skew are so fundamental.

130
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:36,870
When you apply transforms to an element inside
the SVG, their browser bugs and inconsistencies.

131
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,460
This gif is from an excellent article in CSS
Tricks can be which shows how the same animation

132
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,450
looks on different browsers.

133
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:52,530
IE and Opera, don't honor transforms at all
on SVG elements, instead you must assign the

134
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,950
attribute.

135
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,510
We could use tools like animation platform,
but what's the fun in using a third-party

136
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,610
library instead of figuring out how to do
it on your own.

137
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:10,400
So our solution was to explore the SVG where
each element becomes becomes an SVG on its

138
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:17,760
own and this allows us to transform it reliably
across all browsers.

139
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:28,400
This is what the SVG looks like with six layers
making up the scene on the right.

140
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,010
And then on the left, we have that same SVG
with each of those six layers exploded into

141
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,810
their own SVG elements and they're all stacked
on top of each other to make it look like

142
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:42,640
the original.

143
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,670
Another cool thing about these comics is the
movement in them.

144
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,090
As you move your mouse, or your phone, everything
moves with you.

145
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,810
The closer the layer it is to you, the more
it moves, the farther away it is, it moves

146
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,680
less and less, just like in the real world
where things that are farther from us move

147
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,200
farther away.

148
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,220
These were one of the Sacramento that we wanted
to add because we didn't want the designers

149
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,300
to think about how to animate the movement
and just have it done for them automatically

150
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,061
based on the numbers of layers they use.

151
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:17,310
What's good is that the effect gives you a
sense of being in the scene.

152
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,100
And as an anecdote, the designers started
putting things in their illustrations where

153
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,460
you have to interact with it to see what's
going on in the whole story.

154
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,370
So how did we manage to get the page to respond
to the mouse and the gyroscope movements?

155
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:36,150
With the help of our good friend from our
math days, logarithm scale, which is a non-linear

156
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:42,279
scale when there's a large range of quantities,
earthquakes, for example, which is not unlike

157
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,920
shaking your phone, or moving your mouse in
the real world.

158
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,661
So this is how it's like the mouse moving
on a logarithmic scale that we actually used

159
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:55,480
to transform each layer.

160
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:03,339
And then you apply the shift to an event listener
based on device orientation or mouse movement.

161
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:08,900
As a visual example of how log scale works,
as the mouse moves in the center, the layers

162
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,240
move quite a bit but as you get closer to
the edges of the browser, they move less and

163
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,550
less because you don't want things to fly
off the screen, again, just like in an earthquake.

164
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,690
What's also cool is you have to move your
mouse around to see what's in the mirror,

165
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,380
or to see what's in the background behind
in the window on the left.

166
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,220
And an important goal of this project was
to allow our designers to be productive in

167
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,690
the tools they already know.

168
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:44,380
One of the reasons for using SVGs is that
our designers are -- Adobe Illustrator.

169
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,820
One thing we could have done was spend half
a year building an online comics editor but

170
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,370
Adobe's already done for that by making a
graphics editor and our designers already

171
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,600
know how to use them.

172
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,480
And one thing that's cool for me personally
is even though they each have their constraints,

173
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,860
they each have their process for design.

174
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:13,540
Allison Gore starts with a loose plan, figures
out how the panels are set up and relate to

175
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,940
each other, and then moves on the Illustrator
and deconstructs the layers to figure out

176
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,530
how their interaction works.

177
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,620
These are some examples of her work.

178
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,110
It's cool to see the behind-the-scenes.

179
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,190
Austin sometimes draws out his main characters
in paper and then moves in to Illustrator

180
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,330
to draw out the whole scene.

181
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,800
An interesting thing about Austin's work is
he uses a lot of color and I asked him about

182
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,210
it, he says it's because he's from New Orleans
and he group surrounded by beautiful colors.

183
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,580
And since he moved to New York City, he myself
how colorful things are, so he tries to remind

184
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,740
himself of home and work.

185
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:04,200
Allyssa tries to get forms on paper to list
their most iconic moments.

186
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:11,710
And she also draws out the scene and writes
out lots of notes even before drawing the

187
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,320
scene out in Illustrator.

188
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,430
She draws lamps, and says, this is what the
Netflix logo looks like, or this is what my

189
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,660
table should look like.

190
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:26,280
Allyssa also believes that you shouldn't draw
everything out for the audience, and let them

191
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,870
figure out things on your own.

192
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:35,750
She thinks that minimalism goes a long way
when it comes to comics.

193
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,529
Don draws out some parts of the story and
tries to make sense of the story before doing

194
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:46,940
anything else and sometimes ends up working
with the writer to change the story entirely

195
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,850
based on her first impression of not making
any sense.

196
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,590
She tries to figure out the characters' emotions
on details.

197
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:00,740
She also feels like she's playing God when
trying to figure out when the character in

198
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,010
the background, or what does the color look
like, or what the character looks like, or

199
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:11,990
what their hair looks like.

200
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:19,579
Bear likes to draw her characters with different
emotions from different viewpoints whether

201
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,209
she lays things out.

202
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:27,130
It's been very rewarding to work on these
things because for relatively little engineering

203
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,480
work, we can help designers create these experiences
that they've never made before and that our

204
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,950
viewers have never seen before.

205
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:41,770
And I'm personally a huge fan of the meeting
the audience, your designers, and your collaborators,

206
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,320
where they are today.

207
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,740
And so the most important lesson that I want
you to take away from this talk is meet your

208
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,230
users where they are.

209
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,740
I know we all have instincts to rewrite everything
and create all these new tools but it's really,

210
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,230
really important to think about how to leverage
existing tools.

211
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,110
And SVGs are a perfect example of that.

212
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,330
You probably already work with designers.

213
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,929
They already know Illustrator.

214
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,920
What are some ideas that you have that if
you were to get out of SVGs, what would you

215
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
do?

216
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,850
I showed you two examples here with interactive
flowcharts and comics.

217
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,740
Both of these have super simple rules that
designers can follow.

218
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,600
Figure out your layers, export to SVG, done.

219
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,990
It's also to note that setting constraints
is okay.

220
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,940
Some of the designers were definitely a little
hesitant about not having enough control over

221
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,780
the animation, or the depth, or the movement,
or wanting to be able to animate certain things

222
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,160
differently.

223
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,990
But the answer I always gave was the same
as, I'm sure, some of you have given once

224
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,800
or twice, PRs are welcome.

225
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,830
But all joking aside, I think having constraints
and having to work within limits creates more

226
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,210
opportunity for creativity and innovation.

227
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:59,760
The way they're using parallax to enhance
the story in these two examples is mind blowing.

228
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:08,530
And, again, it's been super rewarding being
a part of it.

229
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,670
So the question that I have for all of us
is, what are some things that we can do by

230
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,330
using Illustrator as a development tool almost?

231
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:22,470
Or are there other file formats that people
already can use to harness the power of JavaScript

232
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,470
to enhance, and augment?

233
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,470
Thank you.

234
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,470
[ Applause ]

235
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,470
Where's the party?

236
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,470
Malte to the rescue!

237
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,470
That was awesome.

238
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,470
Mind blown!

239
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,470
That was amazing.

240
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,470
We're going to wait a little bit for a few
minutes, again, to let other people from the

241
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,470
other room to attend the talk from the very
beginning but we have more coming up which

242
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,470
is awesome.

243
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,470
Thank you very much, Zahra, that was amazing.
