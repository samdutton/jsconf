00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,610

i'm christopher joseph i work for the

2
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,380
web platform team in Adobe I work on

3
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,140
open-source frameworks JavaScript and

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,230
CSS talk with being the first and I'm

5
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,970
Guillermo Torres I'm a design manager

6
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,970
for Adobe and I support the web

7
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,400
authoring team so we create tools for

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,770
modern web design and web development

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,809
all right so what is top coat top coat

10
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:45,610
is a CSS library for clean and fast

11
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,150
applications that's it it's just CSS we

12
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,330
are live where we're on github we're

13
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,129
open source and the reason why we're

14
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,080
here is because we wanted to get in with

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,059
the community early we wanted to get to

16
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,739
your input we want you guys to

17
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:01,600
collaborate with us into creating this

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,839
this library we have seen a need for

19
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:05,920
this type of library because mainly

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,020
because we've a lot of the the

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,030
frameworks that we've been using are

22
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,190
mainly designed towards websites

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,010
responsive sites and modern web apps and

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,030
one of the things out that we were

25
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,290
seeing the need is that we needed

26
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:23,670
something for installed applications so

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,610
our knee to started mainly internal from

28
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,340
for edge tools and services so these

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,760
tools and services are are the new way

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,520
that we're trying to create tools for

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,140
products for web designers and web

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,140
developers so instead of the normal WA

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,750
of creating products in which that

34
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,730
there's this monolithic feature-rich

35
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,730
tool we're focusing on creating these

36
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,710
tools that are very lightweight that our

37
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,760
task oriented so we have tools like

38
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,960
reflow which is a tool that is mainly

39
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,540
for for responsive design then we have

40
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,370
brackets which is an open source tool

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,260
it's a lightweight code editor that will

42
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,180
in which we also have code that is

43
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,520
similar and then we have edge inspect

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,660
that is a tool for for previewing on

45
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,310
your mobile devices and this lives

46
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,950
either on a browser or integrated with

47
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,250
our own tools so the underlying thing

48
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,050
for this is that all these tools are

49
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,510
created using web standards so for that

50
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,800
we needed to create a new language

51
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,319
because we really didn't really have a

52
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,849
design language based out of that we

53
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,159
were mainly used to creating tools on

54
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,620
the desktop those feature-rich tools so

55
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,790
one of the things that we set out

56
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,439
that we needed to make is a design

57
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,730
language I was based on web standards

58
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,290
and it was meant not just for the

59
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,930
desktop but to live say in browsers and

60
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,549
mobile and in a lot of a lot of places

61
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,489
additionally we support the phone got

62
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:49,959
community and it's a community that

63
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,159
creates installed mobile apps and one of

64
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,540
the things that we're seeing with a

65
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,239
phony community is that they were there

66
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,310
were a lot of developers that were just

67
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,379
getting started so didn't have access to

68
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:05,139
design resources and then the other side

69
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,439
we had they had the word developer

70
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,370
developers that did have the assign

71
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,799
resources but eventually they felt that

72
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,569
they needed to migrate away from what

73
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,720
standards technology to native mainly

74
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,939
because of the doors this perceived

75
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,409
notion that that it would be more

76
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,409
performant so that sort of was another

77
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:26,290
goal for us is to create a library that

78
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,510
was there was very fast that was

79
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,389
performant and out of all this what we

80
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,129
saw is that the common denominator was

81
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,959
CSS one of the things that we're seeing

82
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,340
with all the different apps and

83
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,540
everything that we're doing is that

84
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,849
everyone had the framework of choice

85
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:42,280
even at Adobe are because we're

86
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,680
following an agile model every to every

87
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,069
product team had had to find their own

88
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,979
framework and it was hard to for for the

89
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:53,019
sign team to come out to the product

90
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,669
team as like saying hey you need to

91
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,500
replace this framework or you need to to

92
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,169
changes in order to for us to keep a

93
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:04,840
constant system a look and feel so when

94
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,639
we got started we started getting the

95
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,169
design foundation and we invited

96
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:09,549
stakeholders from the product management

97
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,620
team and engineering team to get a

98
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,010
visual direction on it and we did some

99
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,959
research over what this design language

100
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,229
would be looking like and Adobe our main

101
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:21,970
principle is always the content is king

102
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,280
we design tools for content creators

103
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,130
which means that it's the it's not the

104
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,050
UI that should be highlighted it should

105
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,050
be the content is being created but for

106
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,630
edge tools and services and for the the

107
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,479
products of top coat is supporting there

108
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,919
was a little twist because we're not

109
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,289
just for desktop it was mainly for these

110
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,450
applications that could live anywhere so

111
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,710
we started looking at about what do the

112
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,990
same language is for for a desktop as

113
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,440
for

114
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,030
sup apps you want something that is more

115
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,240
solid you want something that feels like

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,950
you want to grab it like you want to pay

117
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,080
for it it's a little bit more that the

118
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,710
Marcelli the content is usually fixed or

119
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,900
contained and the UI it usually takes

120
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,870
most of the the space and the U is

121
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,990
usually fixed it looks fixed and in

122
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,290
contrast we have web apps web apps the

123
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,660
the content is more dynamic even the UI

124
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,460
is more dynamic you don't you don't

125
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,620
really see it fixed as much it seems to

126
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,200
be changing quite fast so as the

127
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,060
language and this is different than

128
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,580
websites when websites were looking at

129
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,340
say like very targeted type of

130
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,190
interaction so by now or download or

131
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,920
like for but for applications you still

132
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,170
have to design for very complex

133
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:40,540
workflows so for brackets for instance

134
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,570
we still wanted to to have the content

135
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,330
framed in something that looks solid but

136
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,430
because it was still something that was

137
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,380
based on web standards we didn't really

138
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,740
want to fix the UI as much to the actual

139
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,810
frame additionally we were looking at

140
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,070
what what were the considerations around

141
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,220
mobile and for us typography was ended

142
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,610
up being the most important change

143
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,720
because you have so little space to

144
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,450
actually show you I you need to rely

145
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,870
inherit key and typography to to really

146
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,060
bring the content to light additionally

147
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,330
we were exploring theming one of the

148
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,070
things that we saw is that and when you

149
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,750
go to mobile you have more opportunities

150
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,150
to bring your brand into the UI so one

151
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,200
of the things that would be important

152
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,080
for for top coat is for it for us to be

153
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,010
to make it easily be themed able and CSS

154
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,040
is great for this but in and out in any

155
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,710
way we wanted to create a good system so

156
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,419
it's not just about changing a bunch of

157
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,700
numbers the other part when it comes to

158
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,710
designing for native apps is that you

159
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,320
always have to choose what's the context

160
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,410
I or that you're developing and when it

161
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,030
comes to mobile in particular you're

162
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,010
always quenching okay if I'm going to be

163
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,160
designing for iOS app then I

164
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,280
replay replicating day you I from iOS or

165
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,740
if I'm designing for Android and what am

166
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,300
I replicating so there's one of the

167
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,150
things that we found is that it wasn't

168
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,910
really even a wild goose chase there was

169
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,710
no they were there when it can't when it

170
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,450
came to replicating a specific language

171
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,750
so what our goal was for top goes to be

172
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,970
a good OS citizen what this meant for us

173
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,520
that we're designing for lightweight

174
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,820
small abs and those apps were meant to

175
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,580
be working all together with a set of

176
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,860
ABS that a door from the US or third

177
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,540
party or whatever and what we wanted to

178
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,590
keep it is a non jar and user experience

179
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,600
as so as you switch from different

180
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,000
action or having to relearn specific

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,950
language we wanted to find a common

182
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,070
thread across all OS was so we're

183
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,960
starting looking at what were the trends

184
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,850
that the big players in the industry

185
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,610
were taking and a big one was Microsoft

186
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,700
that was very excited about metro UI now

187
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,940
known as a modern UI I was really

188
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,290
excited about the flat looking for you

189
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,650
on the use of typography and in the same

190
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,900
way on the web design track you will see

191
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,480
all this talk about flat UI and one of

192
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,890
the things that I started finding out

193
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,860
with particularly with Microsoft is that

194
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,530
once you got deeper and deeper into the

195
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,300
experience once you got into more of the

196
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,160
professional tools that's when the

197
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,110
experience started to sort of fall apart

198
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,240
it wasn't like really as useful and the

199
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,870
the thing is that it's is that for flat

200
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,930
UI and this type of language there needs

201
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,690
to be a lot of design considerations

202
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,210
because you're left with saying more

203
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,380
with less so there needs to be a really

204
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,969
good designers on it and the other part

205
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,440
is that the language still pretty new so

206
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,330
it hasn't really involved hasn't really

207
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,310
the metaphors hasn't really been set a

208
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,320
big culprit of this was actually this

209
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,510
screen I stared at the screen a long

210
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,100
time was looking for for a clue fort for

211
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,170
North Star and the main thing is this

212
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,560
this weird-looking toggle oops sorry

213
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,630
that weird-looking toggle that is like

214
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,880
why did why do you have to design that

215
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,110
we toggle end the thing is that if that

216
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,460
that's definitely designed by the

217
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,850
empirical designer because

218
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,500
you actually don't need a toggle button

219
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,269
if you were really going flat you

220
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,800
wouldn't you wouldn't have a toggle

221
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,810
button you use the whole card for for

222
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,870
targeting one enough so my thought was

223
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,779
that this is actually a very important

224
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,730
example for North for for top coat

225
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,009
mainly because we were designing not for

226
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:31,630
designers we're designing for developers

227
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,089
and we need it to empower designers to

228
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,699
make good design decisions and if we if

229
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:40,089
we corner them into a flat UI part where

230
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:41,829
they needed to think more holistically

231
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,600
over like what's the overall interaction

232
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,420
then you would see a lot more fumbling

233
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,220
like this so in terms of going flat you

234
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,720
I would still sort of wanted to follow a

235
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,790
little bit of design language the the we

236
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,759
design an icon set that was still flat

237
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,120
where we're pretty excited about icon

238
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,399
fonts a semantic icon fonts so we still

239
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,319
wanted to follow that and Adobe also

240
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:08,949
created its first open source font this

241
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:10,959
source sands and one of the things that

242
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,970
was very important for us that's still

243
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,209
it's very clear you can tell the one

244
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,430
from the from the capital I and from dl

245
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,290
from the eye so it's still following

246
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,519
that sense of clearness additionally

247
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,939
there's what Apple was doing and I'm

248
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:31,720
actually very tired of the other

249
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,399
conversation around humor prism I think

250
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,589
that it's been the culprit of a lot of

251
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:38,110
talks but what I really wanted about to

252
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,720
bring from Apple's humor film is the

253
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,899
sense of humanity like the the notion

254
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:46,300
that there's buttons that want to be

255
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,160
pushed I wanted to move away from this

256
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,459
realism but what we still wanted to

257
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,170
convey some humanity was still something

258
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,970
that was made by humans and finally one

259
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,110
of the things I was very important for

260
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,300
top coat is that we wanted to accelerate

261
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,060
design but in dev terms for us the CSS

262
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,000
is very exciting and actually being here

263
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,430
is great because its CSS had become this

264
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,769
sort of dialogue between designers and

265
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:14,529
developers where there's on the under

266
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,060
one hand you get designers that even

267
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,639
designers that that know how to work on

268
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,220
CSS and do a lot of CSS then they

269
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,860
provide the CSS but they are still shy

270
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,170
too shy to really do pull requests and

271
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,680
get into the

272
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,760
code because they're afraid of breaking

273
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,500
stuff and on the other hand you have

274
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,800
developers that ccss more of sort of

275
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,190
like a declarative and and just adding

276
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,570
here and there and which makes a force

277
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,740
for sloppy writing so so what we really

278
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,450
wanted to do a sort of empower

279
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,209
developers to create the best with a

280
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:48,399
design with it with a good design base

281
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,380
so they can add on top of that when once

282
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,860
they have a designer so we what we ended

283
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,320
up doing was just allocate in the style

284
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,779
kit is it's all done in CSS but it was

285
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:00,700
all designed in CSS but it's just

286
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,700
suggested CSS at this point what we

287
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,060
ended up doing was just CSS that some

288
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,160
developers may be able to copy and paste

289
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,250
but then that's when we were able to get

290
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,170
Christopher and Christopher will talk to

291
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,810
you about the architecture of top coat

292
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:22,830
Thanks thank you right so we had these

293
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,570
style guides there were HTML CSS but we

294
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,370
mainly use them when i worked on reflow

295
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,529
with to pull colors and some styles from

296
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:33,270
and then we write our own CSS from that

297
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,450
style guide we wanted to start using it

298
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,279
more of component they actually make

299
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,050
components out of it because what i was

300
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,339
seeing in the code base is that someone

301
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:43,900
would actually use a button and they go

302
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,160
i like the button and a copy and paste

303
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,180
it somewhere else and then would change

304
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,380
they copy paste that somewhere else i

305
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,490
would change they all have you know

306
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,490
except variations of their of their name

307
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,740
their class name and it became really

308
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,830
hard to maintain so started thinking

309
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,540
about what it would take to make a

310
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,790
component architecture out of CSS and it

311
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,709
came down to mainly just using the tools

312
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,510
that we used everyday topcoats

313
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,720
architecture is around three things

314
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,810
github so it uses github a lot for

315
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,920
github repos it uses stylus which is you

316
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,450
know the preprocessor that we use it

317
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,800
could have used any preprocessor and

318
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,270
actually I hope to use rework in the

319
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,790
future but it worked really well with

320
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,610
our other our last tool which is grunt

321
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,320
so the grunt is just a build script that

322
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,270
puts it all together and gets you the

323
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,529
end result which is just CSS and that's

324
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,480
what I think is so cool about topco and

325
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,560
while I was so excited to work on is

326
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,029
because it is just CSS to the end of the

327
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:38,920
day to use top code is just as easy as

328
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,460
taking

329
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,380
sheet and linking it to your HTML page

330
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,690
and that's it then you have to put in

331
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,760
your classes and whatnot but it's no

332
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,940
more steps than that it also allows you

333
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,890
to work with any like Guillermo said any

334
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,440
framework of choice we're not making any

335
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,540
presumptions about how you should write

336
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,680
your JavaScript or how you should write

337
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,450
your markup you can use it piecemeal you

338
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:06,320
can use any part that you want so when

339
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,480
we were working on the edge web tools

340
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,190
and services it came really apparent

341
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,130
that people don't care if its native or

342
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,440
not as long as it performs correctly the

343
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,970
only time that they notice that it's not

344
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,900
native is when it doesn't work right

345
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:25,250
when like reflow is all written in HTML

346
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,330
and JavaScript and CSS and it's plenty

347
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,250
fast it works exactly how you'd expect

348
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,650
right so no one actually goes in and

349
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,000
says well you know you should make that

350
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,440
native or it's not native it doesn't

351
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,650
come up because it performs correctly

352
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,820
which brings us to our first focus for

353
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,280
top coat was performance started

354
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,960
thinking about well if performance and

355
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,610
native feel is the most important thing

356
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,150
for our framework or our library how

357
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,260
would you do that how do you actually

358
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,680
get performance metrics from CSS and you

359
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,840
can do a lot of stuff locally you know

360
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,580
you can open up your dev tools you can

361
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,900
poke around you can do audits and that's

362
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,130
great but how do you share that with

363
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,720
other people and how do you actually do

364
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,490
that over time how do you share those

365
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,540
results with people and how do you

366
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,950
actually see if your optimizations are

367
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,450
still working in current you know green

368
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,250
browsers that could change nightly you

369
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,720
could have an optimization change that

370
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,190
actually doesn't work the next day and

371
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,570
actually could impact performance the

372
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,800
next day and you wouldn't know unless

373
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,420
you had something that showed you over

374
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,710
time so when we talk about performances

375
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,300
comes down to just don't take my word

376
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,830
for it they'll take anybody's word for

377
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,360
it you should actually be running tests

378
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,610
all the time and we have a solution for

379
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,040
this which is bench top coat that I oh

380
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,990
it's a part of our continuous

381
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,050
integration we actually run a chrome

382
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,510
telemetry tests against our CSS and

383
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,910
basically what it does is runs

384
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,950
chromeless or chromeless headless Chrome

385
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,170
browser and does a scrolling test and

386
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,910
then takes the results and post it to

387
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,960
our server

388
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,050
so you can graph it and here it is live

389
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,910
and again this is all really early stuff

390
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,010
so we only have a few builds up but we

391
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,180
wanted to show you where we're headed

392
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,470
and so we could get people to give

393
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,710
feedback it gives you some metrics off

394
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,320
the bat but then gives you this baseline

395
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,660
metrics we have a baseline test that we

396
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,730
run our style a baseline component

397
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,440
that's not styled that we run our style

398
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,390
component tests against and you can see

399
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,950
it's getting a little bit faster as we

400
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,170
go along as we learn more and remember

401
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,570
we're taking CSS that hasn't been

402
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,980
optimized at all we're just taking it

403
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,090
straight from a style guide and putting

404
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,430
it in and then running against baselines

405
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,530
and trying to increment only change it

406
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,330
make it faster so that's deterministic

407
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,500
so we can actually point something me

408
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,390
like that was faster not just saying I

409
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,680
don't know something changed it was

410
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,960
better the other one is you can actually

411
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,110
go in and it tells you the mean frame

412
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,570
layout and loads and then if I had

413
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,740
another commitment here I could actually

414
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,970
compared to commits and you could

415
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,670
actually go to a shop you saw a spike in

416
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,360
performance I could actually go to

417
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,610
github and see what change is actually

418
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,040
made and go okay well that sped it up or

419
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,510
that really slowed it down I can make it

420
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:07,610
I can revert that consideration for a

421
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,620
main consideration for top it was also

422
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,470
versioning the our first foray into

423
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,140
using a CSS framework was pretty painful

424
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,160
we put in a framework and then we wanted

425
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,500
to get just a modal dialogue because it

426
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,150
got updated and we had to update the

427
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,339
entire framework and actually broke a

428
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,860
lot of things that we were using so I

429
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,240
started thinking a lot about well what

430
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,460
would it take to be able to fix that

431
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,960
like what would I need to be able to

432
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,870
make that work better and so this is the

433
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,400
configuration file i'm showing like the

434
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,900
dirty back part the underlyings of how

435
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,610
we actually build this so that in this

436
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,250
package.json these are just github repos

437
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,150
and this is a tag so I'm creating a tag

438
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,640
version of the repo if you wanted to

439
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,680
update if we updated button for instance

440
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,480
you could actually just update button or

441
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,300
if you updated everything you could just

442
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,160
you could just update the ones you

443
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,300
wanted so if you're happy with button if

444
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,500
you didn't want to change it even after

445
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,480
you could go back to any version this

446
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,000
also supports nightlies if you want to

447
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,280
to just use the nightly or see what

448
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,570
we're doing at the bleeding edge of top

449
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,130
coat you could remove the version all

450
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,750
together and I'll actually just do a get

451
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,940
shallow clone and pull it down for you

452
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,900
locally so you can see where we're

453
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,720
headed we also wanted to allow for

454
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,230
subsetting and this could be something

455
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,180
as grand as subsetting icons or

456
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,640
subsetting fonts or but what we're

457
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,010
focusing on right now is subsetting

458
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,220
component you probably don't want a huge

459
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,680
stylesheet as top coat grows we're going

460
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,760
to have a bunch of components and a

461
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,810
bunch of patterns you probably don't

462
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,280
want all of them and you're in your

463
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,530
application you may only need a few and

464
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,790
you might actually have replacements for

465
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,440
a couple of the components of your own

466
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,840
so you can specify just the ones that

467
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,520
you want so I could say oh I just want

468
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,560
search input and you could rerun the

469
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,510
build and just get that in your final

470
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,970
CSS output and then for those of you who

471
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,320
don't want to be mucking around in

472
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,480
configuration files we're building this

473
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,250
you know Allah bootstrap customized

474
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,130
download your own build website where

475
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,780
you can select a theme choose the

476
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,860
components that you want and all that's

477
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,750
going to do behind the scenes is edit

478
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,880
that config file so if you wanted to do

479
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,380
it by hand you could do that and then

480
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,560
platform support especially for mobile

481
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,510
we realize that you're trying to get as

482
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,610
fast as you possibly can and as lean of

483
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,590
the CSS as you need and also you

484
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,060
probably don't want to have mozilla

485
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,850
prefixes or IE prefixes on your safari

486
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,600
webkit browser for iOS so what we're

487
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,150
building in is the ability to specify

488
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,500
the platforms that you're targeting and

489
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,570
even go farther and specify the versions

490
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,460
so for instance you know the largest

491
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,340
used versions of Android you could

492
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,840
support both of them and then you could

493
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,260
even add specific hats hacks for those

494
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,440
specific versions of that platform

495
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,500
I started realizing that like I said

496
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,940
people were using trying to make

497
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,399
component oriented CSS in our code bases

498
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:09,200
but they were failing because they were

499
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,429
just copying and pasting and there was

500
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,450
no common subset they were using a lot

501
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,159
of different techniques to do this but

502
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,169
the one I saw most commonly was naming

503
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:20,750
convention and I can't take credit for

504
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,880
the one that we're using for topco this

505
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,200
is actually based off of Nicholas

506
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,850
Gallagher's early work for suit but you

507
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,740
can see what it's doing its name spacing

508
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,720
so you can find it easy and you can

509
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
actually create a theme that has your

510
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,029
own namespace it specifies the component

511
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,230
that you're in and then it breaks it

512
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,250
down into different parts of the

513
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,620
component and also you can have so if

514
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,779
you look at the icon button you can have

515
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,669
a modification of that a different type

516
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:48,139
of icon button the quiet one for

517
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:51,260
instance we're also separating concerns

518
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,179
so this is topcoats mainly concerned

519
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:54,850
about styling but we're also adding in

520
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,750
layout and transitions and whatnot those

521
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,860
are going to be separate classes that

522
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,019
will supply that way you could sub in

523
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:04,549
your own grid system if you wanted to

524
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:06,380
for instance and we'll have something to

525
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,490
get you going but if you wanted to use

526
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,840
some cohesive good system you could just

527
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,889
slap that in as a piecemeal this is

528
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:15,200
another part where we got some feedback

529
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,480
that this is too verbose I totally I

530
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,340
totally hear that and it would be a

531
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,840
really awesome to hear what the

532
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,309
community thinks and get feedback on

533
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:23,480
that kind of stuff like how would you do

534
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,679
it how would you like it to be I'd love

535
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,970
to hear that from people we focused a

536
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,250
lot on resets and this is also from

537
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,639
Nicholas Gallagher's findings but I

538
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,809
think we took it a step farther because

539
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:37,850
we're using these reset components so

540
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,380
this for instance this button is just a

541
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,720
a tag but it doesn't have the blue it's

542
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,429
not underlined right we reset it to look

543
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:46,880
to be a base for a button and we're

544
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,149
using this for our our baseline test so

545
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:53,570
we put 200 of those on a page scroll it

546
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,250
see how fast it is but 200 of our style

547
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,630
versions on the page scroll that and see

548
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,950
how fast that is then we compare them

549
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,899
that way we figure the fast as you can

550
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:01,639
get is this reset button it's actually

551
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:02,899
not going to get any faster than that so

552
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:04,669
we're hoping we can over time get as

553
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:07,539
close to the reset as we can that's our

554
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:10,119
testing ideas

555
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,499
we've considered themes from the

556
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:13,349
beginning it needed to be themed ville

557
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:16,809
we wanted to be able to as kiyama said

558
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:18,309
in the early days when we were working

559
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:21,279
on applications like Photoshop and it

560
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,159
was really hard to theme them the the

561
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,899
designers would have to go in and beg

562
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:27,129
someone to make a change for them or

563
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:28,269
they'd have to like go in and learn how

564
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:30,009
to hack see code and they didn't really

565
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:31,749
want to do that now we have this really

566
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:33,879
amazing work flow where the designer can

567
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:35,289
go in and be like it looks lets you look

568
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:37,749
something like that and then it is a

569
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:39,699
developer goes through in readded sit

570
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:40,929
but now we're going to try and get to

571
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:43,119
the point where you can actually expose

572
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:45,389
the variables that you want to edit and

573
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:47,949
the designer can actually theme make a

574
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,109
theme there's another thing so in here

575
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:52,599
it's another yet another github repo its

576
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:55,389
top theme and this is just a collection

577
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:59,319
of variables and mix-ins that you can

578
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,019
use to make your own theme you could

579
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:03,369
actually just go through and change the

580
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:04,479
variables if you wanted to and get

581
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:06,129
something that looks drastically

582
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:07,359
different or if you wanted to you could

583
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,609
make a whole nother version and and sub

584
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:10,899
that in you can make a whole nother repo

585
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:15,179
and sub that in for your own theme the

586
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,469
default topcoat theme is an example

587
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:20,439
theme that I built out that has two

588
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,089
variations dark and light so that you

589
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:24,039
could actually show how it works how you

590
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,569
could actually achieve a dark and light

591
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:29,199
theme with one set of one set of style

592
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:34,929
files and if you want to look at the

593
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:38,409
insides of that so it uses a convention

594
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:40,749
over configuration i'm making some

595
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:41,769
taking some liberties here and being

596
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:44,169
like well if you name it theme dash can

597
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:45,759
you see that yeah okay if you name it

598
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:46,869
theme dashed you probably want to

599
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:48,639
generate this is your theme file you

600
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:50,199
want to generate that into a final CSS

601
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:54,039
so this just imports variables right so

602
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,599
I have dark variables it has exactly

603
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,069
what you'd expect the dark colors and

604
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,109
the dark icons and as a light variables

605
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:01,509
right the mobile is just sizing for

606
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:04,029
mobile and you can imagine if I had a

607
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:05,469
desktop variables desktop it would just

608
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:07,989
be the sizes for desktop we see those

609
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,989
two converging but slowly so I figure

610
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:12,549
this will set us up to succeed in the

611
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:14,199
area when desktop and mobile starts to

612
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,699
convert even more we can start

613
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,349
eliminating variables and have something

614
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:19,989
that's much more cohesive but if you

615
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:21,489
wanted to make your own theme you just

616
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:23,350
put in your own file theme dash

617
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,330
your theme and then add whatever

618
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,620
variables you want and it would compile

619
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,780
it into your final CSS this also allowed

620
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,370
for just static includes so if you

621
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,380
wanted to put in fonts or whatnot you

622
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,610
probably don't need any variables in

623
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,720
that you just slap it in there and it'll

624
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,309
actually compile it in your final just

625
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:44,320
as is so it's themes and what this

626
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,640
allows you to do is you know hone your

627
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,780
craft it that was one of the comments we

628
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,070
got when we were going out and talking

629
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,990
to people about you know does this

630
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,890
resonate with you would you use

631
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,020
something like top coat is M kept coming

632
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,880
back to them wanting to actually use our

633
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,770
tools more than our final output and

634
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,000
they wanted to actually see how we built

635
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,070
it and then use those tools to build

636
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,289
their own version i actually really like

637
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:04,659
that idea i like to be able to you know

638
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:06,159
expose all these tools and see what

639
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,150
people do with them because they could

640
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,620
probably do way more creative things

641
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,789
than i would so i can demo where we're

642
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:18,940
at right now mmm so I'm in the top coat

643
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,370
repo I pulled it down you can download

644
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,760
just from the website a final built

645
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,710
version just use the CSS from there but

646
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,789
if you wanted to make your own build

647
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:29,559
this is what you do it's just using

648
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,480
grunts oh I run drunk when it does is

649
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,100
it's going out it's getting the version

650
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,890
of the tag version of the repo pulling

651
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,530
it down the zip and then it's going to

652
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,500
open up the zip pull out all the style

653
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,179
files compile them all together based

654
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:44,980
off of the you know convention over

655
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,480
configuration and make this final

656
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,059
release CSS and copy over all the assets

657
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,120
the images and the phones and what that

658
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,720
gives you when you're all done is a

659
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,179
style guide so it'll generate the style

660
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:01,390
guide in so using style taco so you can

661
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,220
just copy and paste from here this is a

662
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,440
live working style guide you can see the

663
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,179
CSS that's that's with it if you

664
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:09,039
actually wanted to go and look at how we

665
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,350
were doing stuff yeah so this is what we

666
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,770
have so far and actually that shows both

667
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,919
of the variations the dark and the light

668
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,600
creations of the theme so what if you

669
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,280
just wanted you know the header you

670
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,630
didn't care about our search inputs or

671
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,980
whatnot you could actually go through

672
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,480
and make your another build get

673
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,169
composure and build

674
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,350
so I could go in through here and be

675
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,440
like well I don't need that and I only

676
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,850
want navigation bar so just run the

677
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,289
build again once you have that in there

678
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:51,179
this is the same thing with them if you

679
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:52,350
had a theme if you like made your own

680
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,820
theme you even want to pull ours down

681
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,140
from get you could actually just drop it

682
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,549
in that in the right folder and it would

683
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:59,580
run the build again and pull in your

684
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,940
changes so it built I could probably

685
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,610
just go back here and refresh and see

686
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,070
all I have now is the header right so

687
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,929
this way you can customize your own

688
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:25,260
builds one of those okay so really

689
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,399
interested in contribution that's why

690
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,570
we're sharing it so early I mean we've

691
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,470
only been working on this for three

692
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,090
months and you can see we only have a

693
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,440
few of the components componentized

694
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,590
right and we'd like to see what people

695
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,210
are interested in and one of the best

696
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,320
ways you could do that is actually file

697
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,970
issues or make comments on stuff that

698
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,700
we've already made because i like to

699
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,870
think that it's open source enough open

700
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,850
source like it actually is one want it

701
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,110
to be community-driven we don't want to

702
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,789
just be making something and bestowing

703
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:49,440
it on the masses right we want people to

704
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,090
actually say this is what I want can you

705
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,409
help me build it or this is what I want

706
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,390
and I've already built it here you go so

707
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,669
it actually grows that way so we're not

708
00:27:56,669 --> 00:28:00,809
we're actually being useful all of this

709
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,309
can be found on top coat that I oh it's

710
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,380
all alive you can see all of our code

711
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,500
and I'm damned and this is Gish on
