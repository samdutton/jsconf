1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,750

so high this is JavaScript and web

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,240
standards to the quickening are there

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,070
any Highlander fans out here the movie

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,910
Highlander yeah whew okay cool well I'm

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,380
only going to reference it once in this

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,029
presentation because I realized that I

7
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,080
don't think a lot of people like

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,540
Highlander so I'm realistic most of the

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,250
Star Wars but there'd be a high languid

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,640
for so get ready to get ready for it so

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,440
I'm John Lucas and I am an interactive

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,060
development director at a small rug

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,790
design studio I focused mainly in

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,380
front-end development but because we

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,149
have a small studio I've done some

16
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,920
information architecture design reviews

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,170
CMS implications we sort of all diver

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,140
and each other's jobs and I work at a

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,850
company called happy cog and it was

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,070
founded by this guy Jeffrey's admin and

21
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,929
he wrote a book designing with web

22
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,300
standards we also published a list of

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,030
part com which is a online magazine for

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,980
people who make websites and we do a

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,780
conference and event depart a few times

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,380
a year so happy cog we work with a bunch

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,870
of different clients from the Holocaust

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,070
Museum in the u.s. to Mozilla Georgetown

29
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,960
zappers and dictionary com which

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,990
actually you saw earlier I also brought

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,240
sporadically about Hades music unicorns

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,280
and my web crushes at John Lucas calm

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,920
and I contribute to the nerdery net

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,119
which is a website for developers and

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:37,690
lastly i love web standards it's losing

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,979
okay I think it's stuck in my hair now

37
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:42,899
saliva standards is this idea of the set

38
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,490
of guidelines that provide the greatest

39
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,829
benefit to the greatest number of web

40
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,140
users and the idea goes on to illustrate

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,780
that by using web standards you lower

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,210
the cost of production and so building

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,070
on a solid foundation there's less

44
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,259
upkeep in the future and so when

45
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,000
websites and browsing devices of all

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,750
people still be ready for it so my

47
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,969
highlander metaphor in the movie

48
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,039
Highlander there's a group of immortals

49
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,590
that fight to the death which kind of

50
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,569
doesn't make sense but they do

51
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,269
and they kill each other by beheading is

52
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,310
the only way and when they do it there's

53
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,469
like these giant lightning bolts come

54
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:21,299
down and it's called the quickening and

55
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:23,730
there's all this action and I'm every so

56
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,010
there can be only one and it's really

57
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,920
dramatic and it's kind of awesome um so

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,040
there can be only one but not really the

59
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,180
stuff I'm going to talk about today is

60
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,609
how i like to make websites the people

61
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,950
that come to us come to us because we do

62
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,840
standard support this isn't going to be

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,599
applicable to every project that you do

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,639
but for me this is how i believe in

65
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,159
making a web so Knollys reserve set in

66
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,709
stone but with that in mind my favorite

67
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,349
rule is your site should work without

68
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:55,379
JavaScript um the sites that I work on

69
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,449
the most important aspects of the site

70
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:59,730
aren't the graphic design or the

71
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,859
animations or CMS implementation it's

72
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,230
the content and so we want to make sure

73
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,060
that our content is accessible everyone

74
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,469
including users that don't have

75
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:10,079
javascript enabled and of course we do

76
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,250
that with our good friend progressive

77
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,060
enhancement and we all know that's XHTML

78
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,209
poster CSS plus your JavaScript or your

79
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,500
content your presentation and your

80
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,250
behavior so why do we do this well we

81
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,540
talked about the importance of content

82
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,069
but really how many people are we

83
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,389
worried about who really turns off

84
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,329
JavaScript anymore well first let me get

85
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,069
my audience participation going on here

86
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,169
and ask you one of my favorite questions

87
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,579
how many of you guys test for Safari how

88
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,000
many of you all a test for chrome and

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,540
how many of you test for opera yeah and

90
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,769
how many of you test your sites without

91
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:52,199
JavaScript ok couple different sites are

92
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,280
going to give you different stats on

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,280
this but here's a few and you'll see

94
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,840
that the numbers for users without

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,299
JavaScript are actually larger than the

96
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:01,949
numbers of people that use a certain

97
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,900
browser Safari um and I get it stats you

98
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,120
know you can read them how you will I'm

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,650
but now I'm gonna ask you another

100
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,969
question how many of you ride bikes oh

101
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:17,100
no one writes like okay

102
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,930
and let's pretend you were to ride a

103
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,030
bike if you were to ride a bike how many

104
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,090
of you would ride a bike with a helmet

105
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,790
okay a couple how many of you drive a

106
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,960
bike with a helmet if you're only going

107
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,460
a couple of blocks okay bad metaphor so

108
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,290
I always write a bike with a helmet back

109
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,880
at home because I can't control what

110
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,920
other people are doing so pedestrians

111
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,150
could be running across the street and

112
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,160
drivers in Philadelphia are kind of

113
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,900
crazy and I can't control what other

114
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,220
people are going to do so all I can do

115
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,100
is protect myself so if I'm quoting a

116
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,050
website and there's only one person

117
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,580
that's browsing and without javascript

118
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,440
but that person is the president of the

119
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,210
company of a site that I'm working for

120
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,740
well then I'm going to make sure that

121
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,690
they can view the content I recently was

122
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,280
working on a project and one of the main

123
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,100
stakeholders only tested the site

124
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,950
primarily on the iPad and that's fine

125
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,870
our site should still work on the iPad

126
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,850
but it just was new to us to have

127
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,650
someone primarily focused on something

128
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,510
as opposed to firefox or internet

129
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,770
explorer so making sure your site works

130
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,290
without JavaScript now make sure make

131
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,880
sure it will work with Java without

132
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,880
JavaScript later so if the kindle pre

133
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,880
pad 8g megatouch pod comes out one day

134
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,740
and it doesn't support javascript you'll

135
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,950
be all set and whether it been

136
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,870
improvements in how search engines want

137
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,030
to handle javascript the most foolproof

138
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,590
method to making sure you get the best

139
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,440
SEO and to read the content is to have

140
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,490
it on the page and to begin with so I'll

141
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,100
be the first to admit that I really

142
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,780
rushed the code on my personal site you

143
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,370
know it's got unicorns it's kind of

144
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,920
silly and when I look at the CSS it

145
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,330
really kind of makes me cringe a little

146
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,580
bit I rush through it I used to be

147
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,320
really careful about making sure my

148
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,180
youtube videos in bed but now I'll just

149
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,950
go on a kick and i'll just start copying

150
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,540
and pasting and nothing validates

151
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,260
anymore and so I'm guilty of it too but

152
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,420
if I'm ever looking to hire someone the

153
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,530
first thing I'm going to do is go to the

154
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,870
personal site I'm going to see how it

155
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,610
works with text resizing i'm going to

156
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,960
view source and then i'm going to see

157
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,270
how it works with javascript disabled so

158
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,070
if you want to make sure that your site

159
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,960
is a reflection of yourself then that's

160
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,420
something that i would think about doing

161
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,210
and then there's some of us that find

162
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,650
that reading with w3c docs is a great

163
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,720
to spend a Friday night and I'm sort of

164
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,180
guilty of this i really i really like

165
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:41,080
guidelines so making sure that your site

166
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,789
works without javascript is complying

167
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:44,830
with the wicked recommendations and they

168
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,910
require that your content and

169
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,160
functionality be accessible with

170
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,840
scripting disabled and that users should

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,580
be alerted if javascript changes any

172
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,840
content on the page so back to who turns

173
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,699
off javascript anyway you know

174
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,139
javascript can be a pretty scary thing

175
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,690
to the users of the interwebs it's got a

176
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,280
history of being the sneaky guy on the

177
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
block and breaking your browsing and

178
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,600
unresponsive scripts and errors and

179
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,070
those alerts that you can't ever get out

180
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,370
of so I have a confession to make I was

181
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,949
working on this and last week I started

182
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:16,510
thinking I'm like is this even true

183
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,060
anymore it seems like Java scripts

184
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,680
really sort of mellowed out and everyone

185
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,849
sort of been like oh it it's not that

186
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:25,419
creepy it's ok javascript and then the

187
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,160
next morning I was on the bus on the way

188
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,560
to work and I was checking my Twitter on

189
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,599
my phone and I see this and I'm like

190
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,430
what's going on Simon you know what's

191
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,900
what's what's your beef with the

192
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,020
JavaScript and so then as i'm sure you

193
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,210
all saw there was some of this going on

194
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,599
this week so then the tweets just kept

195
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,599
coming what's with all the garbage code

196
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,949
in my Twitter stream and what's going on

197
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,960
javascript code is automatically sending

198
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,050
things and then you've got the people

199
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,409
ready to abandon ship and then you've

200
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:03,760
got the people ready to make money off

201
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,530
this and i would totally buy one of

202
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,099
those t-shirts then you have people that

203
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,690
were trying to make it work but

204
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,919
unfortunately it didn't work without

205
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,669
javascript and then my personal favorite

206
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:18,760
we finally gone somewhere so when the

207
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,620
number 8 most visited site on the

208
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,500
internet gets a bad rap like this that's

209
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,030
when people start turning to things like

210
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,190
no script and that's when people start

211
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,139
turning to things like upping their

212
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,150
internet security and turning off

213
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,599
javascript in their browsers let's take

214
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,089
a look at some site examples so here's a

215
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:38,890
design studio and they've got this

216
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,900
really nice moving around going to

217
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,930
is there space there sky there's land

218
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,880
there's a contact form you can fill out

219
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,550
the contact form you could not fill it

220
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,770
out and then get error alerts really

221
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,010
nice and then seeing this with

222
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,180
javascript disabled so I now start on

223
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,520
the contact page and then of the links

224
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,160
are working anymore so I can still

225
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,520
contact maybe I'm not getting any

226
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,200
confirmation messages but why am I going

227
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,790
to contact someone if I can't see their

228
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,780
offers or their portfolio this is

229
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,230
another example and so clicking on about

230
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,510
updates the content but you still just

231
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,310
scroll so it's a little silly so you're

232
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,690
doing one shortcut but then still

233
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,270
needing to use the scroll bar and then

234
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,020
when you look at the site without

235
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,000
javascript and you're clicking on these

236
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,030
links nothing's happening so here's a

237
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,130
navigation that's not working and then I

238
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,050
noticed that there is still a scroll bar

239
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,540
up here so i can still scroll down and

240
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,920
get the content so that's one step

241
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,630
better because we're still able to

242
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,300
access this though I've got this

243
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,920
navigation that's really confusing to a

244
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,750
user because it doesn't work and then

245
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,070
I'm also noticing I've got this weird

246
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,600
horizontal scroll so what does this

247
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,420
thing do and so I spelled out oh look

248
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,620
here's the helpdesk form and so just by

249
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,510
making sure the navigation works or

250
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,010
jumps to something and making sure that

251
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,080
your styling is okay is a step on how

252
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,230
they could have made this better my text

253
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,510
editor of choices Kota I love it I think

254
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,370
it's fantastic and this is their website

255
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,860
and you can browse through to see the

256
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,020
stuff it does it's got this nice neat

257
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,450
interface you can use the arrows to

258
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:26,720
scroll through or the tabs and then when

259
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,160
I disable JavaScript and refresh the

260
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,730
page I can still get to the content but

261
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,320
it does this weird jumping down things

262
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,910
so now I have to scroll back up every

263
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,110
time I want to change something was

264
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,120
really distracting as a user I just want

265
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,380
to learn about your product I want to

266
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,300
buy it but it's really confusing and

267
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,490
then I still have these arrows here they

268
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,900
are trying to call this JavaScript but

269
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,760
of course nothing's happening so way

270
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,290
that they can prove this is you want to

271
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,560
write your arrows to the page with

272
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,450
and not include it in the source where

273
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,690
it's not going to work for someone so

274
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,460
let's say your site's just not going to

275
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,600
work with JavaScript it's just not

276
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,610
that's not your audience it's fine well

277
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,740
this is safer our do and this is what

278
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,150
happens when you come to this site with

279
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,540
JavaScript on without it you get an

280
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,860
error message telling you that you need

281
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,200
to have javascript enabled so fine at

282
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,850
least I know it's not user error when I

283
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,290
come to this site which is nice it's

284
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,550
given me a message I'm not doing

285
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,839
anything wrong I do need to have

286
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,600
JavaScript it's a little harsh here's

287
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,350
another site it's a design site and this

288
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,570
goes about it a little bit nicer and so

289
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,850
it says javascript is disabled in your

290
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,339
current web browser exclamation because

291
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:34,450
parts of the site or coated with

292
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,130
JavaScript certain features might not be

293
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,810
available to you if you have the

294
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,930
possibility please activate javascript

295
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,210
exclamation so you still can access some

296
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,890
of the other content on the site but you

297
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,240
also have this really nice polite

298
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,470
message that doesn't make you feel like

299
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,460
a jerk for having javascript disabled

300
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,330
this is what happens if you come to

301
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,430
facebook without JavaScript and again

302
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,230
you get an error message and it's

303
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,670
highlighted in yellow so you're

304
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,680
automatically drawn to it but the thing

305
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,180
with this is if you can't turn on

306
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,160
JavaScript you're still able to access

307
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,270
the site because they let you have

308
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,460
access to the mobile version so you can

309
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,960
sign in and you can still know that the

310
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,390
phillies are playing or that someone has

311
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,220
poked you but that's kind of creepy so i

312
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,680
actually wish they'd get rid of that I'm

313
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,820
moving on your site should be keyboard

314
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,620
accessible users with visual

315
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,690
disabilities have a strong reliance on

316
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,730
the keyboard as well as users you just

317
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,560
choose to use the keyboard for speed or

318
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,350
convenience this is another part of

319
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,839
adhering to web standards and when you

320
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,360
users hover over an event and it pops up

321
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,339
in information box or pulls in an ajax

322
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,320
menu sometimes we forget to copy that

323
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,160
over to the focus as well along with

324
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,540
that your site should also be screen

325
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,940
reader accessible so updates are often

326
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,170
missed by people with assistive

327
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,720
technologies because they expect a

328
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,610
change to happen with a navigate event

329
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,890
so if you click on a link or your submit

330
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,209
a form is usually when you expect

331
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,610
something to change so web apps often

332
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,170
use these techniques to update content

333
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,610
in the background and then users are

334
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,830
unaware of it

335
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,750
um this demo is really cool it is a

336
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,960
lightbox effects using jQuery UI and you

337
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,370
can go through the images with your

338
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,970
keyboard it's got a nice loader you can

339
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,190
also use your mouse I think it captured

340
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,820
my mouse but I'm clicking you can escape

341
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:31,030
by either clicking or pressing escape

342
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,780
you can still tab through using your

343
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,470
keyboard to all the other photos and

344
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,580
then what's also really neat about this

345
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,060
is it updates the URL so i can grab the

346
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,760
URL from this send it to someone if i

347
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,350
want to show them a picture of someone

348
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,360
walking out and then i can automatically

349
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,350
load that URL right away with javascript

350
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,390
disabled this still works i can still

351
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,370
get through with my keyboard access and

352
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,610
i can still go right to the picture this

353
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,580
does something else really neat and that

354
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,310
moves into the next point is declaring

355
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,960
yourself as an application and letting

356
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,960
users know that you're a nap so what all

357
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,670
of you are doing with javascript these

358
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,560
days and web application is becoming so

359
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,990
fancy it's a bit more complicated to

360
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,810
make your content accessible web apps

361
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,550
are emulating desktop apps and I don't

362
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,710
think a way that anyone or a lot of

363
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,750
people didn't think was possible and one

364
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,890
of the things that's been plaguing the

365
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,140
good name of Ajax is that updating the

366
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,580
content in the background and not being

367
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,090
screen reader accessible and that's

368
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,220
where way Aria comes in and this allows

369
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,810
web pages to declare themselves as

370
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,430
widgets or applications rather than

371
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,770
static documents we use the role

372
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,650
property and state information to

373
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,560
declare itself as a dynamic web app I

374
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,390
also extends the tabindex attribute and

375
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,450
so it goes beyond the a area but an

376
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,610
input object select and text area where

377
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,290
you would normally use those and allows

378
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,730
it to be applied to any element such as

379
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,760
a div or spam you can also use tab index

380
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,680
of negative 1 here and that will take

381
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,120
things that shouldn't be in the natural

382
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,430
tab order out of the flow of the page so

383
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,840
you have a nested tree item and you

384
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,460
don't want anyone to access that right

385
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,990
away it won't be until you

386
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,500
programmatically tell it to be so here's

387
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,390
an example of a spam that has the

388
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,000
tabindex defined

389
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,980
span is being used as a checkbox element

390
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,230
so you want to keep the tabindex of zero

391
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,430
because you still want users to be able

392
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,350
to access this with our keyboard if we

393
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,820
done negative one again that would have

394
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,950
left it out you'll also notice here the

395
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,050
role attribute and this is being used

396
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,940
here to specify that a span is being

397
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,840
used as a checkbox so roll attributes

398
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,600
were borrowed from XHTML and the idea is

399
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,970
it allows you to add machine extractable

400
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,620
semantic information about the purpose

401
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,990
of an element this paved the way for

402
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,670
Aria to use this and provide role

403
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,000
information to excessive technologies so

404
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,970
you can define things like alerts

405
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,670
dialogues menus tree items sliders

406
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:04,310
buttons progress meters etc along with

407
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,840
that you can also use roles to define

408
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,270
the grid in structure of a document

409
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,550
their document landmark roles and they

410
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,260
describe the area of the site a user is

411
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,680
in navigation article main complementary

412
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,660
search and banner just to name a few of

413
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,830
them arias states and properties tell

414
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,300
users how to interact with these widgets

415
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,150
so for checkbox you can define whether

416
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,160
or not the checkbox is checked by using

417
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,380
the Aria checked property and you can

418
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,540
set it to true or false or if you have

419
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,400
form fields and some are required you

420
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,380
can let a user know by using re required

421
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,660
equals true and this helps a lot you go

422
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,820
beyond the asterisks that some of us use

423
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,070
to define a check box or a form field

424
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,900
being required which really doesn't tell

425
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,220
a user very much if items are changed in

426
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,600
a document than are you uses live

427
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,440
regions and this lets a user know they

428
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,820
can do this though without using the

429
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,620
current place in the site with our you

430
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,630
arrive you have three choices you have

431
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,460
off which means the region isn't life

432
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,579
you have polite which means that users

433
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,560
are notified that there's a change but

434
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,970
not interrupted of their current task

435
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,189
and you have assertive for more urgent

436
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:12,890
priority content so if there's a form

437
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,240
error that's when you'd want to use

438
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,310
something like that and you can also use

439
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,589
the aria busy state and that's lets a

440
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,970
user know that contents still being

441
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,680
updated and you can use the earlier

442
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,420
relevant property and that will define

443
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,189
additions or removals of nodes in the

444
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:28,820
Dom I'm Aaron Gustafson made this tab

445
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,430
interface demo and it

446
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,380
really awesome not just because it's

447
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,570
about pumpkin pie but um so here's how

448
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,830
you make pumpkin pie and here's how it

449
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,690
looks with JavaScript enabled and you've

450
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,190
got your four tabs on top and each one

451
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,690
corresponds to the section like

452
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,260
ingredients and directions this is how

453
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,580
the site the site looks without

454
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,380
JavaScript so you'll see all the

455
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,600
contents still on the page and taking a

456
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,800
look at the source it's completely

457
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,660
semantics you've got your heading levels

458
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,010
with everything corresponding underneath

459
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,960
it and then with JavaScript it turns it

460
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,480
into the tab set and then you'll see

461
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,850
here that you'll see some of the Aria

462
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,220
roles being defined so the aria selected

463
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,340
equals true the role equals tab bre a

464
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,340
hidden and viewed and it's really nice

465
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,180
and then i don't think i have found but

466
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,660
if you want to go to this you guys are

467
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,980
going to be able to hear that right with

468
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,930
a screen reader this totally works and

469
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,000
you're able to hear what tab that you're

470
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,390
currently on and you can get to

471
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,400
everything that you need to if anyone's

472
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,500
interested in this link it's up there or

473
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,210
I can send it to you so next up with

474
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,650
javascript is you don't want to

475
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,780
interrupt the workflow javascript should

476
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,430
be used to enhance a user's experience

477
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,980
in a website not distract them or take

478
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,170
away and there's some sites that do this

479
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,130
really well um flickr is one of the most

480
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,620
i love the interaction of the site it's

481
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,070
amazing i I can do so much from my login

482
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,500
page without even leaving it i can add

483
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,330
people as contacts or cancel it i can

484
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,800
expand collapse almost everything on

485
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,660
this page and get an error but i still

486
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,770
get um not an error and alert message

487
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,480
this is really neat if you collapse your

488
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,370
groups thing it updates your message

489
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,990
with nothing new here recently bored

490
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,150
look for a new group so it's it's

491
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,890
responding to what the user is doing

492
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,450
there thinking oh they're bored of this

493
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,890
so let's give them something they can do

494
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,230
you can refresh content if you look at

495
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,270
your photo stream page and you can

496
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,700
update your titles right from there you

497
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,540
can cancel you could update it to talk

498
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,330
about that one of your bosses is eating

499
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,550
meat and then you get this yellow

500
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,630
highlight so you know that you've

501
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,300
changed something

502
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,340
you can delete things or you can cancel

503
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,500
them with us alert it's really easy to

504
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,090
use and I don't have to go through ten

505
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,200
page refreshes looking at individual

506
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,670
photo page you can add things right to

507
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,160
the map from here this saves the user so

508
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,690
much time and it's all about these

509
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,220
enhancements that make this experience

510
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,530
so great I mean I can't think of anyone

511
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,530
who doesn't like Flickr and if you do we

512
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,080
can talk about it later but um it's such

513
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,170
a neat website you can add contacts

514
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,120
right from here you can delete contacts

515
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,480
right from here and I think sometimes we

516
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,340
take for granted how easy the site is

517
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,590
for us and other sites that make you go

518
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,390
jump through hoops in order to be able

519
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:35,900
to do this content okay so internet

520
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,920
explorer 6 everything that's html5 and

521
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,380
css3 is really cool these days and I

522
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,820
know a lot of people are moving towards

523
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,560
this like let's not support ie6 anymore

524
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,820
and that may or may not be right again I

525
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,590
work with the types of clients that

526
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,540
we're not going to do that we are going

527
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,600
to make sure our sites work in ie6 but

528
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,310
you can still do this and push the web

529
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,650
forward sometimes a little bit of double

530
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,110
work but an example this is making your

531
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,090
forms easy to use and the wick ektu

532
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,710
guidelines state that you should help

533
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,800
users avoid and correct mistakes and one

534
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,570
of the ways that a user majority

535
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,950
interacts with your website is is

536
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,360
filling up forms and there's a lot of

537
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,550
room for user error you can use

538
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,770
JavaScript to help with some of this

539
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,720
with the client side validation but in

540
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,490
html5 there's some really neat new type

541
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,890
M additions that will help hopefully

542
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,540
take some of the burden off of

543
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,080
JavaScript the nice thing about starting

544
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,640
an implant implement these new input

545
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,350
types is that if a browser doesn't

546
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,360
recognize it so like type equal search

547
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,810
it will default back to type equals txt

548
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,490
if the validation of things like making

549
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,930
sure a telephone number is invalid

550
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,720
format fell to the browser's instead it

551
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,750
would save developers a lot of time to

552
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,060
focus on other things like accessibility

553
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,960
and like good interaction of course if

554
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,340
you are going to implement any of these

555
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,860
I would still say to do a JavaScript

556
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,250
back

557
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,050
for browsers that don't support this so

558
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,020
again it's sort of double work but it's

559
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,320
moving the web I think in a great place

560
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,630
to talk to a little more about search

561
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,100
here's an example of a site in safari

562
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,230
with JavaScript turned on a lot of

563
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,550
people have become really big on using

564
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,560
the placeholder attribute these days to

565
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,750
fill in the value in a search box and I

566
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,120
see here that the search here is really

567
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,560
similar to the search that's built in in

568
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,570
the browser so I'm familiar with how

569
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,570
this works as a user and I think that

570
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,390
without a submit button I still think I

571
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,680
can type and something will happen and

572
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,500
sure enough i start typing and I get my

573
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,380
suggestive results ok cool I find what I

574
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,360
want I select it and here my nice neat

575
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,590
organized results if i look at this page

576
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,200
in firefox with javascript off firefox

577
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,210
doesn't support placeholder or it didn't

578
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,520
on this browser don't think it does and

579
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,530
so here i'm not really sure here's a

580
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,620
square box because I'm a Mac user maybe

581
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,970
they think i know that's a search form

582
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,240
because I'm I'm hip to the web but I go

583
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,990
in I start typing and nothing happens

584
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,730
but then again because I'm a Mac user

585
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,530
maybe I'm used to forms that i can hit

586
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,950
enter to submit this form so it's emits

587
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,020
but as you can see you go to broken

588
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,850
experience and these are places if

589
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,320
you're using the placeholder for things

590
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,360
that are more important besides search

591
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,280
like enter a zip code and you're not

592
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,380
sure if you should enter a zip or state

593
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,420
or country those are places where you're

594
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,080
not going to want to rely on that I'm

595
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,490
going to skip through this because I'm

596
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,640
running out of time a little but css3

597
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,700
animations can be your friend if you

598
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,980
were once relying on JavaScript you just

599
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,480
add some enhancements there's some

600
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,620
really neat things that you can do these

601
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:50,100
days with the css3 here's a few examples

602
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:53,930
there's more if you want to make a nice

603
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,740
interface for your Michael Jackson CDs a

604
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,300
a tab interface it's a little wonky at

605
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,280
times if you if you go between the two

606
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,740
tabs then you'll have this and of course

607
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,480
if you're not on the first tab then

608
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,740
it's always going to default back to

609
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,679
that this site's really neat they did a

610
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,770
comparison of css3 animations with the

611
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,380
jQuery equivalents and you can pop open

612
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,780
the code and see what things are like in

613
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,760
css3 and then see what things are like

614
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,010
in the jQuery so that being said you

615
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,740
should be aware of distracting

616
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,799
unnecessary animations on a more serious

617
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,150
side of that the wick egg

618
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,970
recommendations also limit flashing

619
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,650
animations as it can affect people with

620
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,400
photosensitive epilepsy if you remember

621
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,140
a few years back this happened on an

622
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,179
absolute epilepsy support message board

623
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,160
and people injected this code that did

624
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,080
produce these animations with JavaScript

625
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,059
that had a lot of serious effects on

626
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,470
people on a less serious side i'm going

627
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,710
to skip to this one sometimes animations

628
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,809
are really cool for a design site and

629
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:05,460
they're going through and it's really

630
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,740
neat it could be a little bit

631
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,679
distracting but you're probably trying

632
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:11,880
to show off the things that you can do

633
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,290
so it's totally acceptable in this

634
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,120
content but there's still a ways that

635
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,620
you can make this a bit more accessible

636
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,200
if that navigation on the top was fixed

637
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,030
then someone could easily jump around to

638
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,669
content so go ahead and push the web but

639
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:25,080
also think about ways to make it more

640
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:32,730
usable this is a site that does it

641
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,320
really nice the animations are really

642
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,620
fast so you still get the effect of neat

643
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,110
little navigating around and then the

644
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,850
site still also works without JavaScript

645
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,669
I won't show you all this to save time

646
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:47,669
but it'll jump through to the proper

647
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:51,240
place choose your visual indicators

648
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,100
wisely and when you have javascript

649
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,530
functionality and users user should know

650
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,270
what they're going to do when they click

651
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,770
on something or something is happening

652
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:03,410
so here's a site for some ipad apps or I

653
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,730
wow I just forgot the word but you get

654
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,770
what I'm saying and you can see when you

655
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,210
click on these it automatically changes

656
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,419
the content on the right hand side so

657
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:13,679
this happens with almost all of them

658
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,960
except the first two when you click on

659
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,760
them even though the icons look the same

660
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,679
as the rest these actually open a new

661
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,630
page so as a user I wasn't expecting

662
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,330
that at all

663
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,130
based on the rest of the interface so

664
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,220
maybe a little you know arrow icon or

665
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,899
something to let a user know that

666
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:30,309
they're going to be taking off this page

667
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:34,090
that they were just on also you should

668
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,289
let your users know something is

669
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,299
happening if your Java scripts going to

670
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,769
take a long time to load something then

671
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:41,220
use loaders to visually indicate that

672
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,149
here's another example of site that

673
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:44,409
doesn't more of these navigational

674
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:46,120
things but you'll see they pop up that

675
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,070
loader to make sure that you know

676
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,380
nothing's broken your computer's

677
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,850
thinking and something's going to change

678
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,169
another aspect of JavaScript and web

679
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:59,470
standards is share what you have to push

680
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,149
the web forward it's really nice to it

681
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:02,620
will share content and how you did

682
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,510
things one of the problems with using a

683
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,380
propriety a proprietary system like

684
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,480
flash is that unless someone writes one

685
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,769
of those demos you're not going to know

686
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:14,559
how someone made what they made so

687
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,059
here's a asteroids game and you can

688
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:20,889
download the JavaScript source code and

689
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,320
it's using html5 canvas and JavaScript

690
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,240
and it's really cool but I can still

691
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,340
learn how someone made this and that's

692
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,010
going to help teach everyone of how to

693
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,299
keep making these really cool things

694
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,010
it's not going to help me be better at

695
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,860
asteroids but besides that it's still

696
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,250
pretty cool um lastly this was touched

697
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,409
on it before but use JavaScript

698
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,019
libraries they are doing so much already

699
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:46,330
of support these days it's so neat the

700
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,559
stuff that all you guys are making out

701
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,570
there the other great part about using a

702
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,940
JavaScript library is for your clients

703
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,679
there's so much documentation about it

704
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,419
when you're writing all your custom

705
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:58,059
stuff maybe when you're passing that off

706
00:27:58,059 --> 00:27:59,289
to a client they're not going to know

707
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:01,120
how to build on that when you use a

708
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,549
popular library and then people can look

709
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,289
up anything and help maintain their own

710
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:09,600
site and so that about wraps it up and
