1
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,599

so true is true but you can cast stuff

2
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,750
in JavaScript so we could make true cast

3
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,059
to one if we wanted to which means you

4
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:46,680
could do true plus true equals to anyone

5
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,280
know what this is going to do pulse see

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,019
what else I got the top of my head just

7
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,010
for fun the array one's fun yeah anyone

8
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,339
know what's going to happen here it's

9
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:08,250
true as you'd expect in the double

10
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,380
equals operator or sometimes called the

11
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,799
abstract equals operator it'll cast the

12
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,780
thing on the right so if I'm doing this

13
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,939
it's actually false and when something

14
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,469
is false on the right it's going to cast

15
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:24,479
it to an integer which means it will

16
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,009
cast the other side to an integer which

17
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,619
effectively is like saying is 1 equal to

18
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,920
1 which is why this guy is equal to this

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,420
guy another way to do this would be to

20
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,880
say false

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,380
you get the idea it let's talk

22
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,719
about we're supposed to talk about so my

23
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,850
name's Brian i work in adobe with

24
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,429
christopher joseph here and you probably

25
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:56,469
know that we work on the phone gap team

26
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,390
but we also started working on a new

27
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,990
problem at adobe and that was CSS and so

28
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,710
our answer is top coat and the sort of

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,750
pitch tagline is it CSS for building

30
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,729
fast and clean apps and everybody is

31
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,129
already thinking well why the hell are

32
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:13,930
these guys doing another CSS framework

33
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,190
and there's a lot of them right we've

34
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,680
got Twitter bootstrap we've got a serb

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,989
foundation there's a new thing from

36
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:26,560
yahoo called pure which is cool the

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,420
problem that we were running into

38
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,670
consistently at least in phonegap land

39
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,019
people will go to build an application

40
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,299
and they'll quickly grab twitter

41
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,690
bootstrap they'll throw it in there and

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,709
their app will be slow and they'll be

43
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,230
like oh phonegap sucks which isn't

44
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,810
entirely true so twitter bootstrap is a

45
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,880
meg of CSS is a good chance you do not

46
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,650
need that much CSS to make your buttons

47
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,010
consistent on single platform the other

48
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,480
problem is Twitter bootstrap changes all

49
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,280
the time so there's upgrades that you

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,569
have to do and they change their class

51
00:02:58,569 --> 00:02:59,889
names when they're doing it and so

52
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:05,230
maintenance is a huge problem yeah so

53
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,440
another huge issues the the patterns

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,600
that are inside of bootstrapper are huge

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,549
and then kind of all-encompassing and

56
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:13,810
comprehensive and think about the

57
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,739
context of being a website not a nap so

58
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,730
these were all the problems that we're

59
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,680
running into and then Christopher was

60
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,420
working on the reflow team in Adobe and

61
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,470
they were running the same kind of

62
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,630
problems building desktop applications

63
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,549
and we thought well okay if we're

64
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:29,079
building desktop apps and we're building

65
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,450
native mobile apps using HTML CSS and

66
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,590
JavaScript and we're running these

67
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,660
problems maybe we can work together to

68
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,310
solve them so another issue with CSS is

69
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,829
the dogpile syndrome so you'll take

70
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,569
you'll take your Twitter bootstrap or

71
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,950
your ZURB foundation you'll have this

72
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,660
gigantic file and you'll want to start

73
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,880
adding stuff to it and instead of going

74
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,870
and looking at what all those other

75
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,129
classes or you'll just start adding

76
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,170
stuff to it which means you

77
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,630
more and more CSS over time this is

78
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,920
terrible for maintenance and it's really

79
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,569
hard to perform upgrades and so you end

80
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,400
up just getting more and more CSS added

81
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
at the end and not less and if you look

82
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,120
at a lot of tools and analyze CSS now

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,349
it's really common to have like a class

84
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:09,569
gets used once in an application which

85
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,880
is crazy so we we want to fix this first

86
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,739
thing that we decide to do is to focus

87
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,410
on performance I don't think any other

88
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,910
CSS framework has ever been approached

89
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,750
this way they have I'm sorry but what

90
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,400
we're doing we're not just saying that

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,130
we're focusing on performance but were

92
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,660
benchmarking everything we do so I was

93
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,120
talking to the brackets team and I'm

94
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,710
like okay how you guys doing performance

95
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,180
and they're crazy there was a talk about

96
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,310
this yesterday where they were using

97
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,380
high-speed cameras to like see people's

98
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,690
type speed all kinds of nutty stuff and

99
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,550
I mentioned it a Paul Irish and he's

100
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,870
like oh you should just use the chrome

101
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,910
telemetry API and I'm like oh that's

102
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,130
cool what's that he's like hot well it's

103
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,780
not really documented but you can find

104
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,910
out about it so we did we dug in and

105
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,100
chrome telemetry API lets us measure all

106
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,100
kinds of performance metrics on on page

107
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,340
load on layout and on frames per second

108
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,340
and so as we're building topcoat we have

109
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,140
all these discrete components were

110
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,760
taking them and adding a whole bunch to

111
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,289
a page and we're scrolling that page up

112
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,789
and down are you going for oh yeah okay

113
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:18,870
we scroll the page up and down a whole

114
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,220
bunch of times and we take that data and

115
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,020
so we know on each commit whether or not

116
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,520
we're making topcoat faster or slower

117
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,470
and so by saying performance is our

118
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,030
first consideration this isn't just a

119
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,979
statement like we're you know marketing

120
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,450
to you but we're actually trying to be

121
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,430
empirical about it and know that we're

122
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,490
getting faster over time this all this

123
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,169
stuff by the way is open source and so

124
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,180
we're hoping at some point once we tool

125
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,410
this up and we get it working well

126
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,850
enough for ourselves it will be able to

127
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,130
share this or you'll be able to use this

128
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,930
for your topcoat based application so

129
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,910
you as your app the bulbs over time

130
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,960
you'll know if you're making it faster

131
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,780
or slower

132
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,810
yeah it's lent this is cool so like

133
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,820
these are all the various data points

134
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,040
that you can pull out I love that jank

135
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,840
is not only a word now it's a technical

136
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,910
term actually looked it up the other day

137
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,560
and the person who created the word jank

138
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,880
is actually in the audience right over

139
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,760
here names Joe nearest Elka so it's a

140
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,260
bit of a synthetic benchmarking though

141
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,480
our assumption right now is that if

142
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,400
we're making things faster in chrome it

143
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,080
gets faster everywhere else which is not

144
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,600
probably a really true statement and

145
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,820
once the other browsers give us the

146
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,440
ability to instrument them and get this

147
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,760
kind of data out of them we're totally

148
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,920
going to approach those two right now

149
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,960
Chrome's our best bet and I think it's

150
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,700
pretty safe to say if it gets slower in

151
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,490
chrome it's going to be slower elsewhere

152
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,140
this is a preview of a topcoat based

153
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,740
application this app was built for adobe

154
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,220
max for iOS and Android both handset and

155
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,770
tablet form factors in four weeks which

156
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,260
is amazing it performs really great you

157
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,690
can check it out for yourself that gives

158
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,030
you an idea what it looks like so

159
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,160
Christopher did a lot of the development

160
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,900
and we have a lot of sort of different

161
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,400
design goals that are not necessarily

162
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,950
complimentary or competing they're just

163
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,090
things that are important to us that I

164
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,200
don't think have been important to

165
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,960
traditional CSS frameworks so the first

166
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,340
thing that's important to us that we

167
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,350
want to be able to compose our builds

168
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,910
and Christopher is going to give a demo

169
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,880
of this in a minute but the idea here is

170
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,650
that we're separating the reset from the

171
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,210
layout from the aesthetic from the

172
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,980
platform that's running on and so if

173
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,810
you're on iOS you don't get a bunch of

174
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,520
gecko prefixes but when you go over to

175
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,110
Firefox OS you'll get all the right

176
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,840
Mozilla prefixes you might not want all

177
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,430
the aesthetics turned on or off so maybe

178
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,810
you just want the reset so you can

179
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,340
compose builds of all these controls

180
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,710
with just those things and as a kind of

181
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,120
consequence of having an architecture

182
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,190
that has discrete builds and performance

183
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,230
as a first characteristic we wanted to

184
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,910
make this thing super modular for our

185
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,820
own purposes too so making these things

186
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,670
separate boils right down to how we

187
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,740
manage ourselves in github so if you

188
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,490
jump in and github / top coat this does

189
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,470
look a little crazy but all of the

190
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,690
controls are an individual git repos but

191
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:06,940
this

192
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,100
wins us a huge benefit that that means

193
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,690
that when you're developing using top

194
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,030
coat and we update the button for a bug

195
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,100
only button updates and you don't have

196
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,630
to upgrade your entire top code

197
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,160
installation right now when you're

198
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,180
working with something like Twitter

199
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,310
bootstrap reserved foundation it's an

200
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,900
all-or-nothing proposition you have to

201
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,790
change a lot of files these builds

202
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,540
aren't discrete and they're not

203
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,250
independently version when they update

204
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,500
button they have to rev this entire CSS

205
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,520
file which is not ideal extensibility is

206
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,780
another thing so I showed you the

207
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,849
benchmark server which I'm really

208
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,310
excited about we talked to a whole bunch

209
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,470
of JavaScript and CSS developers about

210
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,380
how they're building applications and

211
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,690
they basically especially pros like Dave

212
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,370
Shay said I'm not going to use this

213
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,590
I'm a craftsman more like okay well

214
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,120
that's cool and then he saw our

215
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,440
benchmarking stuff and he's like but I

216
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,780
want that and so we think the more

217
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,880
important output of top coat isn't

218
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,800
actually the CSS that you can use

219
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,180
although that's a cool thing it's

220
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,850
probably the tools we're using to build

221
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,190
top coat itself so we're hoping that

222
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,660
this is kind of a something that will

223
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,090
encourage people to start building

224
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,930
applications that are performant by

225
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,200
default instead of talking a huge one

226
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,180
Meg CSS file at us and telling us we're

227
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,510
slow another angle is it and this is

228
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,370
funny because I'm at jas comp but top

229
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,370
code is only CSS but ironically almost

230
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,010
all top code is written using javascript

231
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,620
node so we didn't want any client

232
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,510
dependency I personally hated that about

233
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,400
other CSS frameworks that they're like

234
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,080
oh we're a framework but you also have

235
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,520
to load a whole bunch of jQuery plugins

236
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,130
for some reason not everybody likes

237
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:48,580
jQuery like me so mm Pete Hagan's I

238
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,600
guess topcoats open source like

239
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,880
everything we do to patch you to license

240
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
everything's on github we're looking for

241
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,020
people to help us build it our audience

242
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,339
is the web community but that's

243
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:01,780
everybody that's building apps and this

244
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,070
is also a little bit of a fuzzy

245
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,960
consideration it's not something I think

246
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,940
you should take too seriously but we're

247
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,620
building top coat for people building

248
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,060
applications and in particular

249
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,700
applications that are installed things

250
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,870
like brackets and reflow but also

251
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,300
phonegap and when you're building an app

252
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,820
there's a slight UI design idioms that

253
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,010
are different than

254
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,170
you're building a website top coat will

255
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,570
work for websites but instead of making

256
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,550
websites the first consideration we want

257
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,080
to make the interaction and design

258
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,780
patterns for web apps which where we

259
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,840
think the web is going and it's maybe

260
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,220
not just the web is going this way but

261
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,630
operating systems are going this way

262
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,950
you've got Chrome OS windows blue I

263
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,360
guess they're calling it now it was like

264
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,550
Windows RT or Metro before but it's

265
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,520
essentially JavaScript Firefox OS ties

266
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,330
in and we won't talk about webos these

267
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,340
are all these are all web operating

268
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,550
systems so you've got google microsoft

269
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,300
mozilla samsung Intel and I guess LG all

270
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,740
betting on the web is the future for

271
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,960
operating systems so topcoats probably

272
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,490
got a good feature in those places and

273
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,260
in the rest of it we can deal with

274
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,590
phonegap so if you want to check out the

275
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,900
controls themselves we've done a really

276
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,920
kind of Ponte job but of showing this

277
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,600
stuff off but if you go to the top coat

278
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,910
IO domain we're going to do a new site

279
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,160
very soon you can get a preview of what

280
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,900
the different controls look like there's

281
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,700
not a lot of surprises here this is just

282
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,410
CSS and these are just like basic

283
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,140
controls this aesthetic is generated

284
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,190
these aren't things that you were

285
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,050
telling you you have to build it this

286
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,580
stuff looks very Adobe and that's

287
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,630
probably because it's coming out of

288
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,700
Adobe but the theming capability allows

289
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,170
you to change absolutely every attribute

290
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:47,490
of these controls I kind of mentioned

291
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,840
that there's some perceived competitors

292
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,120
I don't think they really are until they

293
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,040
get into well I say this all the time

294
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,770
too and people think it's but the the

295
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,020
principles of topcoat are around

296
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,280
performance modularity discreteness and

297
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,530
accessibility basically everything that

298
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,980
these things don't do we do so I don't

299
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,830
know if they are competitors there's a

300
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,270
whole bunch of stuff for top coat so its

301
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,250
CSS generally but we also have a bunch

302
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,260
of grunt based tooling you get generated

303
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,320
style guides which Christopher show you

304
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,540
sample apps starter apps we have a PSD

305
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,790
for prototyping we also have a whole

306
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,440
bunch of SVG icons which are pretty

307
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
sweet that came out of Adobe and two

308
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,670
fonts which will probably grow given the

309
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,750
type kit thing

310
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,090
so there's no j/s yet but that's not to

311
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,500
say there won't be jeaious at some point

312
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
in the future we're really not stoked on

313
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,000
the idea of creating a JavaScript

314
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,230
framework but there is some that

315
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,150
the web just does not do properly yet

316
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,620
like touch events that we may want to

317
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,140
polyfill for controls but we don't tell

318
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,400
you how to do templating we don't tell

319
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,570
you how to build your framework we're

320
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,590
not going to we're not going to touch

321
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,720
any of that because there's no right or

322
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,020
wrong way so top codes being released on

323
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,520
the same match already strained at

324
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,500
phonegap and Apache Cordova follow so

325
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,300
it's released every month not a release

326
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,090
every six months and it falls major

327
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,770
minor patch you can check out our

328
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,170
backlog on github it's actually kind of

329
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,690
sweet we using a thing called Hugh board

330
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,960
which I had never heard of but i like it

331
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:23,490
i know the wifis hosed oh wait no its

332
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,160
back sweep so I just scroll down a

333
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,460
little bit off top coat you can go check

334
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,400
out our backlog this Hugh board things

335
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,780
pretty sweet as you can see we've got a

336
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,339
lot coming down the pipeline and we have

337
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,710
a lot of ideas on what we'd like to see

338
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,270
happens if you want to check that out

339
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,970
please go ahead filing issues is

340
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:52,070
contributing yeah release train

341
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,830
empirical to see I driven you got that

342
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,750
platform support I originally was going

343
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,339
to put like a bunch of browsers with

344
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,540
their numbers on them but browsers

345
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,220
update every six weeks and I don't feel

346
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,220
like updating slides every six weeks so

347
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,730
whatever modern browsers you get it

348
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,020
there's three ways to use topcoat you

349
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,790
can use it the same ways bootstrap today

350
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,010
by including everything don't recommend

351
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,680
doing that for production there's an ala

352
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,540
carte way of building it right now which

353
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,310
will show you it's super easy uses a

354
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,900
package.json you can choose which

355
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,940
controls you want which aesthetic you

356
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,740
want and which platforms you want to

357
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,380
support and as a bonus you get a style

358
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,390
guide as you're building it oh and

359
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,830
theming steaming is kind of different

360
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,240
this is something that's totally up for

361
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,020
debate we agonized about baking themes

362
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,600
something off the each control

363
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,310
themselves but we're putting themes into

364
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,500
its own singular git repo right now for

365
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,480
the moment

366
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,860
and we don't know if this is completely

367
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,240
correct or not but essentially you would

368
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,820
fork top coat / theme there's a bunch of

369
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,120
variable files in here some of them are

370
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,329
kind of gross they're not bad to give

371
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,920
you an idea you would give it a theme

372
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,779
dash whatever and it will create that

373
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:05,149
theme for this one good example oh yeah

374
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,070
we're using stylus also we're not

375
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,540
totally locked into that but we think

376
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,850
it's you know better than some of the

377
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,260
alternatives and we wanted to be no D

378
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,889
about things yeah so you would just fork

379
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,570
this you'd modify the variables and

380
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,079
you'd have your own theme current status

381
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,329
it's we just did a point 3 release we're

382
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:24,980
going to do a point for probably any day

383
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,500
now people are building apps already

384
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,779
using top coat today it's only going to

385
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,490
get better in the future as we add more

386
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,639
more more controls there are some

387
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,620
concerns that remain so the first thing

388
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,029
people have been asking us if you go to

389
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,389
the top coat home page you'll see that

390
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:43,399
we're treating desktop and mobile is

391
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,649
separate which is making responsive

392
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,829
design people mad at us and I think it's

393
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:51,230
it's a valid thing to like strive for

394
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,240
responsive design but I also don't think

395
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,500
that it's something that has been fully

396
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,139
solved with the technology we have today

397
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,519
responsive design boils down to the idea

398
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,529
of media queries and match media and the

399
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:03,170
JavaScript side of things and when you

400
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,149
want to do it you have a whole bunch of

401
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:06,800
CSS and then you can you have to

402
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,329
download all that CSS and then you

403
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:09,740
basically conditionally will decide

404
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,970
which stuff you're going to show when

405
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,699
this is really inefficient especially as

406
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:15,529
we have tons and tons of devices out

407
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,630
there if you're downloading all the

408
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,019
desktop CSS to your phone on an edge

409
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,810
connection just a load a small subset of

410
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,120
it you're taking a huge network penalty

411
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,589
but you're also taking a big penalty to

412
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,750
the heap when it's trying to parse all

413
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,600
this CSS so we're treating these are

414
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,339
separate problems I think a lot of these

415
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,319
controls will actually will become

416
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:38,630
responsive as it were and they'll be all

417
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,329
in one thing but for the moment we're

418
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:42,829
not convinced and I don't think the

419
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,540
technology is completely there either so

420
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,490
we're going to again be empirical about

421
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,050
it and approach it discreetly we're

422
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,140
using stylus some people like that some

423
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,630
people don't but you're not using stylus

424
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,250
contributing to top coat is

425
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,450
different than consuming it you're

426
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,790
consuming CSS that's the abstraction

427
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,800
layer you're at if you don't like

428
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,040
stylist that's cool tell us what you do

429
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,780
I guess and there's complexity

430
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,220
trade-offs in our approach we have lots

431
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,870
of git repos which means that we have

432
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,180
lots of versions of things i think this

433
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,920
complexity is worth the trade-off when

434
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,209
you start architecting a larger

435
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:19,339
application but that's that's definitely

436
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,910
up for debate too there's definitely

437
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,189
risks so first thing that to address is

438
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:26,480
that we're not trying to build flex

439
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,880
again at Adobe in fact we want to create

440
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,920
a much larger community around the idea

441
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,720
of open web stuff and we want to fix the

442
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,460
performance characteristics we see built

443
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,710
in apps today this isn't a framework

444
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,780
code sizing quality is kind of the thing

445
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,640
that we're most concerned about so we

446
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,990
have to stay on top of ourselves with

447
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,010
that but that's what the CI

448
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,530
infrastructures for and for operation

449
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,300
with other JavaScript frameworks is also

450
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,920
a huge thing that we want to make sure

451
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,080
is is first class so we're talking to

452
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,600
the Ember guys we told the backbone guys

453
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,590
they don't care and the angular guys so

454
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,610
there's going to be bindings for all

455
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,960
these JavaScript frameworks so they

456
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,420
interoperate and our idea is that if you

457
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,790
know whatever way you build an app will

458
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,340
work with you I bring up revenue drivers

459
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,840
because people a store like well is it

460
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,250
Dobie just going to do this thing and

461
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,140
then abandon it and the answer is no

462
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,600
there is a big internal win for us to

463
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,310
have reused at Adobe but there's also a

464
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,140
larger win when we see our tooling start

465
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,670
adopting this stuff and treating it as a

466
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,800
first class citizen you could imagine

467
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,660
the benchmarking data we're doing could

468
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,950
become available in the tool like

469
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,250
brackets in the future which is a huge

470
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,800
opportunity so we should be shipping

471
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,110
point for I guess in the next day or

472
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:38,990
else I'm a liar and point five coming in

473
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,700
june and then july i think we're going

474
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,950
to ship one for phonegap day there's a

475
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,440
ton of stuff in our roadmap I won't go

476
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,450
through all of these because you can

477
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,340
read I'll just highlight one of them

478
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,620
it's called turbo mode we think we found

479
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,010
a way to make CSS even faster still if

480
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,630
you're curious about that ask me later

481
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,530
what what the hell is turbo mode and we

482
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,330
have all the common sort of community

483
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,860
touch points github is probably the best

484
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,950
place to go but topco do we want to see

485
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,840
the web be a first-class deb platform by

486
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,670
building apps that are fast by default

487
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,440
instead of one

488
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,659
is that are slow in order for us to do

489
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,419
that we need your help and you can find

490
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,309
out more at Topkapi oh we're going to

491
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:20,950
demo it for you now I guess you want to

492
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,369
use your machine or mine okay

493
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:29,259
Christopher's got the latest bits he's

494
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:31,990
going to build an app really quickly and

495
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,259
then I'll pull that down from github and

496
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,149
I'll build it into phonegap and then we

497
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:51,660
can go get pool beers

498
00:19:51,670 --> 00:20:03,370
nice

499
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:08,820
okay let me just yell at me I've been

500
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,860
talked about I'm in the top coat

501
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:19,680
directory um yeah and so let's show show

502
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,730
you what we're doing here so i have this

503
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,590
package.json file and we're actually

504
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,750
thinking about moving the top coat part

505
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,370
out into its own Jason file let us know

506
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,900
what you think about that oh you didn't

507
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,270
mention that the Google mailing list we

508
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,920
should probably yeah we're going to

509
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,210
start posted we're going to be posting

510
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,130
all these ideas and considerations on

511
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,390
the Google mailing list so people can

512
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,070
tell us how down we are in chollas to

513
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,790
death we've seen other people so there's

514
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,120
like component and Bauer are having a

515
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,130
cat fight over who gets to own component

516
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,840
JSON and we didn't really want to get

517
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,370
involved and then we're like well

518
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,680
everyone has a package.json now we'll

519
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,630
just put it under a top coat global

520
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,920
seems like a fairly okay thing to do

521
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,180
because there's that file there already

522
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,550
we already have like license notice get

523
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,910
ignore package.json grunt file we didn't

524
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,750
really want to add another one

525
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,270
necessarily so well I don't know yeah I

526
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,490
mean and also we got burned pretty bad

527
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,230
when we switched from the adobe order to

528
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,840
taco org and Bauer can unregister us so

529
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,240
we actually couldn't push our bits up so

530
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,740
we had to go with this which I actually

531
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,080
am pretty happy with as Brian talked

532
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,820
about these are corresponding these

533
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,980
skins are corresponding to github repos

534
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,360
so let's just talk about / button if you

535
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,490
had your own button to be your username

536
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,860
/ button these numbers these version

537
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,360
numbers are actually the tag versions of

538
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,970
the components and of the github repo so

539
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,620
we actually have support for night least

540
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,940
by just removing the tag number and then

541
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,800
you can get a nightly version of the

542
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,000
component so if you're doing development

543
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,800
time you could actually see that so this

544
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,940
is the list of components I'm going to

545
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,630
build right so I just run grunt and my

546
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,120
five should work goes down pulls down

547
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,910
all those tag versions with zips

548
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,840
obviously if I have a nightly would just

549
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,390
do a shallow clone instead puts it into

550
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,510
the right place runs a compile step

551
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,960
using stylus and I've done the same kind

552
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,150
of stuff that you would want to write

553
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,280
like I've sequestered the brain damage

554
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,230
of compile into it

555
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,690
task so if we wasn't were to switch to a

556
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,610
like rework or something we could just

557
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,049
switch that one file and everything

558
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:17,000
would work the same fewer if you really

559
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,320
wanted to do sass like I saw someone

560
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,390
fork topcoat removed all the modularity

561
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,790
and started putting sass in as get sub

562
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,990
modules would have been much easier just

563
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,450
to change the compile task to use sass

564
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,860
instead of stylist and that's why I

565
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,160
built that way we totally want to work

566
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,169
with these like open package managers

567
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:34,549
and stuff but we think the space is like

568
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:36,919
immature and broken so we're just using

569
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:38,390
grunt because we're pretty sure you are

570
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,970
too but I'm like fully open to like

571
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,350
trying to figure out a better way to do

572
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,840
this there's that new initiative from

573
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,130
google that used to be called tool

574
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,429
kitchen with a polymer polymer so like I

575
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:50,990
think the features web components but I

576
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,370
don't think the future is here yet and

577
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,740
so we're just sticking to JavaScript and

578
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,440
CSS as the Ross for impossible until

579
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,350
such time as the tools are better right

580
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,940
so this is we're using style delco right

581
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,130
now for generated style guides give us

582
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,540
feedback on that we actually have

583
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,059
another version that looks more like our

584
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:10,100
designer generated style guides that we

585
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,990
can switch to but this tends to have all

586
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,669
the features that you could possibly

587
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:15,410
have rights of the kitchen sink of style

588
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,450
guide features so people wanted to vote

589
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,590
on which ones they wanted to keep it

590
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,059
basically will show you all of the

591
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,230
components that I had in that

592
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,120
package.json already compiled it with

593
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,440
use examples so you can just copy and

594
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,190
paste so you go down here you know lists

595
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,620
nav header nav bar and actually has a

596
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,270
working button as an example and then

597
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,100
you know we talked about responsive and

598
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,860
like this header is responsive if right

599
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,870
but it's not made in the responsive way

600
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,429
doesn't use media queries it's actually

601
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:42,140
just a percentage-based header you could

602
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,320
use it that way this is kind of a nice

603
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,900
whoa sorry I think like a super nice

604
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,690
feature because if you saw Nicole's

605
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,630
presentation if you don't have a living

606
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,400
style guide then you probably have a

607
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,140
static one and you end up with 50

608
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,780
buttons that look the same copy paste

609
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,750
CSS so our hope is that people use this

610
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,570
tool to build out their apps it'll jump

611
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,669
into this generated style guide and then

612
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:09,020
they will copy and paste but they'll be

613
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,790
copy and pasting from something more

614
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,750
canonical and managed right

615
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,470
so oh that's it so basically if you

616
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,030
follow the readme it just you just

617
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:23,440
include whichever version of the style

618
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,970
guide CSS CSS team that you want just

619
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,380
you thinking like CSS because it's just

620
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,750
CSS and then you just copy and paste

621
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,810
from from here the uses these guys and I

622
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,420
I encourage people to play with these

623
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,100
like you know leave something out of the

624
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,570
list or leave something out of the

625
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,890
header and see what it does we're

626
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,050
separating things like layout if you

627
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,330
look it's like layout and positioning

628
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,770
you know this is I have these really

629
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,050
dumb layout classes like quarter half

630
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,150
full but I'm totally intending people to

631
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,350
use their own grid system or their own

632
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,540
layout classes for the elements and then

633
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,860
I also want to see what people use so

634
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,090
that I can actually build those things

635
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,620
in or make it support those things

636
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,510
better we have our own grid system but I

637
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,920
don't want to impose that on anyone so

638
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,650
we separate all the concerns so I went

639
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,660
and did a really quick and dirty example

640
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,910
using topcoat and I just all I did was I

641
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,500
went in length of CSS and then copy and

642
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,200
pasted the styles and then I added

643
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,060
really minimal JavaScript just for the

644
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,340
click handler and added some we're going

645
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,990
to separate transitions too so we'll

646
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,450
have a whole set of transitions under

647
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,520
top coat that just use CSS animations

648
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,860
actually we're both super interested in

649
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,930
if you have opinions about this one we

650
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,630
don't really have an answer but is slide

651
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,680
left component may be right I'm not

652
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,650
totally sure and what I am sure of is

653
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,360
when you look into backbone apps very

654
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,310
often you will see a shitload of visual

655
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,050
display logic or will be like sliding

656
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,510
things left and right or whatever and I

657
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,830
don't know if your controller should

658
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,240
know that right like I think your

659
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,590
controller should know about the state

660
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,060
of the models that are around like it

661
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,530
should know that you know i'm showing

662
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,030
users right now but should it know that

663
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,130
the users came in from the bottom no no

664
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,110
if it should and that's kind of the nice

665
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,940
thing about CSS is very declarative and

666
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,800
you keep that presentation business out

667
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,650
of your controllers so talk to us about

668
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,360
that right so we're trying to separate

669
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,200
concerns in the way that we're

670
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,430
approaching people saying so I actually

671
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,620
got a bug an issue request saying hey

672
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,750
you should have a slide-out menu

673
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,240
component and I said to that I'm like

674
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,170
well the way that we're handling those

675
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,130
requests is we're actually to make

676
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,570
examples right we're going to make

677
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,950
examples in composing these different

678
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,240
patterns and then give you all the

679
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,320
pieces and you can compose

680
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,550
I figure you could come up with

681
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,660
something way more creative than the

682
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,100
slide menu if you had all the pieces and

683
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,450
you could put them together like legos

684
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,640
right so that's that I push this up to

685
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,260
github again it was just quick and dirty

686
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,590
this morning like trying to get this

687
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,830
working so that we could dental it no

688
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,090
all right so let's see if we can

689
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,640
phonegap it ya doin out here yeah I'll

690
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:53,800
swap with you so oh yeah i confuse me

691
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:08,420
hit you what's up

692
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:15,610
ok cool uh so I downloaded a fresh build

693
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,210
a phonegap 2.7 2.8 should be coming out

694
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:24,940
today Steve here is it coming out today

695
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,960
or what all right good enough I'm not

696
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,320
I'm not hating Steve so when you

697
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,300
download phonegap you get a Lib

698
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,140
directory and well inside of there

699
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,110
there's a bunch of mobile platforms in

700
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,550
the future we're going to have a CLI

701
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,990
tool it wraps all this up so you don't

702
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,460
have to look at these guts but you'll

703
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,870
always have these guts available to you

704
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:57,220
and I'm going to go iOS then create we

705
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,260
have these command line tools the normal

706
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,850
lines all the weird at different

707
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,030
platforms do and one of them is create

708
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,770
and so I'm going to create a project on

709
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,130
my desktop I'm going to call it I don't

710
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:16,120
know Jess calm whoa top coat I owed up

711
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:24,150
Brian Jess comp just call top coat oops

712
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,530
so that's going to generate a native

713
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,620
project on my desktop called jazz comp

714
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,720
top coat here it is right here this is

715
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,640
just an iOS project and it's got ww

716
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,530
folder so let's let's quickly build that

717
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,020
to make sure that I didn't break the

718
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:50,110
world

719
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,560
so we have these command line tools like

720
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,420
Cordova run which is consistent across

721
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,180
platforms creating projects logging

722
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,640
emulating building whatever so if you're

723
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,980
working inside of iOS you can just which

724
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,460
context to Android with with out too

725
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,430
much trouble so that should it worked

726
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,590
and it did there's an app that we built

727
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,200
that's exciting so I'm going to open

728
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,590
this directory up and I'm just going to

729
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,680
delete everything except for that

730
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,480
Cordova JS file and I think I pulled

731
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:38,100
down your uh oh okay I'm gonna jump onto

732
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,020
my desktop git clone I don't remember

733
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:51,900
it's like github / Krista I did it did

734
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,650
it got your name right okay so you

735
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:03,800
already had a that's fine yeah well

736
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,980
I don't know never seen it do that

737
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,540
before what's up of that oh the line

738
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:19,910
wrapping that's cool that's it's all

739
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,250
it's all of our splash screens it's our

740
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,430
overzealous designer 15 Meg splash

741
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:36,680
screen I wish I was joking I'm not it's

742
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,210
got a sweet gradient though so where is

743
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:46,160
that topcoat phonegap just give a copy

744
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:52,160
and paste that mess to desktop j/s off

745
00:30:52,160 --> 00:31:00,410
top coat ww place all this stuff across

746
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:10,090
our fingers

747
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:20,870
we recompile did it I have to kill the

748
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,660
simulator first I'm also running the

749
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,860
android sdk on a mac air so that always

750
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:46,419
works out well let's try this again

751
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:51,629
there we go ah ah bad cash hold on all

752
00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:56,119
right this is a native dev demo God's

753
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:59,580
combo of Awesome so sometimes you got to

754
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,259
go into Xcode and and the running joke

755
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:06,450
is that don't worry about Xcode it's

756
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,279
just like eclipse it's if it looks like

757
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:17,580
itunes and eid like a building clean

758
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,340
 is that actually this might just

759
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:29,789
is that actually this might just
work

760
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:36,940
come on xcode get your together

761
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:42,540
it is launching

762
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:50,260
right oh wait whoa I went into an ipad I

763
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:55,960
guess yay there's our native mobile

764
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,210
operating on an iPad so I guess we could

765
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,120
improve this by doing this in a iOS

766
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,770
context let's just quickly do this

767
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:06,070
enough handset so you could media query

768
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,450
this up all you want we're not going to

769
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,760
tell you how to build your app because

770
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:23,120
people people that do suck there we go

771
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:27,640
um listen that was the Android one yeah

772
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,160
they have one hey you are you talking to

773
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,000
you buddy there we go Alex looks good

774
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,360
though right there you go and we don't

775
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,890
have an hour so we're not going to show

776
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:46,419
you android

777
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:49,639
so yeah top coat it's thing we need your

778
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:52,389
help check out top coat do tweet at us

779
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:55,039
and let us know the types of stuff

780
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,080
you're looking for for phonegap we're

781
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,759
hoping to start pre-loading with lots of

782
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,470
example apps so that building apps

783
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,029
across platforms that look good by

784
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:04,629
default and they're fast our thing

785
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:17,569
thanks and questions yes yeah

786
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,440
yeah we're into Bauer soon as they

787
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,000
closed a few bugs will totally do that

788
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,409
we've liked them and component and all

789
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:27,879
these different client-side package

790
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:32,020
managers are almost there they're just

791
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,480
not quite there in the particular case

792
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,300
for Bauer we did publish there and then

793
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,980
we changed repo names and they have a

794
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,869
bug where we can't change repo names and

795
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:56,820
so yeah yep

796
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:01,990
yeah well yeah it's open source now

797
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,250
telemetry is a little tricky to get at

798
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,290
today you have to do your own compile a

799
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,080
custom build of CEF which isn't as bad

800
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,020
as it sounds but at the future the idea

801
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,670
would be this tooling is fully automated

802
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,620
on an app per app level so that you as a

803
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,810
developer would get notified that hey

804
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,180
you just made slower when you

805
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,100
change something oh I should repeat your

806
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,320
question the question was are we going

807
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,790
to expose topcoats benchmarking

808
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,950
facilities to the public it already is

809
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,130
it's a top coat the github / top coat /

810
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,330
top coat dash server it's weird like I'm

811
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,830
umbilical to you so we're doing at a at

812
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,450
a component level right now but then

813
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,830
we're going to work on like you said at

814
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,610
am at a page like a whole app level as

815
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,230
well right we're just we just haven't

816
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,130
gotten to that part because we've only

817
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,320
been working on it for a couple months

818
00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:08,480
any other questions oh yeah well so at

819
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,700
the moment we just give you CSS and oh

820
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,680
the question is we have desktop and we

821
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,410
have mobile and you know how what do we

822
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,730
recommend you know how do you know when

823
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,310
to use which we're right now just giving

824
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,800
you the CSS flat-out we're leaving it up

825
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,690
to you to decide how to architect your

826
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,300
app I'm hoping in the future like we're

827
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,500
going to be doing lots of experiments

828
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,530
around responsive style designs to to

829
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,600
see for ourselves for right now the

830
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,950
state where at is we're actually just

831
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,410
building a bunch of apps we don't want

832
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,120
to get to enterprise architect on this

833
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,500
and tell people that the right way

834
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,840
before we've actually you know used it

835
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:53,370
so that's our that's our approach yep

836
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,260
are we creating replacements for the

837
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:02,410
native like controls yep those are all

838
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,400
coming so we're taking big lists we

839
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,920
actually did a ton of design research

840
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,800
around what apps are using and what

841
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,320
types of controls they need and selects

842
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,190
and all that stuff is coming for sure

843
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,310
like really soon yeah the design

844
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,140
research is all available yeah actually

845
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,380
oh man pub like a plan it's it's under

846
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:37,270
top yeah yeah it's at 404 no I did he

847
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,510
really find it it's in there it's under

848
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,240
the there's also some in our wiki yeah

849
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,890
I'm actually the design research was

850
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,390
really interesting if you've got to if

851
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,350
you were lucky enough to get to go to

852
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,190
CSS comp we we had the design manager

853
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,590
walk through it all

854
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:59,230
dawn yeah recommendation is to know I

855
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,530
was really close oh we're just muttering

856
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,360
to ourselves right now there's been

857
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,700
absolutely no content in the last minute

858
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,400
don't worry just trying to find where

859
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,950
the design research is a kind of a

860
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,390
really awesome benefit of being at

861
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,250
adobe's that we have a lot of badass XD

862
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,350
people that really love nerding out on

863
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,510
this and so they did a ton of research

864
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,310
into how could we create something

865
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,550
that's visually clean easily style and

866
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,190
we'll come on come off as fast when it

867
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,740
gets implemented all that research is

868
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:36,580
open source to were like you said we're

869
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,590
redoing the website right now to make to

870
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,510
expose the research documentation as

871
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:48,730
well yeah any other questions oh no no

872
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:59,560
other questions oh yes Remy ah ok I'll

873
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,090
talk a little bit about sort so Remy's

874
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,590
asking what's turbo mode it's something

875
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,670
that we're looking at bringing in the

876
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,900
future it's an idea extracted from femo

877
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,650
us these guys created a crazy demo where

878
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,360
they have this amazing sphere that's

879
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,120
moving around like lightning speeds and

880
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,470
if you look at their source the way they

881
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,780
did this was by avoiding the render

882
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,880
pipeline in WebKit and the way they do

883
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,510
that is by setting style attribute on

884
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,570
every single element in the Dom using a

885
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,340
physics engine to programmatically

886
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,500
position everything in a 3d space using

887
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,840
a matrix-matrix transform so if it

888
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,410
sounds gross it is but it's also super

889
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,870
fast and so we think we can apply this

890
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,550
technique in the top coat to do like

891
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,800
really crazy transitions like super high

892
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,480
speeds it's only going to work in WebKit

893
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,900
but yeah that's what turbo mode will be

894
00:39:50,910 --> 00:40:00,280
famous yeah wiki 40 49 typing on a match

895
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,619
killing me I was trying to show there's

896
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:06,260
a bunch of slides from eat top coat and

897
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,270
it's not working I'll put those up in a

898
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,560
way that you can't do a bit you can

899
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,100
actually step through there's some slide

900
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,180
there's some slides you can step through

901
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,800
and actually shows step by step of

902
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,980
research process alright thanks

903
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:33,100
everybody
