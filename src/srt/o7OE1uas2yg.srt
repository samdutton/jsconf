18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,090
Crockford on there anyway I'm doing

19
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,299
about it the thing is I actually if you

semicolon haters it'll solve all of your

23
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:40,180
problems there's one catch but

24
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:46,920
HTML had Hamill and CSS hats s but

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,440
jeaious had just yes that

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,610
now CoffeeScript has brothers at ur

27
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,659
style of its own but there's just one

28
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:20,310
little problem when and every stroke a

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,730
it's enough to make mistake with

30
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:39,470
JavaScript source maps land-uses really

31
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,950
yeah

32
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,480
kind of awesome you should really check

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,470
it out but I already know CoffeeScript

34
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,520
you know you already know yeah I did not

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,200
I didn't know what do you use it to use

36
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,120
it for your your own development I do

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,440
but all the good names were taking but I

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,320
think what did you so you you wrote like

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,520
a templating library let me guess yeah

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,050
there's like a thousand of those I know

41
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,060
so how did you I mean how did you find a

42
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,230
name for that I don't even know I mean

43
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,700

using node a yes you can use it in

50
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,929
protective bundles

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:43,819
just the clarity is awesome and I'm kind

55
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:44,930
of in the market for a temp let me

56
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,549
measure myself because I'm developing

57
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:52,700
this new new iPhone app Oh objective-c

58
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,950
oh no no no I didn't learn objective-c

59
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,420
yeah you actually don't actually need

60
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,389
technically to learn objective-c yeah no

61
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,730
I had a little something myself I cooked

62
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:10,400
up if you're shipping iOS and dream of

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,739
the box you'll make you think about

64
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,849
going native but X goes the big headache

65
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:18,590
think of things like foam yeah or

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,289
whatever it's called this week it helps

67
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,050

68
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,250
to speak Objective C C Objective C

69
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,130
Objective C don't need that crap or get

70
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,060

Wow Foam capsules really useful Thanks

75
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,850
pretty awesome you just the thing is I

76
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,650
mean you think like oh just use PhoneGap

77
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,880
and we'll solve my problems but it's

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,590
actually it's kind of actually not that

79
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,780

80
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:10,230
I'll tell you about it right now

81
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:22,560

82
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:29,210
you think es5 makes you feel alive so

83
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:37,360

yeah it was it really hard to ship yeah

89
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:11,550
you know it's web apps are just

90
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,380
complicated with JavaScript you have to

91
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,559
send all this JavaScript over the wire

92
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:25,229
because you know what do you what are

93
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:53,130

101
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,020

102
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,139
things and I don't know it's just so

103
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,699
overwhelming sometimes seems to kind of

104
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:23,370
get down but I think there's hope

105
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:30,100
it's 2012 and still we are Holi filling

106
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,110
