00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,740
hi hello everybody my name is Stefan

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,750
Aguilar I'm fronting developer an

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,500
illustrator

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,020
I'm from made in Colombia and this is my

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,050
first time in Berlin I love training and

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,730
learning new information about

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,710
technology and the Colombian tech

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,570
communities have been a source of

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,300
inspiration for me

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,820
in Colombia we have about 19 tech

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,980
communities providing spaces for

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,309
innovation and collaborative learning

14
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:40,260
imagine I'm one of three leaders of

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,320
maize in CSS community the first and

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,190
only CSS community in my country a

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,680
community with more than 1,000 members a

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,230
community that creates positive change

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,070
and educates for the future today I'm

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,770
going to talk about CSS logical

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,520
properties in CSS we have a lot of

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,049
keywords to describe physical positions

23
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,720
such as left right top and bottom let's

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,390
take this image for example if we want

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,580
to move an element of the screen we will

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,890
use a container with a relative position

27
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,710
the element with absolute position top

28
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,670
50 pixels and right 50 50 pixels but of

29
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,400
course moving an element is not the only

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,009
thing that we want to do we also need to

31
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,110
work with other physical properties such

32
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,900
as margin top bar the bottom padding

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,960
left these properties come naturally if

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,270
we are working in an English grading

35
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,420
system for us they are written in a web

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,119
page is top left because we graph from

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,390
left to right but have you ever thought

38
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,390
how our layout will look in a different

39
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,799
rating system in a different alphabet

40
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,159
for example in Arabic Hebrew and Persian

41
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,649
vague right from right to left and the

42
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,829
origin of the screen is top right so

43
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,380
what you will see on the left side on

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,929
the English reading mode you will see on

45
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,550
the right side in an

46
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,450
Hebrew impatient grading systems

47
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,920
consequently working with physical

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,020
properties can become a problem if we

49
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,120
want our layout to work in many

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,600
languages I just mentioned the words

51
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,000
grading modes but I want us to look at

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,670
how these specification works and what

53
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,050
we can gain from it

54
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,540
these riding modes can help us better

55
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,410
understand CSS green flexbox and the

56
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,510
work involved in creating a web page in

57
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,800
a new language the gradient mode affect

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,020
both the organization and election

59
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,050
allottee in our web page so the grading

60
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,660
note is the first building block of its

61
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,200
design that we create CSS is able to

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,060
support many different international

63
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,000
grading systems systems that rise from

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,420
left to right such as the latins this is

65
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,640
the most commonly used writing systems

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,190
around the world with more than two

67
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,240
thousands 500 million users systems

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,730
derived from left to right such as the

69
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,400
Arabic grading systems this is the

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,440
second most commonly used writing

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,290
systems around the world it is used in

72
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,270
many languages around the Middle East

73
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,590
Asia and Africa systems that are

74
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,230
bi-directional these are a combination

75
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,300
of Latins and Arabic alphabets systems

76
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,750
that are verticals such as Asian

77
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,530
characters because CSS support all these

78
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,320
many languages there are five possible

79
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,880
career mode options horizonte tbéamé

80
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,590
vertical l are vertical RL sideways l r

81
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,530
and sideways r l agrarian mode in CSS is

82
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,620
determined by the properties of reading

83
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,550
mode direction and text orientation it

84
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,850
is mainly defined in terms of block flow

85
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,030
direction and in line based direction so

86
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,600
let's look Iranian CSS words if you have

87
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,700
work with CSS before you might be

88
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,800
familiar with display:block and

89
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,940
displaying

90
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,220
if we are in a default grading mode we

91
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,470
will see that by using display:block all

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,350
the elements are placed very curly from

93
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,270
the top of the page to the bottom

94
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,080
but if we use display:inline we will see

95
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,310
that the elements are placed

96
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,060
side-by-side from left to right this is

97
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,910
the align base duration within the case

98
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:52,030
how we read read and write but block and

99
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,610
align concepts will help us understand

100
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,180
CSS logical properties ahead let's take

101
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,550
a look at some examples for different

102
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,090
values rally mode horizontal tbh

103
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,470
horizontal T beam is the initial value

104
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,300
the text is displayed from left to right

105
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,979
we have locked row direction from top to

106
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:15,669
bottom

107
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:18,220
both the grading mode and the typography

108
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,610
mode are horizontal reading mode

109
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,150
Berrocal are L the text is displayed

110
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,120
from top to bottom with a block flow

111
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,389
direction from right to left

112
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,830
both the grading mode and the

113
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,760
typographies mode are very cool reading

114
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,090
mode very kal-el are the text is

115
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,970
displayed from top to bottom with a

116
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,250
block flow direction from left to right

117
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,979
both the grading mode and the typography

118
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:53,380
mode are vertical running mode sideways

119
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,669
L ll the text is displayed from top to

120
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,370
bottom with a block flow direction from

121
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,650
right to left the grading mode is

122
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,310
vertical

123
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,530
but the typography mode and the symbols

124
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,889
are placed on the right side running

125
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:12,580
mode sideways L are the text is

126
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,250
displayed from bottom to top with a

127
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,620
block flow direction from left to right

128
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,169
the growing mode is vertical but a

129
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:22,870
typography mode and symbols are placed

130
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,310
on the left side is important to

131
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,860
consider the compatibility between

132
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,159
running mode and browsers in this table

133
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,680
from Cana use we can see which browsers

134
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,470
are compact

135
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,590
malinka remote property everything shown

136
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,350
in green is the support of Belgium but

137
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,770
in some versions of Chrome Safari and

138
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,880
opera the color red indicates it is not

139
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,700
super yet another consideration is that

140
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,450
some versions in a peck fix like WebKit

141
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,320
or MS to be able to use running mode

142
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,260
properly and you can look up here in

143
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,520
disappearing huh where it says lowell in

144
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,300
May

145
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,520
2019 is 19 7.16 percent that's great

146
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,080
another important property of Reading

147
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,810
Mode is direction the election property

148
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,900
defines how inline content such as the

149
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,120
characters in a paragraph the paragraph

150
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,680
flow on the screen

151
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,510
it can have two values left to right is

152
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,570
the first one and the other one is right

153
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,580
to left

154
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,669
CSS logical properties automatically map

155
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,370
layouts to a constant Direction cell

156
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,320
with the direction and the gray very

157
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,900
mode a properties before we use physical

158
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,830
position to be layout but more recently

159
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,470
we have started using a new approach to

160
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,840
building layout flexbox

161
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,930
and CSS grid let's take a deeper look

162
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,030
into flexbox and the logic involved

163
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,260
flexbox doesn't take into account

164
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,680
physical dimensions such as left right

165
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,160
top and bottom it uses values like flex

166
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,490
estar and flex and these values rely on

167
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,160
the direction of the main and cross axis

168
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,919
which we using flexbox this is better

169
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:28,190
because concept like start and L are up

170
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,490
in are relative in Flex box and can be

171
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,710
easily flipped

172
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,900
here we have an example of flex box in

173
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,630
action the first thing that you need to

174
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,479
do to create this example is define the

175
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,410
container we display flex by default all

176
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,839
the elements are placed side by side

177
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,279
from left to right

178
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,829
if we need the elements to be placed

179
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:53,899
very column we need to add another

180
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,680
property to the container flex direction

181
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,740
we need to keep in mind that flex box is

182
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,829
a single direction layout concept that

183
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:06,589
is the elements can be placed in

184
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,339
oriental rose or vertical columns for

185
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,699
this reason flex Direction has four

186
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:18,680
different values row row is the default

187
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,019
value and depends of the direction of

188
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,920
the under reading mode property if you

189
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,250
are in an LTR direction you can see that

190
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,680
the elements are placed side by side

191
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,290
from left right but if you are in an LTI

192
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,939
direction you can see the elements are

193
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:42,920
placed from right to left row rivers is

194
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,519
the same concept like rows but in this

195
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,790
case if you are in an LTR direction you

196
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,949
can see the elements are placed side by

197
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:56,449
side from right to left and if you are

198
00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:59,329
in an RTL direction you can see the

199
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,910
elements are placed side by side from

200
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,500
left to right column is the same concept

201
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,350
like row but in this case the elements

202
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,649
are placed top to bottom and culinary

203
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,170
wealth is the same that row reverse but

204
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,100
in this case the elements are placed to

205
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,699
bottom to top with only these two

206
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:25,040
properties display flex and flex

207
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,439
direction we can see the magic in this

208
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:35,300
example and when the bottoms change to

209
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,579
the values of the growing mode property

210
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,449
in horizontal tea be very kal-el are and

211
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:45,110
vertical are in flexbox the behavior of

212
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,720
their lives depend of the flex direction

213
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,930
property for example justified content

214
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,439
along the elements horizontally if flex

215
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:57,769
direction is row or Rory where's mark

216
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:00,459
vertically if the flow direction is

217
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,149
column or curl

218
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:02,690
column

219
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,240
reverse this is the real beauty of

220
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,150
flexbox and this is the beginning of the

221
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,050
logic concepts in our layout Joseph I

222
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,320
content property can be take five values

223
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,120
flex start flex and center is space

224
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,540
between and space around but let's focus

225
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,570
on the first two flex start and flicks

226
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,780
it in this expect in this example you

227
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,510
can see that the start and end concepts

228
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,400
change dependent of the gradient mode

229
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,770
problem after flexbox the most powerful

230
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,780
layout systems appear CSS grid CSS grid

231
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,810
is a two dimensional system created

232
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,600
specifically to solve the layouts

233
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,020
problem we have been hacking from a long

234
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,640
time CSS grid doesn't know left right

235
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,920
top and bottom properties basically CSS

236
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,270
grid flows the same logic ax place books

237
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,340
you can define the position of the green

238
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,880
items with properties such as green rows

239
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,690
are or green called column end similarly

240
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,050
to flexbox CSS grid also has logical

241
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,800
properties instead of physical points

242
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,340
let's take a look at one example to get

243
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,650
started you have defined the container

244
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:36,460
we display grid the elements we also for

245
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,290
coordinate the elements you need the

246
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,810
container define with rip template

247
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,810
columns or greet and paid rows to place

248
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,120
the children into the grid we need to

249
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,240
define each elements with green column

250
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,230
start one green column and two green row

251
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,370
start one and grid row and two or use a

252
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,500
shorthand like write Rho star / M real

253
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:10,550
row start end the way of thinking in CSS

254
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,520
logical properties a very important

255
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,430
thing in CSS is the box model

256
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,910
we use we are used the box model shown

257
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,880
on the left side on the screen this is

258
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,840
not wrong this is still correct but in

259
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,790
but in order to use the CSS logical

260
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,390
property

261
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,480
we must stop thinking in in terms of

262
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,330
left right top and bottom and replace

263
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,780
them with inline star in line and block

264
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,260
start and block end you can see this

265
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,080
change in language shown in the second

266
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,700
box model now we return to this source

267
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,440
property these two concepts blood and

268
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,580
star and in life when we are work with

269
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,830
logical properties we start understand

270
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,640
the block and align axis as we ship to

271
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,920
this way of thinking of our layout

272
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,380
begins to make more sense now

273
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,200
our logical properties will be like the

274
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,470
list shown on the left margins on the

275
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,780
left of this table you can see the name

276
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,450
of the property of the physical property

277
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,230
margin top margin left margin right

278
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,340
margin bottom and in the right side you

279
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,970
can see the equivalent of these a

280
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,670
physical property for example of margin

281
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,160
top the equivalent is margin block star

282
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,160
in a logical problem at the same in

283
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,010
margin right the equivalent is margin in

284
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,480
line end this is an example of margins

285
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,350
in this case I use margin block star

286
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,230
property and we can see how it changed

287
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,340
when running mode property change you

288
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,830
will want to keep your eyes on it on the

289
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,100
space between the first block and the

290
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,460
second block this is the margin block

291
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,080
palette this is the same of margins on

292
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,450
the left side you can see the properties

293
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,810
the physical properties such as padding

294
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,080
top padding left padding right and param

295
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,420
bottom and the right side you can see

296
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,100
the logical property

297
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,320
the Kimmel analogical property so she

298
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,170
has padding block star black Palin

299
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,870
inline star Palin in line and I'm

300
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,610
Pauline block and here there are some

301
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,600
examples for palates again you can see

302
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,030
how Palin's change when they grow in

303
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,540
mode change the container here is

304
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,900
showing their purple and the shy is

305
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,870
representing with them with the border

306
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,970
in color white there are purple

307
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,230
outside of the white dots is the party

308
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,570
borders in this table you can see a

309
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,060
little of the left side the physical

310
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,560
properties this is a little bit complex

311
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,150
because is the border top and you can

312
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:28,160
place the size or style or color and the

313
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,000
same the logical problem the logical

314
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,910
equivalent property is bordered block

315
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,780
star and you can set them size style or

316
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,330
color this example of borders might be a

317
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,910
little more complicated the different

318
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,730
colors of the border shown here will

319
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,490
help you track how they they change

320
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,910
differently with the red border I use

321
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,580
the border in line start preparing for

322
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,610
the purple border I use the border

323
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,390
inline star properly and affect the

324
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:10,699
other block with yellow border I use the

325
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:16,670
border block eight positions on the left

326
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,510
you see the name of the property as use

327
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,780
of the old box model top left right and

328
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,360
bottom and the left side you can see the

329
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,050
logical problem equivalent like instead

330
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,510
block start instead in line start

331
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,660
instead in line and are in safe block

332
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,650
and just like running mode the

333
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,750
compatibility is important

334
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,570
and again some Belgians need a prix fixe

335
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,580
and you can lick you can see and this

336
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:55,429
upper right hand when say global is 19

337
00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:01,640
to dot 49% in conclusion we need to

338
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,100
think in ways of create webpage that

339
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,890
accessible to everyone thinking in terms

340
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,140
or logical properties is a good practice

341
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,929
when creating a webpage with multiple

342
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:17,900
languages but ok I have a little quiz

343
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,039
for you please take out your phone and

351
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,010
see you logical properties the first

the next okay which concepts help us

357
00:22:33,680 --> 00:23:03,080
understand the CSS elements where is the

358
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,120
logical property equivalent to the

359
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,400

whoa what is the logical property

363
00:23:35,160 --> 00:24:02,340
equivalent to the party left I don't

364
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,990
know what is the name of a case the last

365
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,020
question thinking in terms of logical

366
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,610
properties
