00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,700

hello everybody I'm Nicholas Carr 7

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,790
Monta I'm the guy behind the JavaScript

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,240
in for his tool kit and today I'm going

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,650
to be talking about creating interactive

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,090
data visualizations for the web so there

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,619
are too many topics related to the

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,529
project one is data visualization itself

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,920
the other one is JavaScript since I'm

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,420
going to be describing more what the

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,360
toolkit does I'm going to focus more on

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,750
data visualization but you can ask me

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,789
any JavaScript weird question so the

13
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,079
JavaScript them for this toolkit its

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,480
purpose is to create web based

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,030
interactive data visualizations it

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,420
supports charts and multiple graph and

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,379
three layouts it's a modular extensible

18
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,980
and composable and its web standards

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,409
based so by modularity what I mean is

20
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,869
that you can go to the to the page and

21
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,549
you can actually make your own build of

22
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,130
the toolkit so you can keep the code of

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,560
the visualizations you will use and keep

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,479
all the code of the visualizations you

25
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,090
won't be using internally actually the

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,000
toolkit has many independent small

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
modules of functionality that you can

28
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,950
add or remove those are kind of generic

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,570
modules for example you can add total

30
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,900
support or event system with you know

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,659
event delegation or most movement

32
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,900
tracking or you can add remove

33
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,640
navigation panning and zooming or graph

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,130
operations and dissolve work the same

35
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,259
for visualization so you can add or

36
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,110
remove those this is interesting because

37
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,380
you know for the loading time of the

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,620
page then

39
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,780
it is extensible in a way of know the

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,550
mathematical definition of a graph is

41
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,890
that you have a set of notes and set of

42
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,890
relations between notes and there is not

43
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,890
much a more concrete description of what

44
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,370
a node is awarding edges and so I try to

45
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,710
keep that kind of abstraction to let you

46
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,600
you know customize the nodes and edges

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,990
just as you want so basically in this

48
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,640
example we can see different node types

49
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,430
these are built-in types and you can

50
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,430
change different properties like size

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,360
color or any canvas style same goes for

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,120
the edges you know like line with color

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,790
etc or you can hack your own note

54
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,770
rendering functions or edge rendering

55
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,440
functions by augmenting the node types

56
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,710
object and so you could you know use

57
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,560
draw image from canvas or pester video

58
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,870
inside of the canvas or you know etc and

59
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,670
following this idea of extensibility I

60
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,150
thought that it would be quite elegant

61
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,590
for the toolkit to be able to compose

62
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,680
visualizations from other visualizations

63
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,440
so you could add visualizations as node

64
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,270
and edge rendering functions to other

65
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,820
visa actually but you can do it and most

66
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,010
important of all web standards based so

67
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,850
I'm basically using html5 canvas but I'm

68
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,320
also using SVG CSS and JavaScript ie six

69
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,200
to eight is supported via Explorer

70
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,480
canvas or flash canvas which is you know

71
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,400
flash a JavaScript API for canvas in

72
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,209
flash all our browsers are supported

73
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,510
natively there's also a mobile support

74
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,450
for Android and iPhone I'm supporting

75
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,269
touch events and also for example some

76
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,730
versions of iphone do not have

77
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,560
very good Phil text function for the

78
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,349
canvas so you can fall back and just add

79
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:59,530
HTML and svgs labels for the note the

80
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,000
future visualizations are stacked charts

81
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,620
like ariel bar and pie charts you have

82
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,510
space filling visualizations which i'll

83
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,110
be describing later and also know to

84
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,840
link visualizations you have stacked

85
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,419
aria charts everything is you know very

86
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,690
dynamic you can filter and restore your

87
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,180
filters and you can upload the data

88
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,090
alive also by sending another json

89
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,580
object jason data same principle for the

90
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,740
bar charts you can change the

91
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,840
orientation of the bars can also update

92
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,130
the data live sm goes with pie charts

93
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,870
this is kind of a more complex

94
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,669
representation of a pie chart in which

95
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,310
you know each pie slice has different

96
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,880
heights and you are dealing with many

97
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,620
different layers of information which

98
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,660
are aggregated on each file but you

99
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,479
could also just make up I a simple pie

100
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:10,890
charts

101
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,340
so not much to say about charts then you

102
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,110
have space filling visualizations so

103
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,610
watching what our space filling

104
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,970
visualizations so if you take a standard

105
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,000
3 layout and you want to render it on a

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,640
constraint space you will find out that

107
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,890
there are two main problems actually the

108
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,830
first problem is that there's a lot of a

109
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,410
new space actually the entire white

110
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,050
square behind the tree is a lot of a new

111
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,110
space and the other problem is that if

112
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,390
you add a level to the standard tree it

113
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,360
won't feed anymore so researchers

114
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,790
thought about changing you know the

115
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,510
visual metaphor of parent-child

116
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,740
relationships in just something that

117
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,300
would make a visualization that could

118
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,540
fit in a constraint space and so b is a

119
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,360
child of a they thought it could be a

120
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,830
child of a B is contained in a and so by

121
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,320
changing this metaphor they made a

122
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,600
visualization which solved the true

123
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,850
problems actually it fits in the entire

124
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,050
rectangle and if you add add levels in

125
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,820
indefinitely it will still fit and so

126
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,100
this is the tree map visualization there

127
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,610
are many different types of trim up

128
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,260
tiling algorithms each one has different

129
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,500
characteristics so for example if you

130
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,510
were to find an element alphabetically

131
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,090
you could use a slice and dice layout

132
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,320
because it lays nodes ordered but for

133
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,020
example for what you use a trim app on a

134
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,630
mobile device with it with a touch

135
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,360
device would be better to use those

136
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,300
qualified layout because notes are more

137
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,020
like square fish and so is it's it's

138
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,220
easier to tap on a node from a score if

139
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,990
I trim up than nearest to tap on another

140
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,260
no slice and dice trim up which as you

141
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,480
can see notes are quite thinner and so

142
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,440
you can

143
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,710
you know make mistakes easier and so

144
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,950
these are freely out there are many

145
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,620
along layouts actually but I implemented

146
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,530
free of them this is actually a tree map

147
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,580
of the music I listen to so there's a

148
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,560
band Incubus if you drill down the tree

149
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,130
map you can see the album's very smooth

150
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,390
animations for everything same here this

151
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:47,000
is clarified layout and you can change

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,190
the layout also on the Flyers animations

153
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,920
for that too so this is a strip layout

154
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,320
of the tree map this is a slice and dice

155
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,470
as you can see notes have a higher

156
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,580
aspect ratio they are not very squared

157
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,970
as you can see but they can be sorted

158
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:10,930
which is kind of nice in some cases and

159
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,610
so following the idea of space fading

160
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,610
visualizations you have like radial

161
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,530
layouts of space filling visualizations

162
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,530
for example the sunburst visualization

163
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,950
which is generally used well is used on

164
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,710
many different things but generally it's

165
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,440
used on file system visualizations so

166
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,610
for example this is the code this is the

167
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,500
source of the of the project itself

168
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,620
mapped on the visualization the

169
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,539
uncompressed source of course so when

170
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,580
you click on a node you have you know

171
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,830
the last commit on github it's file size

172
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,890
and what it was last modified and you

173
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:55,210
can focus on an old

174
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,290
now you can extend this visualization

175
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,800
for four graphs so not just trees in

176
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,930
this case I'm using something called

177
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,650
hyper lines to connect nodes it behaves

178
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:14,490
just the same then you have the Icicle

179
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,310
space-filling visualization in which you

180
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,000
know a parents children are actually on

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,130
the right or at the bottom of its parent

182
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,750
this also used for filesystem

183
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,030
visualizations generally but you can use

184
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,520
it for whatever you like for your keys

185
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,330
as you can see can handle a good amount

186
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:45,150
of nodes this visualization was house

187
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,030
was actually contributed by

188
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,580
visualizations like the one that you're

189
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,150
seeing are like more intuitive it's

190
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,950
easier to understand another link vs

191
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,290
ation it's easier to see what's the

192
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,180
topology of a tree with a node link

193
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,490
visualization and also what you can do

194
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,550
is you know add extra information on the

195
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,680
edges like coloring the edges or adding

196
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,990
a line width etc something that you

197
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,190
can't do with space filling

198
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,140
visualizations at least when I showed

199
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,540
you see there there are no edges or the

200
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,060
visualizations in this ones you have so

201
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,890
the first one is a radio layout of a

202
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,110
graph which is kind of simple to make

203
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,030
but researchers made a lot of research

204
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,270
about how to make intuitive or non

205
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,240
confusing animations for this and I'm

206
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,970
going to and so they arrived to the

207
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,920
conclusion that by changing free things

208
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,250
you could make you know more

209
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,980
understandable animations with a radial

210
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,140
layout and so I'll be describing these

211
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,939
three things

212
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:56,860
so this is a rare layout of a more

213
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:07,360
general graph so if I were to click on

214
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,660
node 9c the top left nodes which are on

215
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,319
the on the Outer Ring they will remain

216
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,600
on the same outer rain on the new

217
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,879
position but during the animation they

218
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,619
will get all cluttered in the middle and

219
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,540
this will make the animation quite

220
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,209
confusing see they get all in the middle

221
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:28,149
that's because they use some linear you

222
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,639
know the shortest path to do the

223
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,739
animation from the starting to the

224
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:36,759
ending position by changing a

225
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,100
rectangular to polar interpolation you

226
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,290
will see that during the animation notes

227
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,209
will remain on the same outer concentric

228
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,160
ring which is kind of more

229
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,889
understandable for the animation itself

230
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,850
same goes for another case say for

231
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,459
example you have a central node and lots

232
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:57,489
of notes on the on the first ring if you

233
00:11:57,489 --> 00:12:02,579
click on white if you click on this node

234
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,319
you will see that the notes jump on the

235
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:08,230
outer ring but they also rotate a lot so

236
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,389
it's kind of complicated to understand

237
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:13,540
word notes are now and to actually

238
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,480
follow each node properly but if you add

239
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,579
this constraint you'll see that the

240
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:21,850
notes just jump out and they remain on

241
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,860
the same relative angle so this makes

242
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,589
the the visualization more you know

243
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:29,559
understandable and these are the kind of

244
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,309
things that in focus researchers work on

245
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:36,639
and I kind of implement these things on

246
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,410
a toolkit so then you have a hyperbolic

247
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,899
to visualization and this is what it's

248
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,139
called a focus best context technique it

249
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:49,119
has sort of like a magnifying glass

250
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:52,119
effect in which the sensor node has a

251
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,529
lot of detail and then there is

252
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,259
the tree is kind of distorted to fit

253
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,019
into a disk and in order to make this

254
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,749
effect what you use is another type of

255
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,670
geometry which is called a hyperbolic

256
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,160
geometry which is actually the same

257
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,319
geometry s-curl I don't know if you know

258
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:15,019
him uses to make his heart so I'm going

259
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,319
to show a couple of examples of this

260
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:22,790
he's a very simple transmission as you

261
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,949
can see the center node gets bigger and

262
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:28,430
the other nodes remain on the constraint

263
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,959
space what you can also do is add graph

264
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,180
operations on the tree so say for

265
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,639
example you'd like to remove the bottom

266
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,399
right subtree you can do it with

267
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,309
animation say you want to remove some

268
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:47,689
edges you can also do it the top left

269
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:50,269
edges with an animation and will

270
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:52,910
recalculate the position automatically

271
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,740
you can add a graph or transform a graph

272
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,480
into another graph by adding and

273
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,430
removing notes so this is just a generic

274
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,009
model that works on abstract graphs and

275
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,750
you can implement it on any

276
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,920
visualization you want then there's this

277
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,139
pastry this is like a more intuitive

278
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,720
layout of a tree with the addition of

279
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,110
the fact that you collapsed sub trees

280
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,809
which aren't in the path between the

281
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,779
clicked node and the root node and when

282
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,300
you collapse these sub trees you do an

283
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,399
animation and you also add some type of

284
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,339
visual encoding to you know inform the

285
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:36,230
user that what is the topology of the

286
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,899
tree like is that a big surgery there or

287
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:41,329
how number of know how many number of

288
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:46,660
notes that it does it have etcetera so

289
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,610
this is a very simple example this all

290
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,889
on the demos page of the of the homepage

291
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,809
of the toolkit see if you click on a

292
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,819
node it makes all those animations of

293
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:58,610
contracting and expanding subtrees you

294
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,230
can change the tree orientation also and

295
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,819
besides selecting a node what you can

296
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:06,240
also do is you know

297
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,820
set a notice route that will change the

298
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,180
topology of the tree itself now you have

299
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:19,920
another tree with another route then you

300
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,589
have the force directed graph so first

301
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,450
affected is a physical system simulation

302
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,290
in which all nodes have a repulsive

303
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,110
force and notes which are connected to

304
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,970
each other have also an attractive force

305
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,950
and you run this for a couple of times

306
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,959
and then you make a layout and what's

307
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,010
interesting about this layout is that

308
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,680
symmetries are preserved so you can see

309
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,440
the symmetries of our graph by doing

310
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,080
this layout and also it makes

311
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,440
aesthetically pleasing layouts it's very

312
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,589
useful for general graphs generally you

313
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,290
know this is just not a tree anymore

314
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,450
this example is also interesting because

315
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,420
it is like a small graph editing tool in

316
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,770
which you can add panning and zooming

317
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,470
and you can drag and drop nodes and you

318
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,829
can click on a node and select it and

319
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:12,480
you can delete notes and cetera at those

320
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,820
so this is a very simple example you

321
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,920
have the code here and you can access

322
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,660
and so this might be quite useful to

323
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:32,940
some some people okay some examples so

324
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,790
this is a trimmer visualization I made

325
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:41,670
of Doctor Who's valence so each villain

326
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,790
is a is a rectangle or it's represented

327
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,620
by a rectangle and the size of the

328
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,120
rectangle is proportional to the number

329
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,880
of episodes the villain appears on so

330
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,270
you can kind of drill down and have more

331
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,459
information on demand like the stories

332
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,459
of your own appears on and then what you

333
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,560
can do is kind of have a dynamic

334
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,930
filtering on the tree map so here on the

335
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,459
right I have the name of all the actors

336
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,780
who played doctor who from 1963 to 2010

337
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,060
and so you can filter the villain

338
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,530
is through this bar so you click here

339
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,190
and just your dynamic filtering which is

340
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:28,760
kind of interesting

341
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:33,070
then you have an old example of artists

342
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,409
and relationships but I don't know if

343
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:38,529
you know it it's kind of like a six

344
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:42,549
degrees of separation to Kevin Bacon so

345
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:44,620
you have a band which is centered and

346
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,779
all the members of the band on the on

347
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,730
the first level and then you have other

348
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,740
bands related to those members on the

349
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,500
second level and so when you click on an

350
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,690
artist it will fetch the information via

351
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,679
Ajax and morph the graph into the new

352
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,240
graph of relations and so what's

353
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,890
interesting about this is that you can

354
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,380
browse up which has lots of you know

355
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,520
collaborators and it works pretty well

356
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,740
and this is actually done with the one

357
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,789
dot 0 version so not that many of the

358
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:21,190
optimizations in the code then then I

359
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,200
was surprised to find this article from

360
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,559
google wave developer blog in which a

361
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,840
person was you know mapping the shape of

362
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,500
a wave into a visualization so I found

363
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,880
this dis article which was quite

364
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,019
interesting surface are unavailable

365
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:42,270
Mozilla also used it used actually the

366
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,770
hyperbolic trivialization to make a

367
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,880
community map so they styled it with and

368
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,940
then you have other examples the

369
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,890
Guardians embedded a tree map inside of

370
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,260
a data block page and that work sorry ah

371
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,450
I don't know if I have the link but you

372
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,279
made it right oh well I don't know if I

373
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:13,260
have

374
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:19,820
was it like for this yeah that's it

375
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:27,230
right yeah I don't know where but you

376
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:34,340
have also fourth grade so what's next

377
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,340
I've just merged a branch in which i

378
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,990
implemented WebGL on the toolkit I'm

379
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,780
working on trying to you know map what's

380
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,600
to the canvas on to some primitives on

381
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,440
3d so as to be able to scale to a lot of

382
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,340
notes by using you know the GPU also

383
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,010
working on Howard acceleration for by

384
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,170
using CSS free you know one emotions and

385
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,090
stuff like that and working on 3d

386
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,929
layouts I have a small example of this

387
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,110
on a nightly so we can crash it's a very

388
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,780
simple example so this is actually a

389
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,010
force directed graph render it on WebGL

390
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:23,510
with the API of the javascript in forest

391
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,320
okay what you can also do is just add

392
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,800
notes dynamically it will recalculate

393
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,700
the layout

394
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,200
and so that's it if you have any

395
00:20:43,200 --> 00:21:05,580
questions about the implementation yes

396
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,009
okay so actually the entire toolkit has

397
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,799
a nice namespace which is a dollar jet

398
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,889
and so you can if you don't have a

399
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:18,019
toolkit that also has dollar jit as

400
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,080
namespace you could put it with it with

401
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,619
another library tools place with with

402
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:27,649
variables and it works fine so it just

403
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:30,379
just 11 global element dollar jit and

404
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:33,049
then torch it dot whatever to create

405
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:36,980
your visualizations no defense

406
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,679
whatsoever no that's why you can create

407
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,779
your own build because you know if you

408
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:44,389
put all the visualizations together even

409
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:46,009
if you're not using them it's not very

410
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:48,080
practical because you are adding lots of

411
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,629
code that you won't be using but it's

412
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,369
interesting to see that there's actually

413
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:58,580
a builder and so you can just select

414
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,129
yeah I want the our graph and hyper tree

415
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,830
and you use either closure compiler or

416
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,559
no no compression and no compression you

417
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,419
have the entire documentation inside of

418
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,909
the code so it's good for testing and

419
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:15,930
just understanding what this stuff does

420
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:29,790
yes

421
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,800
so what's to protiv is compare it to

422
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,960
proud of is I think that I'm not sure

423
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,150
because i haven't used it a lot but i

424
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,460
think that they have a good amount of

425
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,200
layouts different layouts and charts and

426
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,150
said ran for charts is very you can you

427
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,130
can really customize a lot what you can

428
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,910
do with the toolkit for charts

429
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,110
specifically which was the last thing

430
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,390
thing added there's a very simple api

431
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,360
and so it's easy to use for for easy

432
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,520
things but perhaps more complex things

433
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,870
can take a you know hacking more code

434
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,700
but i think that the the adventure is

435
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,890
the advantage is that you also have like

436
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,190
smooth animations for everything and

437
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,870
generally when you are you know drilling

438
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,730
down a tree map its kind of useful to

439
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,460
have the animations because understand

440
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,850
better the zooming part and etc and also

441
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,180
i think that you know being able to be

442
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,030
working with WebGL right now is that the

443
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,560
fact that i'm guaranteeing that by the

444
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,870
end of the year you will have if you

445
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,470
have a WebGL spec which is final you

446
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,330
will have a toolkit that works with it

447
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,610
and you will be able to scale 200

448
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,130
thousands of nodes easily so i think

449
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:48,870
that these are kind of the differences

450
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,320
any other question
