1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:05,790

good morning J is calm food a past being

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,259
the first Speaker of the day I have to

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,240
you know be the one for today that

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,550
points out once again how lucky we are

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,110
to be standing in this you know sitting

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,599
in this venue getting to listen to the

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,850
brilliant minds of our day sharing

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,590
things and they will be coming up later

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,710
but until then I'm going to talk for a

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,070
few minutes the title of my talk as it

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,050
says is NBC Mozart Violin Concerto

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,900
versus model-view-controller and you may

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,489
be like okay old guy on stage

14
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,700
model-view-controller that makes sense

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,899
the truth is I'm not going to mention

16
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,480
model-view-controller probably even once

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,399
it just makes a really good pun with

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,120
Mozart Violin Concerto this is me I'm

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,600
from Vancouver and in Canada though I

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,190
was originally born in the States please

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,420
don't hold that against me I've been in

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,840
Canada for 20 years my current role is

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,399
I'm head instructor of lighthouse labs

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,170
which is a software development bootcamp

25
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,180
that means my job is to teach people

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,300
everyday about coding I have been a web

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,309
developer for 19 years

28
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,070
I remember when we still had like the

29
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,830
macro media preload images rollover in

30
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,330
JavaScript like that was advanced

31
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,119
JavaScript for a web page I remember

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,830
those days but this is also me I started

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,350
off with a degree in music from Columbus

34
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,970
State University in Columbus Georgia

35
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,090
and my original goal in life was that I

36
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,369
was going to perform in opera orchestras

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,470
and ballet orchestras and musicals all

38
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,869
around the world and live that kind of

39
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,000
Jet Set tuxedo life and that was going

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
to be my world but interestingly in 1998

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,290
I got introduced to the world of web

42
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,759
development computers had always been a

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,159
hobby of mine I'd always loved using

44
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,060
computers and I found this this web

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,610
thing that people were talking about and

46
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,030
using HTML and using what barely passed

47
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,060
for CSS at that point and I had a couple

48
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,770
really good mentors who introduced me to

49
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,020
what best practices were and how to get

50
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,090
involved and I found that the web was a

51
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,030
perfect canvas if I could imagine it it

52
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,009
could go on the screen and that

53
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,020
motivated me that move

54
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,450
and my hobby and my career swapped

55
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,910
places in the span of literally about

56
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,520
four days during which time I built

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,620
probably the worst webpage ever it was

58
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,690
purple it had fish at the top there was

59
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,240
a big forum where every input field was

60
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,000
about this wide on an 800 by 600 screen

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,340
of course but I'm still an active

62
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,860
musician I performed principal horn with

63
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,450
the Vancouver Pops Orchestra and a few

64
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,100
other organizations in Vancouver and

65
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,400
it's very much a part of my life and

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,020
with something being that much a part of

67
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,740
your life

68
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,370
you end up analyzing the ways in which

69
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,160
you can get better in all the parts of

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,830
your life and I started to notice as I

71
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,610
progressed some crossovers between music

72
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,520
and technology and they weren't just you

73
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,470
know the common ones like I listen to

74
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,210
music while I'm coding that that's an

75
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,520
obvious one as I this I realized that

76
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,320
what I was searching for more than

77
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,030
anything else is I was searching for a

78
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,970
way for my music to make my technology

79
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,020
better and the creative side of me the

80
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,600
analytical side of me started having a

81
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,640
conversation and if you've ever had that

82
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,870
many voices in your head well you

83
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,260
probably need medication but I found

84
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,150
some some interesting parallels there

85
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,730
and so I figured this was something I

86
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,170
could get up onstage and I could talk

87
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,140
about because approach for us as

88
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,650
developers is everything but it is a

89
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,570
tech presentation so I have to have an

90
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,820
obligatory Jeff so I wanted to get that

91
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,700
one out of the way early and I want to

92
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,010
start off this morning with a little bit

93
00:03:50,010 --> 00:04:08,070
of culture if the sound would play

94
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,120
that gives gives you a preview of what's

95
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:26,740
coming up

96
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,900
Noyce I promise this worked about half

97
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:51,250
an hour ago

98
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,100
yeah

99
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,970
which is weird because it was virtual

100
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:05,770
for perfect

101
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:26,039
and now for some culture that was the

102
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,159
entrance for the violin soloist to the

103
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:31,919
Mozart Violin Concerto number one that's

104
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,479
15 seconds of your life that you won't

105
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,569
get back but it's 15 seconds of your

106
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,750
life that you listen to something that

107
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,849
you probably weren't paying attention to

108
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:43,409
the fact that there was a tremendous

109
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,189
amount of structure and technique and

110
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,659
things going on behind it you're just

111
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,039
like oh hey Mozart first thing in the

112
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,779
morning not bad but I want to take that

113
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,310
that clip and I want you to now listen

114
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,509
to it again in your head I'm not gonna

115
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:01,590
play it again but listen to it in your

116
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,029
head again and think about the fact that

117
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,699
there is a very solid structure there

118
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,819
there's a very definite set of technique

119
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,400
that is being demonstrated there and the

120
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,110
reason I point these things out is

121
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,110
because when we go to use a web

122
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,120
application as consumers because we're

123
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,620
all consumers of the web as well as

124
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,879
builders of the web but when we go to

125
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,550
use a web application we don't think

126
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,400
about the structure that's going on when

127
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,349
you sit down and you use Instagram or

128
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:29,969
Facebook you're not thinking about the

129
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,379
load balancers you're not thinking about

130
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:33,419
the caching or the Reedus sessions or

131
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,009
whatever may happen to be going on

132
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,500
behind the scenes you're just using an

133
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,089
app and that's fine and we we think we

134
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:43,680
might peel the curtain back and think

135
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,229
about what's going on underneath but

136
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:49,889
music has that same structure and so

137
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,800
this usually brings up the question of

138
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,680
who cares great music has structure gone

139
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,529
we knew that but if I'm going to talk

140
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:02,069
about these parallels then I actually

141
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:04,259
have to start pointing out some very

142
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,319
specific areas where we should care we

143
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,020
as developers should care and the reason

144
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,629
is we as musicians and developers get to

145
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,569
think similarly quick show of hands how

146
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,370
many of you have spent at least one year

147
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,169
of your life

148
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:20,090
either taking using music lessons

149
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,520
playing in a musical group singing a

150
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,900
chorus something like that fair number

151
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,020
that's going to help me quite a bit

152
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,599
users care the reason users care is

153
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,639
because software and music are both a

154
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,840
craft if you go to the symphony and you

155
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,439
are listening to lang lang or Yo Yo Ma

156
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,779
or Itzhak Perlman or any of the the

157
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:48,469
great great performers of our day you

158
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,259
are seeing an absolute virtuoso a craft

159
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,229
you know a crafts person at work very

160
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,169
similarly you know when we go and we use

161
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,469
a lot of the you know powerful and

162
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:02,689
well-built apps that we use every day we

163
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,599
are seeing a craft at work when we see

164
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,479
someone up here live coding and we see

165
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,610
the the techniques that they are

166
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,259
demonstrating we're watching a

167
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,159
craftsperson

168
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,580
at work that's impressive and I would

169
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,460
much rather eat at a Michelin star

170
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,159
restaurant where the chef is a

171
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,949
consummate master of their craft than at

172
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:25,520
Burger King

173
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,490
for example the craftsmanship of our

174
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,610
work matters and I say that you should

175
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,979
care because I said earlier approaches

176
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,250
everything if we can get better at

177
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,990
approaching our craft we will make

178
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,149
better products and I'm going to stand

179
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:42,110
up here I'm going to say something

180
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,969
slightly controversial but I won't break

181
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:45,320
the code of conduct not that kind of

182
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,680
controversial and it's that for all the

183
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,500
work that we do we don't get hired to

184
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,990
code there's not a single person in this

185
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,949
room that is employed to code we get

186
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:00,079
hired to build products that's what we

187
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:04,370
do we support the benefit that data is

188
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,740
going to give to a user

189
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,140
we provide features that give those

190
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,000
users benefit and ultimately our

191
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,380
products generate revenue for our

192
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,819
company's revenue turns into our

193
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,940
paychecks and let's face it while we

194
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,889
care about our craft and we care about

195
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,260
the creativity we also care about

196
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,860
getting paid so you should care approach

197
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,750
makes better preventer approach makes

198
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,329
better products and I should care

199
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:30,980
because I decided to be brave and talk

200
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,589
about this so I have to care about

201
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:34,910
let's talk a little bit about Mozart

202
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,380
this is your history lesson for the

203
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,640
morning Mozart was born in 715 1756

204
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,920
lived until 1791 for those of you that

205
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,690
are doing the math that means he died at

206
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,020
about 35 36 years of age so he had a

207
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,180
very short life most of the things that

208
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,860
you've heard about him are true don't

209
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,390
pay attention in the movie Amadeus it's

210
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,980
completely farcical but he was

211
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,630
absolutely a virtuoso of his time he was

212
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,910
a child prodigy he was composing his

213
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,950
first opera at the age of five he was

214
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,140
performing in public at the age of four

215
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,660
like huge salon performances where

216
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,700
hundreds of people would come to listen

217
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,850
to him play he was absolutely the rock

218
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,600
star of his time and interestingly in

219
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,560
his very short life I he composed a

220
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,600
tremendous body of work by the time he

221
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,300
died he had over 600 completed works

222
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,930
that is prolific in a way that we can't

223
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,750
fathom really as developers if I was to

224
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,310
ask for a show of hands I doubt any of

225
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,690
you would be able to raise your hand and

226
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,750
say that you have 600 completed products

227
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,700
that you have built in your lifetime and

228
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,089
these are 600 products that are out in

229
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:45,410
the marketplace that people are

230
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,810
consuming and using and other people are

231
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,839
are being inspired by and this is just a

232
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,190
short list of what he was able to

233
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,510
contribute in his lifetime I mean 22

234
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,329
operas those are huge and he wrote 22 of

235
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:00,740
them and had two more that were

236
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,370
unfinished on top of that I'm 44 I got

237
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,829
pants on this morning like that's my

238
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:09,140
accomplishment and trust me I'm happy

239
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:15,910
about that like thank you right

240
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,860
so what I wanted to find was taking the

241
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,600
example of someone like Mozart who's

242
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,730
famous for being very prolific and

243
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,190
having tons and tons of works that he

244
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,709
was able to complete I wanted to figure

245
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:32,040
out how I could hack my productivity if

246
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,709
I could use someone like Mozart or Bach

247
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,779
or Beethoven or any of the great masters

248
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,510
of music and look at how they built

249
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,269
their products look at how they

250
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,480
approached their craft and see if there

251
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,100
was something that I could learn from it

252
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,260
in order to make me a better developer I

253
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,870
mean I you know I build JavaScript all

254
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,029
the time I know several languages I've

255
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,600
been around the block not my first rodeo

256
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,370
but I wanted to get better I always want

257
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,260
to get better and so I started to look

258
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,540
at what approach they were using

259
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,089
specifically Mozart being so prolific

260
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:07,949
what approach they were using that I

261
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:11,070
could be inspired by and I had to ask

262
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,550
myself what does it have to do with code

263
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,329
and initially it wasn't there wasn't a

264
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:20,850
lot that was forthcoming because while a

265
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,860
lot of has been written about Mozart's

266
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,839
life nobody really sat down and

267
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,970
interviewed him Barbara Walters style to

268
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,560
you know figure out what made him tick

269
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,990
back in you know 1780 or something like

270
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,779
that you know we didn't have TMZ you

271
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,940
know following around with pictures so

272
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,260
it was a little bit harder to figure out

273
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,389
so I had to do just a bit of analysis

274
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,550
based on what I knew and what I could

275
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,350
find and there were a couple things that

276
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,110
came out that allowed me to take lessons

277
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,970
of Mozart's life and apply them to code

278
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,579
and the first the biggest was structure

279
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,720
one of the things that mozart is

280
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,490
absolutely famous for is the structure

281
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,220
of his music he pretty much defined the

282
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,010
Classical period of music much to the

283
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,959
chagrin of many other composers of that

284
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,310
age Mozart was seen as the paradigm very

285
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,220
much you know we might look at say Dan

286
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,880
Abramov's

287
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,160
egg head tutorials as the the paradigm

288
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,449
of how to learn Redux

289
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,279
although I know all of you have that

290
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,870
perfect blog post that explains it way

291
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,459
better than he does it's not like you

292
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:23,370
wrote it or anything but structure was

293
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,850
important to to Mozart

294
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,539
and our apps have structure you know I

295
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,609
can put up this diagram and we can all

296
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:34,739
trace through it and see you know

297
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,539
there's a service okay we've got cloud

298
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:38,249
storage we've got external thing for

299
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:41,579
sessions we understand the workflow here

300
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,769
but we're very careful about building

301
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,889
structures like this whether it is just

302
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:48,959
a simple web app you know even though

303
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,239
like a one-page or and express whether

304
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:55,470
it is a complex bordering uncomplicated

305
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,929
you know distributed micro service

306
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:59,699
architecture and everything that would

307
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,949
go into that our apps have a very

308
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:03,959
definite structure in fact the

309
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,449
structures that we use we tend to call

310
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:08,069
them design patterns and that can go

311
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:10,350
from everything like the async if he's

312
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,459
that Jonathan was talking about

313
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,609
yesterday turn Ares all the way up to

314
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:18,359
entire app structure like this well

315
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:21,359
musicians composers particularly have a

316
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,369
structure to their music the one that

317
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:25,350
Mozart was famous for perfecting was

318
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,729
what's called the Sonata Allegro form

319
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:29,339
and I promise that you looking at this

320
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,229
is the same effect that musicians have

321
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:34,559
when they look at this but this is a

322
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,039
very particular form that most of the

323
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,379
music that Mozart wrote follows in fact

324
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,959
the piece that we listened to earlier if

325
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,639
we were to listen to the whole thing and

326
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,799
this was a music theory class and I had

327
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,809
four hours of your life that I could put

328
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,970
into analyzing it we would be able to

329
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,089
break down very easily onto this diagram

330
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:56,850
that piece of music once you've heard it

331
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,249
a couple times you almost can't unhear

332
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:01,919
it the exposition the development the

333
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,619
regular recapitulation they're very

334
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:08,519
obvious as structure of the music we

335
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,169
envision our applications as whole

336
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:13,829
systems a lot of times we're responsible

337
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,600
for one small piece of it a lot of times

338
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,309
we're responsible for architecting the

339
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:21,539
entire broad hole but we see them as as

340
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:24,179
whole systems but they have structures

341
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,839
inside of them this is the structure of

342
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,419
a few I'm going to go back 75 years

343
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,189
further in musical history to Johann

344
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:35,909
Sebastian Bach 1685 to 1750 not that you

345
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,169
care

346
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,130
Bach was famous for the few

347
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,410
which is four completely independent

348
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,940
lines anywhere from two to five actually

349
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,180
but four completely independent lines of

350
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,190
music four different melodies being

351
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,829
played together at the same time to form

352
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:55,190
a whole new piece of music sounds a lot

353
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,069
like concurrency asynchronous operations

354
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:00,290
parallel processing a lot of the things

355
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,480
that we would have in our applications

356
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,470
on a daily basis second big piece was

357
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,899
approach structure matters okay I know I

358
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,850
need to focus on the structure but then

359
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,980
I need to think about the approach how

360
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,130
am I going to think about my application

361
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,370
my product my composition before I write

362
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,769
it and I realized that I had to look at

363
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:27,410
it the same way structurally that a

364
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,850
musician would look at a piece of music

365
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,329
and musicians especially since a lot of

366
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,399
you have experience we have two ways of

367
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,750
thinking we have the horizontal or

368
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,399
melody and we have the vertical which is

369
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,160
our harmony so horizontally how can I

370
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,399
think about things and one of the the

371
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,319
quotes that's great comes from Edward de

372
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,130
Bono and 1967 so it's even older than I

373
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,029
am

374
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,160
but he talks about how lateral thinking

375
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,029
is stepping to one side laterally and

376
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:57,760
thinking about something in an

377
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,190
unconventional way taking steps to solve

378
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,110
a problem that you may not have

379
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,150
otherwise thought were the

380
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,010
straightforward way to solve a problem

381
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,829
we've all had that moment typically we

382
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,600
call it you know being clever or mad

383
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,579
hacks or one of those terms that

384
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,709
justifies us doing something that might

385
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,929
be a little bit unconventional Mozart

386
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:20,030
did this all the time melodically in

387
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,000
Mozart's works he did things that were

388
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,280
considered unconventional for the time

389
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,370
but now are considered absolutely 100%

390
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,950
standard if he's when they first came

391
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,140
out you know when we first started

392
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,630
seeing this this pattern emerge it was

393
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,280
considered unconventional in a wild and

394
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,440
you know cowboy coding and yes I just

395
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,549
did finger guns but they were you know

396
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:45,440
that was an example of lateral thinking

397
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,230
being applied to the craft of building a

398
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,049
piece of music this is actually the the

399
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,820
written out music for what you just

400
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,810
listened to a few minutes

401
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,130
ago and there is a very definite

402
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,440
horizontal flow the melody of a piece of

403
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,680
music is the horizontal flow of that

404
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,460
music when we're thinking about that

405
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,680
progressing over time you know this

406
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,630
becomes a timeline as much as it does

407
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,380
just a direction that the music is going

408
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,290
this is music borrowed from the theme of

409
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,590
a very popular TV show which involves

410
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,020
dragons and a lot of naked people whose

411
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,400
name I won't say for copyright reasons

412
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,230
but it rhymes with rain of Bones and

413
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,400
there's a couple things that are really

414
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,590
interesting in this piece of music and

415
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,640
for those of you that can read music

416
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,290
notation you're probably humming it in

417
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,620
your head but I've taken the liberty of

418
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,900
applying a couple of carefully placed

419
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,020
green arrows to show that even the

420
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,660
structure of this music is designed to

421
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,880
move it forward the melody is actually

422
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,820
designed to have you feeling that

423
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,480
anticipation it's almost like when we

424
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,020
build I don't know a tour on an app that

425
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,760
we've just built and we're trying to

426
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,950
draw that user in or when we monetize a

427
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,380
landing page and have calls to action

428
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,550
that they're going to draw the user

429
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,730
forward there is a pattern here of

430
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,250
thinking horizontally through time and

431
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,730
what is going to move our listener to a

432
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,520
piece of music or our user in web

433
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,500
application what is going to move them

434
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,420
forward in time algorithms a very wise

435
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,180
humble man who I I won't name though I

436
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,550
will say that he is bald and charming

437
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,630
and incredibly handsome came up with

438
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,280
this quote in the middle of the night

439
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,110
one night but algorithms are the

440
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,110
melodies of an application and this was

441
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,920
my aha moment this was my aha moment

442
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,490
where I could say this is how this is

443
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,260
that crux where the parallels really

444
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,140
start to click together these steps that

445
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,140
we take to process the data that we are

446
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,780
giving our users access to those are the

447
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,760
steps that move forward in time like the

448
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,220
individual notes that I would put into a

449
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,020
melody to have it move forward in time

450
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,670
our algorithms are the melodies of our

451
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,970
app when we're thinking horizontally as

452
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,580
a developer you know we'll take Robin as

453
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,440
a user Robin's gonna click a link that's

454
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,700
going to send to get requests from the

455
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,180
client clients going to hit the server

456
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,460
servers going to make an API call maybe

457
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,620
to some popular service that serves up

458
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,320
JSON data very nicely that API is going

459
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,600
to return some data we might take that

460
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,810
and send it into something like Watson

461
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,390
in order to analyze it and the server is

462
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,220
going to get data back from Watson build

463
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,510
a response and it's going to send it

464
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,990
back to Robin this is a horizontal

465
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,500
progression of steps that we can follow

466
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,200
very similar to how we might follow the

467
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,290
melody of a piece of music fizzbuzz is

468
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,450
another great example we all know how

469
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,760
fizzbuzz works and if you don't well

470
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,200
it's the worst Tech interview question

471
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,540
ever you just need to memorize ten ways

472
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,160
to do it that are all in one line in

473
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,420
different languages and then just ready

474
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,800
regurgitate it when you go for an

475
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,220
interview but this is a perfect example

476
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,920
of how we have a very linear set of

477
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,960
steps that we follow even though there's

478
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,430
some conditional branches in there but

479
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,020
there's a very linear progression over

480
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,270
time that leads us from one point to

481
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,780
another from problem to solution so as

482
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,550
our code moves from one step to another

483
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,010
the thinking that fuels our solutions is

484
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,650
linear it is horizontal and a lot of

485
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,690
times in the best cases when we are

486
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,400
doing something unconventional that

487
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,620
maybe hasn't been done before its

488
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,650
lateral let's talk about the vertical

489
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:42,200
now that other axis we call it a stack

490
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,170
we vertically arrange the components of

491
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,570
our applications and we call it a stack

492
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,210
when we have words like that you know

493
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,430
Hugh stack tree these are words that we

494
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,280
might use every day and they have

495
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,660
multiple meanings depending on whether

496
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,210
I'm pointing at you know a maple tree in

497
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,000
Vancouver Canada or whether I am you

498
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,200
know pointing at a directory structure

499
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,570
for example but we call it a stack

500
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,730
because there is a vertical relationship

501
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,390
in this case ember or react or view or

502
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,070
whatever your drug of choice is for

503
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,080
building your front-end is going to talk

504
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,940
to node nodes going to talk to Postgres

505
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,520
that's all sitting inside of a doctor

506
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,810
container running on a Linux server

507
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,820
somewhere you know and I'm not even

508
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,620
counting in the network layer here for

509
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,110
how we're how we're connecting to that

510
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,390
but it's a stack and it's very vertical

511
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,210
we code vertically as well as

512
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,700
horizontally all of these different

513
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,040
techniques here that we might use have

514
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,690
to do at any moment in time there's an

515
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,570
entire relationship of our application

516
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,210
in our data at that moment in time if

517
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,470
any click at any debug step if we were

518
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,600
putting breakpoints on every single line

519
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,430
of our code there's a vertical

520
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,420
relationship that we have there with the

521
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,980
different technologies that we brought

522
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,820
in and the interesting part about that

523
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,670
is that becomes one of the ways that we

524
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,170
have a challenge as developers our

525
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,600
challenge is to have our work be ignored

526
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,520
when I talked about sitting down and

527
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,950
using an application that had a great

528
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,580
amount of craft to it ideally the user

529
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,580
should forget that someone sat down and

530
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,230
typed that all out the user should

531
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,660
forget that someone had to debug and

532
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,120
ended up screaming at their computer the

533
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,310
user should forget you know whether we

534
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,600
were rubber ducking to solve that

535
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,520
problem or whether it took a stand-up

536
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,920
scrum of 10 minutes like the user

537
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,080
doesn't care ideally the user should

538
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,150
never have to think about the work that

539
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,370
we put into our application we're

540
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,990
building experiences for them we're

541
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,750
building products for them our problem

542
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,850
solving in our vertical architecture

543
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,060
should be transparent you know when we

544
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,070
have DNS problems or CloudFlare goes

545
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,500
down or you know github is down for

546
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,880
whatever reason there are a lot of

547
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,820
things that happen the DNS outage that

548
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,560
happened in eastern North America a

549
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,540
couple months ago when things like that

550
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,180
happen it affects our users but our

551
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,710
ultimate goal is that they should never

552
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,800
ever notice musicians have it just as

553
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:22,520
hard unfortunately this is a bit of

554
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,840
music from the Mozart Violin Concerto

555
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,240
I've taken the liberty of applying some

556
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,180
green lines to where the beats of the

557
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,049
music are as a musician especially if

558
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:35,989
you are a soloist you have to make sure

559
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:39,200
that as you are playing the meter of

560
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,239
your music the meter of the melody that

561
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:43,340
you're playing lines up with your

562
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,590
accompaniment you know just to go off on

563
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,360
your merry way and you know hope that

564
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,519
they catch up the same way that we

565
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,369
wouldn't want our react apt to just go

566
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:54,049
off and start processing things and

567
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:55,549
making assumptions about data without

568
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:58,039
ever actually querying the server for it

569
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,860
that would be bad

570
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,659
similarly when we're thinking vertically

571
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:05,389
as a musician we have the concept of

572
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:08,749
harmony basically are we in tune so I've

573
00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:11,869
circled an E flat major chord here if

574
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:13,249
you don't know what that is smile and

575
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:16,879
nod but the soloist on the top line

576
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:19,999
there has to make sure that that b-flat

577
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:22,279
that they are playing is going to be in

578
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,799
tune with the rest of the ensemble

579
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,419
you've probably all at one point or

580
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:28,249
another had to go to your nieces or

581
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:29,330
nephews

582
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,249
you know grade six band concert or

583
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:33,739
something like that and you know you had

584
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,809
that that moment of just cringing

585
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:37,609
because of the way it sounded

586
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:39,080
even though you were proud of them for

587
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,399
what they were able to accomplish of

588
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:43,389
course but tuning and being in harmony

589
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:47,899
matters and so this was where my second

590
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:51,409
AHA happened in thinking about this and

591
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:54,830
it came comes from this quote in tune on

592
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,799
time this quote comes from a gentleman

593
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,649
named dr. Frederic Finnell who was a

594
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:02,179
very famous conductor in the United

595
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:04,549
States he was the master of bands and

596
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:07,639
orchestras at Indiana University he was

597
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,590
about this tall he was a vicious little

598
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,389
beast of a man but he was a brilliant

599
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:14,720
musician and I had the privilege of

600
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,929
performing under his baton once and we

601
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:19,639
were having a particularly hard day in

602
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:22,190
rehearsal and he put down his baton and

603
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,440
he said ok I just want you to understand

604
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,710
one thing the process of making music is

605
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,859
very simple and he said let me let me

606
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:33,549
draw an analogy for baseball and

607
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:35,929
baseball being the quote sport of

608
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,450
America and all of that terrible way to

609
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,070
spend an afternoon but good beer and bad

610
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,139
hotdogs

611
00:26:41,139 --> 00:26:43,789
he made analogy to baseball players and

612
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:46,220
he said baseball players are paid

613
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,950
millions of dollars a year to hit

614
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,980
one-third of the pitches that are thrown

615
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,559
to them if they are exceptional they're

616
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,789
hitting 333 and he said musicians on the

617
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:02,330
average are barely paid minimum wage to

618
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,020
play 100% of the notes that are put in

619
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,760
front of them this this was the the aha

620
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,650
moment as I remembered this quote any so

621
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,950
what he said was musicians all we have

622
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,140
to do to be successful is we have to

623
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,159
play in tune on time if we can do that

624
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,650
the music will be beautiful everything

625
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,350
after that is just making music this is

626
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,020
all the technique you ever need and so I

627
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,400
got to thinking about that and I got

628
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,610
thinking about this in tune on time idea

629
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,230
when it comes to my applications and so

630
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,650
I asked myself can we apply that

631
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,700
mentality to development can we strip

632
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,960
away a lot of the the complexity that we

633
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,450
tend to add to the process and the

634
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,130
approach of building an application and

635
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,860
can we apply this mentality and of

636
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,419
course another famous quote came to mind

637
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:03,350
so I had to use that one and yes we can

638
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,840
Obama got elected on these three words

639
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,610
that in Twitter but if I'm looking at

640
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,039
musicians verse developers and how how

641
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,610
this in tune on time idea applies

642
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,250
musicians tell a story art is how we

643
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,049
decorate space music is how we decorate

644
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:24,230
time and a performer is stringing

645
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,730
together notes and melodies stacked on

646
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,289
top of harmonies but a developer

647
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,510
developers are offering solutions we are

648
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,490
building products we're giving access to

649
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,659
data the benefits users through our

650
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,190
implementation so an algorithm

651
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,530
implemented into an architecture creates

652
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,940
a product and so now a good user

653
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,159
experience I can define this by drawing

654
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,679
these parallels and saying a good a user

655
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,990
experience is one where the app runs in

656
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:56,149
tune on time when it just works for the

657
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:59,630
user when our approach has been to you

658
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,670
the lateral thinking to be aware of the

659
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,460
structure the underlying architecture of

660
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,190
our application to be very aware of that

661
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,990
algorithm that's progressing from start

662
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,140
to finish and if we can get our apps to

663
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,630
run in tune on time then we're gonna

664
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,070
have fantastic products I do have a

665
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,750
shameless plug please feel free to buy

666
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,730
my book I just published a book about

667
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,260
project planning putting a lot of these

668
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,340
ideas into place I'm very opinionated no

669
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,160
surprise I'm a developer and I'd love to

670
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,890
see these ideas getting shared because I

671
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,870
think they make a huge difference in the

672
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,910
way I approach applications now and

673
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,860
that's all I have to talk about to you
