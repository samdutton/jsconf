1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,980

okay so I think we just start off maybe

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,570
some other people's and more people will

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,849
show up but possibly because this is a

4
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:22,150
presentation on that Internet Explorer

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,830
that's not why so many people are

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,340
joining anyway I want to give you now an

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,810
overview of performance diagnosis in

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,160
Internet Explorer as you know there are

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,030
tools around for fire for Firefox as

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,250
well as for Safari but when it comes to

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,629
internet explorer there hasn't been

12
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:44,830
really a lot of options around still a

13
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,989
lot of people still using internet

14
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:48,519
explorer and there's the user community

15
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,890
is quite big especially when it come to

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,979
Internet applications a lot of people

17
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,110
actually using internet explorer and

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,850
there are performance problems in

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,369
internet explorer and just go so

20
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,739
everybody can do to solve them and how

21
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:05,379
to use a free tool and die natur is a

22
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,080
tradition to resolve the performance

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,179
problems here so beyond today mentioned

24
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:16,179
that love and software is about being

25
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:18,990
sexy and creating an impression and

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,789
thinking about that I again looked at

27
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,979
the Internet Explorer logo and realized

28
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:29,049
something here's some similarity did

29
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:31,869
this holy angel here but so its inlet

30
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,640
explorer really that's holy is it really

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,189
behaving that well well obviously not so

32
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:38,859
it's a thing the most hated browser out

33
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,659
there but still like trying to create

34
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:45,359
this image of the Holy Internet Explorer

35
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,679
well as this is not the case the

36
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,420
question is what can we actually do

37
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,689
about it so there are two approaches on

38
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:55,270
how to solve problems with internet

39
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,359
explorer the first one is doing voodoo

40
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,270
so yes yes in internet explorer voodoo I

41
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,729
can well that might not work that well

42
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,259
but at least you can try ready to solve

43
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,689
the problems or not the other approach

44
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:11,319
is for the german-speaking ones you can

45
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,490
read it for english-speaking ones

46
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,800
Internet Explorer has to stay outside so

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,390
we say okay simply we don't care about

48
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,500
Internet Explorer

49
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,330
skull people better use other browsers

50
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,420
because things are working there better

51
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,040
however reality is just a bit different

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,220
a lot of people aside using internet

53
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,569
explorer and we also have to find

54
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:31,370
problems in there I'll show you that

55
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,200
it's not that complicated as you might

56
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,720
think actually so will you see people

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,880
often when they're searching problems

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,380
and Internet Explorer especially because

59
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,100
proper tooling is missing that yes like

60
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,040
the guy here who started searching for a

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,810
nasty performance problem in his early

62
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,030
20 is now possibly being in his eighties

63
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,220
and still might not having found it's a

64
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,170
lot of years of toiling question the

65
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,880
more information you get the easier it

66
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,260
is for you to find out what their actual

67
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,720
problems might be the faster you are

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,670
resolving in those problems and it took

69
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,950
a quote here from a very famous book up

70
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,310
since sue the art of war which says if

71
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,989
you know the enemy and you know yourself

72
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:16,940
you need not fear the results of the

73
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,180
hundred battles so how often did you run

74
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,340
into either a functional problem or the

75
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,109
performance problem an Internet Explorer

76
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:26,660
so we're fighting couple a couple of

77
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,150
hundred of those battles the goal here

78
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,859
really should be to get a better

79
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:33,140
understanding of what's going on in

80
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,720
internet explorer and how you can find

81
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,450
out what's happening there and this is

82
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,640
what my talk will be about showing you

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,220
how you can find problems in internet

84
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,019
explorer I put a couple of topics that I

85
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,950
want to address here the first one is

86
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,079
normally you want to get fast overview

87
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,750
what's going on in your web application

88
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,060
just don't you don't want to initially

89
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,530
drilling through those details but

90
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,600
initially you want to get it faster will

91
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,940
be what's going on this application from

92
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,940
a networking perspective from a

93
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,549
JavaScript perspective also from a

94
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,530
rendering compass package is just you

95
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,730
can understand where is my problem

96
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,350
actually just what a javascript problem

97
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,930
network problem rendering problem

98
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,359
whatsoever so before going into the

99
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:22,070
details of resolving a problem you want

100
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,570
to know what it actually yes then one

101
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,919
part of that is understanding the flow

102
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,470
of time so what has

103
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,510
and over time when was something

104
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,160
downloaded from the network when was

105
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,410
some JavaScript execution how did this

106
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,080
JavaScript execution lead rendering two

107
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,940
additional network downloads and I like

108
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,650
to really get it fast over we would

109
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,990
happen to an application especially if

110
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,550
you think about really rich Internet

111
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,090
applications taking Google Mail here's

112
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,130
an example there's a lot of going on

113
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,620
constantly and no just want to have some

114
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,150
understanding with what's happening in

115
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,500
there what might have caused a problem

116
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,420
next one is the network one of the

117
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,100
low-hanging fruits and performance

118
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,410
optimizations for rap application so

119
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,820
what's going on in the network layer

120
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,470
what has been downloaded how long has

121
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,360
things taken to download have things

122
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,660
been cached or haven't they been cached

123
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,830
how much time has been spat on the

124
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,460
network on the server time for dns

125
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,990
lookups and the life that you want to

126
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,540
know okay if some javascript has been

127
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,910
executed or some event has been fired

128
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,860
what has actually been executed and you

129
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,419
want to get the whole loan that kind of

130
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,880
aggregated view just for one specific if

131
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,370
an event what did this actually lead to

132
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,580
and the browser that's what we refer to

133
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,610
pure pass will be providing a

134
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,780
transactional tray so for every single

135
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,510
click instead of that was aggregated

136
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,560
values that if you have a couple of

137
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,990
hundred user interface interactions you

138
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,180
don't have any idea which really what's

139
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,440
really going on in the browser here one

140
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,930
thing that's very often coming to coming

141
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,400
when you talk about browsers and

142
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,260
performance and what we heard a lot

143
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,220
after we initially released our diners

144
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,660
with aging seditionist tell us more

145
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,460
about rendering surrendering is crucial

146
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,740
to us we want to understand rendering

147
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,200
times we want to find out in detail how

148
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,760
rendering in the browser works what

149
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,590
effects rendering why something render

150
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,270
it what does it take so long what's

151
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,780
really going on there next one is

152
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,910
collaboration so very often you're not

153
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,940
working alone it's good as long as

154
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,470
you're me developer workspace but

155
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,210
someday your users or testers might come

156
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,530
back and say you know it's simply not

157
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,080
working so you can ask them okay what

158
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,569
did you do and then you go to the

159
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,309
page yourself try to do it yourself

160
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:43,830
which works quite fine if it's publicly

161
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,830
available don't need us the details of

162
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,499
those users but it's not and as soon as

163
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,689
it's a real world web application you

164
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,309
know it's private content and the like

165
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:55,409
you won't get all this information you'd

166
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,879
rather have the use of actually being

167
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,039
able to show you what he's actually done

168
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,020
and you being able to analyze the data

169
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,240
on hand additionally you what don't want

170
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,939
to go over to that user and say okay now

171
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,709
I'm just starting your browser with my

172
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,719
debugging tools in and type what you

173
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,699
just did I mean that's simply not the

174
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,919
way it is actually working so do you

175
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,539
rather want to capture that content so

176
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,639
you can capture it send it back to me so

177
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,050
that I can have a look at it and finally

178
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,059
able to become a bit too to testing so

179
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:27,330
how you can use use it for testing

180
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,909
purposes how you can integrate

181
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:31,319
performance analysis into testing and

182
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,990
find out what's going on and testing you

183
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,789
also show a short sample here so to show

184
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:41,039
you a bit how you could work on all

185
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,529
those topics I'll use a really complex

186
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,749
web site I think probably one of the

187
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:48,539
most complex HX website out there which

188
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,629
is the start page of Google ok it's at a

189
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,580
complex one but I've chosen it because

190
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,209
it has some JavaScript inside it has

191
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,059
some matrix going on on the page so if

192
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,499
you type in the keyword you will see

193
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:02,909
that you get these quick results and

194
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:07,259
I've chosen this example simply because

195
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,189
it actually shows you how you can use

196
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,419
the tool instead of having a very

197
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:13,680
complex example where a lot of

198
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,439
JavaScript is going on so if I were to

199
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,999
choose facebook to show you the same

200
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,829
thing first of all you could get all my

201
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:22,019
facebook messages that I don't want and

202
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,119
secondly the application is much more

203
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:26,189
complex to that it will hide a bit of

204
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,379
day the process behind it rather than

205
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,360
we're looking at what's going on the

206
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,199
application so just jump into diner who

207
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:38,909
is a tradition that I just launched here

208
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,089
so what I'm just doing is really

209
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:46,680
something very easy to do I'm just going

210
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,400
to

211
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,220
the google web page okay I'm over there

212
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:58,230
fine I'm doing now I'm just typing here

213
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,290
and what you see here it's just

214
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,760
refreshing this list and this is

215
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,690
obviously getting loaded from the server

216
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,310
dynamically at runtime so there's a

217
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,660
matrix going on so nothing really

218
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,630
spectacular but still enough for us to

219
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,400
see something going on what's going on

220
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,880
the web page okay so aside the first

221
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,040
thing that we want to see that we want

222
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,770
to get a fast overview work what's going

223
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,570
on well it's quite easy if you look at

224
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,280
one page but still what we've looked at

225
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,170
is so what do you really want to see

226
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,900
going on in the browser when something

227
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,710
happened so what do you want to

228
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,080
understand first of all here we had our

229
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,770
URL and there are a couple of typical

230
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,090
things you look at from a performance

231
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,280
perspective when looking at the website

232
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,620
and we try to some more aggregate all

233
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,600
this information in one page so that you

234
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,830
can get an inch lower viewed

235
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,260
understandably so where could my problem

236
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,560
be like here we resources so answering

237
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,520
basic questions how many resources has

238
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,920
been loaded over the network and how

239
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,360
many of these horses has been loaded

240
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,850
from the cash so we just hit the page

241
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,800
twice it just can look at those two

242
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,050
pages and say okay do we get all the

243
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,700
condom from the cash that we want to get

244
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,890
kept on the cash or now so as we see

245
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,170
here all images obviously come from the

246
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,540
cash part of the javascript is coming

247
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,940
from the cash as well just the HTML and

248
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,530
other portions of javascript and not

249
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,430
coming from their glory from networking

250
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,470
and not coming from the cash especially

251
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,940
for validating your caching strategy

252
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,840
this is quite used for the CEO exam then

253
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,380
from a networking perspective where you

254
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,000
actually want to understand is whether

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,600
you will spend your time on

256
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,269
so there are a lot of different points

257
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:53,579
on a network where can spend it here for

258
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,889
dns lookup for initial connect with the

259
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,410
time on the server or a transport onto

260
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,880
the time that is really used for sending

261
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,740
back the counters because if something

262
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,589
just takes long you don't necessarily

263
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,810
need why it's actually taking along so

264
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,670
it's the server taking so long to

265
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,440
produce the content is in slow network

266
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,959
or as we've also very often seen is it

267
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,480
possibly a DNS lookup that's just taking

268
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,899
that long of time and additionally what

269
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,370
we didn't have here because the website

270
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,319
was actually quite simple other

271
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:25,740
questions to answer like okay how long

272
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,319
did you actually have to wait until some

273
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:31,440
resource could be downloaded so as all

274
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,759
if you know browsers have a limited

275
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,350
number of connections that they can open

276
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,180
/ to main too long actually did it took

277
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,389
for two down if you buy it for a certain

278
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:42,690
resource secondly what kind of

279
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,730
JavaScript trigger there so where's most

280
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,269
of my JavaScript I'm coming from is it

281
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:50,759
coming from script blocks keyboard

282
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,540
events are the sources and additionally

283
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,350
which job portions of JavaScript consume

284
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,089
most of the time on my website so which

285
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,449
in which we call it here api's seed

286
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:08,220
libraries with a couple of different

287
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,410
JavaScript libraries it will ck in which

288
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,899
of those libraries did you spend most of

289
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,630
your time here just to see a bit more

290
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,810
content I'll just oops sorry come back

291
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,949
here and I'll let it load so obviously

292
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:26,790
it is a bit slow I just refresh it here

293
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,220
in real time and we will see the same

294
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,990
here for the next week west so we see

295
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,329
that again javascript is not coming from

296
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,540
the cash wherever image he isn't HTML is

297
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,820
now coming from

298
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,380
from the fraternity from network and

299
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,730
from networking perspective physically

300
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,290
spent actually most time on the server

301
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,500
and I do a lot of networking time here

302
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,710
the second part is that they understand

303
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,620
the flow of time so what did really

304
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,210
happen over time what do we have to

305
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,660
actually have to do hear something that

306
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,270
you will want to see is what will he

307
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,089
have what did you really do what is it

308
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,710
will it take maybe to take a bit more

309
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,830
complex website let's take that actually

310
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,100
it's quite fast as well taking one other

311
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,839
it just happened okay that takes a bit

312
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:30,650
longer okay going back here

313
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,389
so what we simply summer pier is the

314
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:38,470
time spanned from a cpu perspective

315
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,560
javascript so when with javascript

316
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,050
executed when did we render something in

317
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,240
this case from which domains have things

318
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,160
been downloaded and additionally we see

319
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,560
an event timeline here so we see all

320
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,110
major events like unload events it has

321
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,699
been treated say or longer taken tindie

322
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,949
a lot event and what was done after the

323
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:58,259
unload event so we see here that than

324
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:00,629
just something get downloaded some

325
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:03,509
rendering occurred rendering was

326
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,129
scheduled again and again some rendering

327
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,930
and some JavaScript execution right in

328
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,209
here so especially if you're running

329
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,769
longer death and you won't understand

330
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:12,509
what's going on it's really helps you to

331
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:15,540
get it first quite nice overview what's

332
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,389
really going on in the web page cuk hard

333
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,730
what has really been done over time in

334
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,250
those different performance relevant

335
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,620
areas of your application the same for

336
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,740
sure your guts whatever one wants to see

337
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,230
what it happened on the networking

338
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,360
layers that's also over time so just use

339
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,680
this page for one specific reason okay

340
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,800
because we see here breakdown of all the

341
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,360
pages have been downloaded how big it

342
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,639
was where it was retrieved from the

343
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,720
cache or not status codes and alike and

344
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,380
also all the content in here and here

345
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,339
also the split up in a different times

346
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,040
of time so here we see the wait time to

347
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,660
that's one of the examples were actually

348
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,370
have to wait to get it socket so there

349
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,920
is already parallel down that what's

350
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,490
going on on that page how much time was

351
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,350
wait time connect times over time

352
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,079
transfer time so we'll chance to see how

353
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,420
those different timing sum up to the

354
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,000
download of a specific web page as well

355
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,829
as we've seen all the request and

356
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,660
response headers that you see out there

357
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,180
so classical network analysis that you

358
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,370
see here what was going on from that

359
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:38,950
prosper

360
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,080
if finding out where the actual problems

361
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,230
in a specific page might be helping you

362
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,590
to understand to understand that and

363
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,000
what has words but what's going on in

364
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,280
there and you can also specifically sigh

365
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,550
just want to pick one of those resources

366
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,820
just a specific page and see what heart

367
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,740
download wasn't also here a timing chart

368
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,950
you'll see what the actual time has been

369
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,510
spent on like here we have this big blue

370
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,030
part if you look at that blue is

371
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,100
actually the transfer time so it took

372
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,290
some time to transfer here we mostly

373
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,270
were waiting for that if connections so

374
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,540
it helps you to get a quick I understand

375
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,680
what's actually going on the web page

376
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,330
download as well as seeing the actual

377
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,550
accountant additional is if you have now

378
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,890
identified our page we want to find out

379
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,870
what what was actually going on here

380
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,440
like in the Google page that's why I'm

381
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,990
coming now to what we call this tracing

382
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,450
analysis so what we show here is a

383
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,500
really old types of activities that were

384
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,200
happening on the specific page you can

385
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,700
choose which ones you actually want to

386
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,420
see so network activities rendering

387
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,270
activities and the likes you see here

388
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,280
really what what's happening at Google

389
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,620
we see here script execution as well as

390
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,970
you see the code browser down here you

391
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,620
see also the code parts which would have

392
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,839
been executed so it's actually execute

393
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,170
this is just kind of sweating mechanism

394
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,089
in here just as times at the sequently

395
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:13,720
triggered validating that field and like

396
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,190
and here again rendering activities and

397
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,990
also rendering being scheduled here like

398
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,740
taking this example here

399
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,610
okay seeing what's going on here and

400
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,530
especially as a rendering while but

401
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,330
actually caused rendering to happen so

402
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,220
we see it atrophy layered calculation

403
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,870
and also scheduling of layout in here so

404
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,840
that's actually quite deep inside her

405
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,490
rendering in the browser works because

406
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,810
where you ask me just see that you did

407
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,390
something and sometimes it takes long

408
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,420
for the page to be rendered again but

409
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,920
what have you actually done in your call

410
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,050
that cost that ran the ring in the

411
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,030
browser it had to happen or just your

412
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,450
browser Lee should CPU going up so here

413
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,280
you really see for example that we have

414
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,800
here a rendering layo task so really

415
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,780
following what the browser is doing so

416
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,160
how rendering here in the Internet

417
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,870
Explorer is for example working it just

418
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,640
takes specific component numbers them

419
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
like you see scheduling layer to just

420
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,710
say if you have a certain JavaScript

421
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,300
mastered just lay outing is just

422
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,520
scheduling and it's picked out add a

423
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,470
certain layer later time out of the

424
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,910
queue and then we rendered and you can

425
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,890
correlate those the actually rendering

426
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,960
activities due to the JavaScript code

427
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,360
that actually curl cost at random

428
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,880
because it might have happened seconds

429
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,190
before that you're just creating a lot

430
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,750
of events it for sample setting all the

431
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,940
CSS Styles creating all the winner

432
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,980
rendering activities on certain elements

433
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,110
and then you can also jump to care where

434
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,490
has it actually then been rendered or

435
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,330
here going back what this has actually

436
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,960
caused the rendering here as well as

437
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,670
really looking at different executions

438
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,170
like here we have a script execution

439
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,780
what will he was going on in the script

440
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,170
so here we see a variable being set in

441
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,410
asynchronous execution do Willie can

442
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,150
follow those asynchronous xq executions

443
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,970
over time and see what's going on we're

444
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,050
even flexible enough to just bit small

445
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,740
here capture all the arguments for

446
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,450
example freedoms that time out to see

447
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,920
what the time would actually was it has

448
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,270
been said here or what has been executed

449
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,410
so you will also get all those details

450
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,750
out of you too what were the parameters

451
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,660
methods were invoked in so very often

452
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,640
I've seen that when people started to

453
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,840
debug kind of thing

454
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,330
problems I don't immediately start off

455
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,130
debugging and say okay now and with

456
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,179
stabbing through all of the steps

457
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,610
because first you want to understand

458
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,650
what you actually have to be back so

459
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,880
just recently worked with one of our

460
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,559
users and they said well just what i'm

461
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,549
doing i'm selecting something in this

462
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:58,200
drop-down field and i'm jumping to the

463
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,360
next control and then certainly the

464
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,529
select field gets refreshed and what's

465
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:09,539
really going on first did before really

466
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,309
going into real debugging with debugging

467
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,710
tools just really looking what was going

468
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,409
on in the page and when this control

469
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:19,820
actually was accessed by which code and

470
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,049
finding out what actually triggered that

471
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:25,049
access of the component at the end we

472
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:28,700
found out that it was a very would say

473
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,950
nasty bugs it just funny God into that

474
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,470
text field it validated the content of

475
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,710
the text but it was it at type a typing

476
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,539
text field at help for the selection of

477
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,520
the Select box is realized oh I'm empty

478
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,309
so I'm selecting the 0 and it's really

479
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,260
fun debugging those things so what I

480
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,970
really get here is equally what's going

481
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,309
on over here and especially when you

482
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,340
have like me here we have our key

483
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,010
appearance on specific controls like in

484
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,429
this case the LST object which is the

485
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:02,690
only one in Google I can also say here

486
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,480
I'm just show me the LST stuff now

487
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,250
filter variable other controls and it

488
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,350
just see my keyboard events here for

489
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,360
example for that specific controls

490
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,419
that's for typing in here and to take

491
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,190
into the keyboard he will see a

492
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,169
scheduled rendering then so that's what

493
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:23,850
happening when he actually typed when it

494
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,279
will leave the key in the Google search

495
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,299
just rendering here and it's not

496
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,980
immediately updating it but it's setting

497
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,559
a timer so after some time executing

498
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,510
JavaScript and a JavaScript execution it

499
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,539
really is updating it field that's been

500
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:43,679
actually done by setting a specific Rick

501
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,039
script i can download

502
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:50,220
sometimes however just wondering at what

503
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,270
actually took the most time on my

504
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:59,010
webpage so checking and a google page

505
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,419
here in this case it was the one drawing

506
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,640
for sure and as well as this layering

507
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,000
task so what I then came d was a kid

508
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,190
what actually tweak its layout in tasks

509
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,640
I just can't kind of backtrack back

510
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,090
trace the ones that have happened here

511
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:22,620
like we see here okay what has triggered

512
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,510
this week calculations delay or decay

513
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,760
there was some rendering going on before

514
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,030
that which in JavaScript execution you

515
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,520
can't really walk back and also see the

516
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,140
code down here that is actually

517
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,590
triggered those dismantling and

518
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,970
californica where we've spent most of

519
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,730
her execution time and also how off and

520
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,490
half things actually been invoked here

521
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,350
on a certain web page so i can just sort

522
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,360
here and become we see that here we had

523
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,789
637 recalculations schedules for we had

524
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,200
leading light LED a layer of the

525
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,080
specific element here having the

526
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,230
possibility to drag back which call code

527
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,630
actually cost that layout thing to

528
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,669
happen it was just telling me before the

529
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:07,590
other things actually work how does

530
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,500
those things are going on here to do all

531
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,840
the way I do the real layout things that

532
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,220
really helps you to get an understanding

533
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,830
of its really going on in the pages from

534
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,169
actually quite different perspectives

535
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:21,270
and it's quite easy and straightforward

536
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,350
to resolve those problems so well that's

537
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,080
quite nice if you do it on your own

538
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,820
development machine if you're working on

539
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,620
your development machine but what

540
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,250
actually happens now if you want to send

541
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,440
this over to a colleague so what do you

542
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,780
do now so you know at the developer you

543
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,360
just realize that something

544
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,590
Kings are you getting back to people

545
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,140
that turn onto another develop to take

546
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,980
care of it what we've done here is we

547
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,679
simply side as soon as you close the

548
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,799
browser one other word now we see that

549
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,990
our session automatically gets stored

550
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:07,970
and which is can export it to a file and

551
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,010
make it available to other people just

552
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,750
sending it to them wire email so instead

553
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,120
of explaining to them what you actually

554
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,309
did on that page it would actually

555
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:21,320
happen you signing over right over it's

556
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,540
all this information and as you've seen

557
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,220
with all the function parameters are

558
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,990
things were called and then it can use

559
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,760
it to really analyze what's going on sir

560
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,540
it's especially helpful if you have your

561
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,760
end-users working with the back page and

562
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,140
telling you every clicking around the

563
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,650
baton has been slow cool now I know what

564
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,049
willing to look at ya so you see it just

565
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,790
started three if they'd see what's going

566
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,340
on there and then just send it over to

567
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,590
us and then a developer can analyze it

568
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,299
and have a look at the data that's

569
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:56,150
pretty much how you do the analysis here

570
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,669
on let's say and when you really have a

571
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:00,260
problem or would you want to investigate

572
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,059
what's going on in the page find out

573
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,600
what what's really happening here

574
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,020
another use case that we've seen is what

575
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,640
are you doing automated testing so you

576
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,260
have your water scribd you know if or

577
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,360
selenium scripts they do some functional

578
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,460
testing for you or do some automated

579
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,820
testing for you how can you collect this

580
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,410
kind of data they are able to might have

581
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,780
to read deep like it and see what's

582
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,860
going on especially if you're doing

583
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,600
testing and multiple browsers on

584
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,540
different platforms you want to like in

585
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,250
this case multiply Everson's you want to

586
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,929
see what's going on as I want to

587
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:34,910
automate the whole process what's what's

588
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,670
going on here

589
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,750
and therefore prepared a small sample

590
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:46,050
for you this case it's a water script so

591
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,700
what we're doing simply here which is

592
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,810
saying that we want to actually trace

593
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,440
for the specific water invocation and

594
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,730
additionally we have the possibility to

595
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,780
set specific marks in the code so see

596
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,640
okay this is what we were doing at that

597
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,830
point because especially if you're

598
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,540
running a longer test it might run for

599
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,880
10 minutes or so at some point

600
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,480
completely lose track what has happened

601
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,930
in the application now okay so you had

602
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,150
there was a problem in the past with if

603
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,510
you have when we updated feel XY sad

604
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,860
looking this up in its way Swilley can

605
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,660
get a real nightmare because when was

606
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,820
this happening it has good well he could

607
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,790
work with timelines but at the end it's

608
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,760
not really working well so you hear of

609
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,150
possibility to add additionally some

610
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,640
marks in here in the code so this was

611
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,650
I'm just loading the window here that

612
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,660
there was after loading the window then

613
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,180
typing here is ringing again and he

614
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,340
google it was after typing the string

615
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,880
and he'll click Submit and this was

616
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,560
after hitting the search then SEK what

617
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,060
kind of the page were really at what

618
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,640
kind of time so I'm just like executing

619
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:11,800
this now

620
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,460
so we see what we see in the background

621
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,550
it launches an Internet Explorer it's

622
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,410
going to the google page it's typing in

623
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,920
right ear here and at the same time we

624
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,779
start to record all events here

625
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:36,070
and if now have a look at the code oops

626
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,559
we get also our nice Marcus here because

627
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,360
of how long specific actions have been

628
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,909
taken say here is the UK that was after

629
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,710
loading the page so that's all the

630
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,940
loading stuff off the page that was all

631
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,769
the keyboard typing here without still

632
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:54,649
keyboard typing and that was as was

633
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:56,630
after typing the search string in here

634
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,620
and okay in case of submission just

635
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,299
realized that I was the other problem

636
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:03,740
submitting that page because there was

637
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,269
something changed they could be website

638
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,250
but nevertheless you see you cannot

639
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,659
attract those events especially in

640
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:13,730
script which makes it easier than if you

641
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,260
run into a certain problem to see what's

642
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,600
going on while also seeing what has been

643
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,450
going on before that time and

644
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,649
automatically stores this information

645
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:23,600
for you and after your ugly test runs

646
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,269
you automatically have available Otis

647
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:29,029
information for your diagnosis purposes

648
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:31,159
so whether you really want to go into

649
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:33,260
kind of a performance diagnosis approach

650
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,600
or its kind of post-mortem functional

651
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,299
debugging of your application the good

652
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,070
thing is it runs fully automated you

653
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,480
don't have to care about it and you just

654
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,750
get the results after your action test

655
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,980
ones so it was kind of a quick tour

656
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,480
through diner to raise HX edition I

657
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,809
think we could give you some overview

658
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:59,179
what what it can do for you if you

659
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:00,769
really want to find problems in the

660
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,480
Internet Explorer where the performance

661
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,000
related or functionally related those

662
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,350
who have been hunting down problems in

663
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,750
Internet Explorer probably know that

664
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,620
it's not that easy set a tool is

665
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,690
completely free so you can download it

666
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,190
and use it as you like just go to a

667
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,970
website and have look at it so we're

668
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,039
currently in version oh that's really

669
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,269
somebody I've seen as the orders we

670
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:30,679
version of our for a tool here we have

671
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,120
always been using it in a couple of

672
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,769
real-world examples and real-world

673
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:35,970
websites and we were quite

674
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,680
also other people like their tools if

675
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,350
you don't believe us for example Steve

676
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,090
Soros has already used the tool and I

677
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,860
was blocked about it he's also round you

678
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,360
can ask him have you seen the good two

679
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,030
of those guys you like it if you don't

680
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,370
trust us you might resume and more than

681
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,160
us a lot of photos I've tried it as well

682
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,810
we don't want to mention the website

683
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,760
that said okay just have a look at us

684
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,780
because we have some performance

685
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,880
problems you know that's not so good for

686
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,730
them yeah but this version of all rights

687
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,850
we are constantly evolving the tool

688
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,770
adding new functionalities if you go to

689
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,360
the website as a forum you can post

690
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,150
commands questions and get in touch with

691
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,580
us the zebra version order three at the

692
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,910
moment but we rock so we always have

693
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,620
solved couple of real-world problems

694
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,350
with the tool people find it useful

695
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,120
covers quite a broad range of things

696
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,610
that you wanted you and web performance

697
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,740
analysis that's actually the feedback we

698
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,840
got if you're using Internet Explorer

699
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,870
already asked you check it out give it a

700
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,580
try when you are into problems see what

701
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,740
if you can find yes you can download it

702
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,900
from a check the diner twitter com is to

703
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,780
form their old information contact

704
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,860
details for us as well so you can easily

705
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,310
get in touch with us and find out what

706
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,760
the tool can do for you as well you can

707
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,550
get in touch with me so i dub I email

708
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:05,470
we're a block or wire Twitter so I'm one

709
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,660
of the guys being responsible for

710
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,030
pushing a sixth edition forwards here

711
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,640
give feedback try it out and see what he

712
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:20,710
can do for you any questions yeah

713
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,850
yes 678

714
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,400
yes and other platforms are on a road

715
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,050
map but initially we have chosen to

716
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,480
support internet explorer because we've

717
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,010
seen their first of all most of the

718
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,179
problems coming up and especially for a

719
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:48,370
bigger enterprise applications most of

720
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,290
them running in Internet Explorer

721
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,940
secondly there's no retooling for

722
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,300
internet explorer I know most developers

723
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,970
like to use Safari and like to use

724
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,500
Firefox so we're planning to support

725
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,059
those platforms as well but for the

726
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:07,090
moment we focused on IE but it is on our

727
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,559
roadmap to support other platforms as

728
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:21,810
well as a tool

729
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,559
you will have to have them installed

730
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,720
because what we are just doing we're

731
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,690
just actually putting an Asian as a

732
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,820
plug-in into the browser and just see

733
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,020
what the browser is actually doing so

734
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,460
it's not kind of a browser emulation

735
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,050
thing or whatever it's really

736
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,400
intercepting what the browser is fully

737
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,470
doing and then you can't ask them and

738
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,540
using those process but as soon as you

739
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,070
have it install it will work in all of

740
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:56,860
those web browsers
