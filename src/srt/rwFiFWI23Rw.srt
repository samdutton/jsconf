[Music]

2
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,430
good morning so first of all before I

3
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,900
start I really want to thank everybody

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,029
involved in making Jesco aphasia happen

5
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,580
for having me and for really organizing

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,340
a really cool event so far and thank all

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,170
of you for being here this morning it

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,550
might be a bit early for some of you so

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,100
thanks for coming here to listen to me

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,300
talk about machine learning for

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,820
front-end developers so before I stop

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,250
I've given this talk a couple of times

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,100
before and the feedback or comment I

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,469
usually get is that I speak very fast so

15
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,570
I'm gonna try to be mindful and slow

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,360
down a little bit on some slides but I

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,370
get really excited about sharing what I

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,920
know with you so my natural pace always

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,670
comes back and also I mean I'd like to

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,809
remind you that we're in a fast-paced

21
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,730
industry so I'm not you know I'm not

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,470
fast you're slow so I'm kidding I

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,930
already want to try but um so my name is

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,479
Charlie Jerrod I am a developer at a

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,430
product company called Atlassian in

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,740
Sydney and outside of that in the

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,020
community I'm also part of two tech

28
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,610
community programs called Google

29
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,229
developer experts and Mozilla Tech

30
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,060
speakers if you're interested in

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,200
learning more about what it is I know

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,409
that there's a few others here as well

33
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:29,610
so there's you know quite a few

34
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,799
community of people sharing knowledge

35
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,420
through conferences and blog posts and

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,939
workshops and things like that but I'm

37
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,979
not here to talk about that I'm here to

38
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,799
talk about machine learning so usually I

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,360
start because I don't know what you know

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,770
and what you don't know so I usually

41
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,509
start with an example to try to put

42
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,159
everybody on the same level about what

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,470
machine learning is but yesterday I

44
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,850
think Monica did a very nice

45
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,810
introduction

46
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,460
talking about how to recognize our

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,140
pictures of cats and dogs and I thought

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,939
that was really simple and well done so

49
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,950
I kind of removed some of my slides and

50
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,009
I'm just gonna briefly say if you were

51
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,020
not here or if you you know don't

52
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,060
remember that is basically giving the

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,009
ability to computers to find patterns in

54
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,690
in data without being explicitly

55
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,000
programmed so if I just take back the

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,460
example from Monica yesterday the

57
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,780
time that your computer sees a picture

58
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,700
of a cat it doesn't really know what it

59
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,250
is it's never seen one before but you

60
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,870
know by giving it millions of samples of

61
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,420
data of what a cat looks like in a dog

62
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,510
looks like using algorithms and machine

63
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,670
learning models the computer is able to

64
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,950
understand to find patterns in what

65
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,020
makes a cat a cat on a picture and what

66
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,780
makes a dog a dog so at a high level

67
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,110
this is basically that so at the core of

68
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,510
a is machine learning models and to

69
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,250
build a model you need algorithms so

70
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,310
let's dive a little bit into this so if

71
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,320
you start looking into machine learning

72
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,910
you might come across some of these

73
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,820
algorithms so I know that I when I

74
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,740
started I definitely heard a lot about

75
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,380
naive Bayes and K nearest neighbor and

76
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,750
there's really a lot of them and they're

77
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,010
good at solving different types of

78
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,720
problems and dealing with different

79
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,330
types of data so before even looking

80
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,370
into what algorithm you want to use you

81
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,960
have to understand what type of problem

82
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,540
that you want to solve so there's three

83
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,760
main types of problem problems in

84
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,740
machine learning you have supervised

85
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,420
learning unsupervised learning and

86
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,150
reinforcement learning for this talk and

87
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,380
knowing that I only have half an hour

88
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm only gonna cover supervised and

89
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,750
unsupervised also because a lot of the

90
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,580
time when you get started the problems

91
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,260
that you'll want to try and solve can be

92
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,420
solved with supervised and unsupervised

93
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,220
so at first maybe don't bother with

94
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,400
understanding what reinforcement is so

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,920
let's start with supervised learning if

96
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,720
we start with a Britisher definition

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,570
it's basically creating a predictive

98
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,400
model based on a set of features and

99
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,220
labels and there's three main terms in

100
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,330
this definition that you need to

101
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,250
understand it's you know what is the

102
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,150
predictive model

103
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,930
what's features and what's a label so I

104
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,400
don't know about you but I learned more

105
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,650
when I can kind of like relate to

106
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,020
examples so a classic example of a

107
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,460
supervised learning problem is

108
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,310
predicting the price of a house so let's

109
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,410
imagine you know we're in Singapore we

110
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,450
have a house if we're lucky enough that

111
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,049
we want to be able to sell and but we

112
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,190
don't know how much we should sell it

113
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,440
for for it to you know for us to make

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,150
profit and you know sell it fast and

115
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,669
things like that but what we have is a

116
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,200
lot of data of all the houses in

117
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,600
Singapore and that's what we have so we

118
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,290
start with that so

119
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,360
how can we predict the price of our

120
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,430
house based on the price of houses in

121
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,920
the market so the labels in that case is

122
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,090
the price it's what you're actually

123
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,850
trying to predict so in your data set

124
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,190
that you're going to put together it's

125
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,440
how you would classify each entry so as

126
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,880
our problem is trying to predict the

127
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,650
price we would have if you you know

128
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,660
imagine an Excel spreadsheet we would

129
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,670
have a column with all the prices of all

130
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,640
the houses in Singapore and then we

131
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,680
would have our features and features are

132
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,510
the characteristics of the entries in

133
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,000
your data set so for houses it would be

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,610
the number of floors the number of rooms

135
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,560
bathrooms that you'd have a garden or

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,360
know the neighborhood and things like

137
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,350
that and using these labels and features

138
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,810
we're using an algorithm you would try

139
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,130
to understand the correlation between

140
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,830
the features and the price so the

141
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,270
characteristic and the price of a house

142
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,200
to generate a model that can then and

143
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,940
being a mathematical representation of

144
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,260
the outcome of your training

145
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,910
so using everything that you know about

146
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,190
the house is you use algorithms that end

147
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,140
up being like a function that takes new

148
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,490
parameters of a new house it's never

149
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,370
seen before and it's able to generate a

150
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,890
prediction of a price that the house

151
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,600
should go for based on all the houses

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,420
that it's seen on the market so it's

153
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,380
important to know that supervised

154
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,720
learning needs labels and features to

155
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,150
generate a predictive model and then if

156
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,980
we look at a type another type of

157
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,900
learning the unsupervised learning it's

158
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,120
the ability to create predictions based

159
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,100
only on a set of features and the end of

160
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,480
the definition is really important

161
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,460
because it's the main difference between

162
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,190
unsupervised and supervised so if we

163
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,810
think about our problem of predicting

164
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,520
the price of a house it wouldn't really

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,500
work as an it's not an unsupervised

166
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,390
problem how can you understand how can

167
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,950
you predict the price of a house if you

168
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,170
have never even seen what a price is you

169
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,090
only know the characteristics of a house

170
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,480
so in that particular case a type of

171
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
problem that unsupervised learning

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,260
solves is more around clustering so an

173
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,060
example of that would be predicting

174
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,730
customer behavior so when you go to the

175
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,410
supermarket they might not know who you

176
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,230
are at all but based on what you buy how

177
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,680
often how expensive it is where they can

178
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,140
actually really cluster people together

179
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,760
into different categories and base

180
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,610
on your buying behavior they wouldn't be

181
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,590
able to know what advertising to send to

182
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,300
you because you're more likely to buy

183
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,430
the same thing that people like you have

184
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,310
bought as well so so unsupervised

185
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,870
learning is more around clustering

186
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,240
rather than getting a particular answer

187
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,050
out of a question so in this - so now

188
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,100
that we talked about the types of

189
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,510
learning I talked about you know

190
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,740
problems that you're predicting the

191
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,390
price of a house or customer behavior

192
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,950
but it might not be something that you

193
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,290
want to do and yesterday in Monica's

194
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,210
talk we saw that machine learning can be

195
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,790
used in a lot of more creative ways so

196
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,460
let's talk briefly about different

197
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,390
applications I just put like a short

198
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,340
list together and the first one I'm

199
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,170
going to talk about is this example here

200
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,260
where you upload a picture of a cat and

201
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,870
then an algorithm generates for you a

202
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,180
piece of text that you can use as alt

203
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,150
text for your image tags in your HTML so

204
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,130
this experiment was built by I'm sorry

205
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,750
Dresner I put the link there if you want

206
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,210
to try it a bit later but so maybe for

207
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,580
one image my Billa oh I can do it myself

208
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,280
but when you like you can see that using

209
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,780
machine learning can maybe eventually

210
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,060
automate some of the things that we do

211
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,710
as developers so we can actually spend

212
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,410
time solving some of the logic that we

213
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,540
want to solve so that's just like a

214
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,270
quick example another one that would

215
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,530
have been really useful for me a few

216
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,530
years ago was it's this framework called

217
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,410
not-safe-for-work j/s where again you

218
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,220
upload a picture in in this little

219
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,440
experiment here and it gives you the

220
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,270
probability of it being an image that is

221
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,880
not safe for work and I used to work in

222
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,090
advertising and when you work for brands

223
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,590
sometimes they want to put competitions

224
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,290
together where they want to engage with

225
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,360
customers so people have to upload a

226
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,000
selfie or whatever to win a contest so

227
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,470
people who produce a lot of images and

228
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,080
most of the time they the brain wants to

229
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,090
see the images live in a gallery or

230
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,490
whatever and the thing is that the check

231
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,260
that you have to do to make sure that

232
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,540
these images are okay they usually done

233
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,849
manually either by like a product

234
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,150
manager or or by the developers so using

235
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,190
machine learning in the front end you

236
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,960
could actually do a pre-check of what

237
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,940
people are uploading before saving into

238
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,530
the database and before displaying it

239
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,130
live

240
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,440
on a page so that's definitely something

241
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,389
I could have used a few years ago so I

242
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:57,399
thought it was very interesting and then

243
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,100
like another example that is really

244
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,230
really like totally like awesome

245
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,730
I got really loved it because it mixes a

246
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,430
lot of different technologies and it can

247
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,600
actually help people in terms of

248
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,130
accessibility so I don't know if you've

249
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,500
seen this one but this developer called

250
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,069
Abhishek Singh created a prototype

251
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:17,500
around the concept of kind of like

252
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,079
future interactions so he was thinking

253
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,569
about if no voice UI when you talk to

254
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:24,910
Amazon Alexa what about people who can't

255
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,430
talk are they are we just gonna

256
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,079
literally cut them out of you know

257
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:30,250
innovation and things like that

258
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,920
so what he decided to do is to use

259
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,500
machine learning in JavaScript to look

260
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,740
at the to capture data from the webcam

261
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,959
feed train and algorithm to recognize

262
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,779
and gestures map them to words so he

263
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:46,089
could actually communicate with Alexa

264
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,970
just via via gestures like by training

265
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,620
and algorithm so I thought it was really

266
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,720
a creative way and a really interesting

267
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,519
way of using machine learning in

268
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,329
JavaScript so let's dive a little bit

269
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,010
into instead of just talking about what

270
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,800
you can do let's have a look a little

271
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,860
bit about first of all why because when

272
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,970
you think about machine learning

273
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,470
you probably think about Python before

274
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,480
you think about JavaScript but I think

275
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,889
it's really interesting to now be able

276
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:13,510
to do that in JavaScript because in

277
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,130
terms of learning curve it's a lot

278
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,829
easier for developers to know that they

279
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:19,690
only have to understand a few concepts

280
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,329
of machine learning and and understand

281
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:24,579
the syntax of a certain framework rather

282
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:26,199
than having to learn an entirely new

283
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:29,949
language we learn new syntax like every

284
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:32,290
day when we move from jQuery to angular

285
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,420
to view to react so we kind of used to

286
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,069
doing that and now it's just

287
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,019
transferring that skill of being you

288
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,050
know adaptable to another domain so I

289
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,519
really love the fact that is you don't

290
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,990
have to be a data scientist you don't

291
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,160
have to only know Python

292
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,050
it's actually out there and you can

293
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,449
start doing it now and now the point

294
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,889
that I think is important is around

295
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,380
rapid prototyping so I really love doing

296
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,019
that it's you know like this what I'm

297
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:57,610
talking about is has nothing to do with

298
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,620
what I do for work so all of my

299
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,600
experiments are things that I do outside

300
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,420
you know after work you know yeah

301
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,610
or on the weekend so sometimes when I

302
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,470
want to validate an idea I need it to be

303
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,930
fast because I don't want to spend like

304
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,040
I'm not that patient so I don't want to

305
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,930
spend six months on a project I usually

306
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,170
want span like two hours so being able

307
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,779
to to prototype something fast in

308
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,220
JavaScript is really cool because if you

309
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,290
want to just you know if you have an

310
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,990
idea in mind and often if you want to be

311
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,940
given the time or the money at work to

312
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,440
explore it more you have to convince

313
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,149
people that it's worth it and to be able

314
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,800
to convince them usually you have to

315
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,380
show them something some kind of MVP or

316
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,220
approve of concept and and your being

317
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,269
able to do machine learning in

318
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,220
JavaScript means that you could validate

319
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,170
an idea and then eventually move to

320
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,790
Python if you want to push it further

321
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,160
but I think that's one of the really

322
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,420
awesome thing that I like about

323
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,000
JavaScript and then finally there is a

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,949
bigger and bigger ecosystem of tools

325
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:55,779
that you can use in JavaScript and

326
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,430
there's more and more documentation

327
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,350
there's a lot of tutorials and courses

328
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,389
so I think it's a good time to get

329
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,620
started if you want to get into that

330
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,040
space so what can you do so you can do

331
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,079
three things first of all you can import

332
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,990
an existing pre-trained model so it's a

333
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,430
model that has already been trained with

334
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,019
a lot of data for a specific purpose and

335
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:16,000
you can just import it in your app and

336
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,540
use it as is you can also do you can

337
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,730
also retrain and earn important model

338
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,320
that we call transfer learning so you

339
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,269
kind of do the same thing from the step

340
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,250
one you can you can use a model that is

341
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,110
open source but you can as you you can

342
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,209
add your own samples on top of it and

343
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,550
kind of retrain that ready fast and then

344
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,290
finally you can do all of it in

345
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,180
javascript in the browser you can define

346
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,149
train and run your model entirely in the

347
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:43,600
browser so in terms of tools I think the

348
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,060
most popular is tensorflow j/s but

349
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,790
sometimes I feel like some of the terms

350
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,130
that tensorflow gest uses might be a bit

351
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,110
confusing for people who is just getting

352
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,880
started so I really like the second one

353
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,149
on the right ml 5gs the it's a framework

354
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:01,449
that tries to abstract some of the terms

355
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,160
like you know it's trust to make it

356
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,360
really really easy for you to get

357
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,519
started so it's a lot simpler and

358
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,079
there's a few examples I feel like it's

359
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,910
not it's still kind of like in

360
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,670
construction there's some examples and

361
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,410
some algorithms that work but sometimes

362
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,449
when you look at the docs you can see

363
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:17,379
that it's stealing

364
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,319
yes but definitely have a look and then

365
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:21,879
if you don't really want to write any

366
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,799
code but you just wanna pings on api's

367
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,809
you can leverage the tools from Amazon

368
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:29,709
Google and Microsoft and then the em in

369
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,649
the middle is for yes so now if you were

370
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,119
here yesterday you know what that is but

371
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:36,429
yes so it's like some some frameworks

372
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:37,749
are actually more specialized about

373
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:39,549
certain type of data and to do certain

374
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:44,709
things okay so we are at this part where

375
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,919
I'm going to do some demos and code

376
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,659
because I feel like to get people on

377
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:52,209
board sometimes you know you can't just

378
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:53,439
say oh it's easy you kind of have to

379
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:55,929
hopefully show that it's easy so people

380
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,539
are a bit more comfortable so to get

381
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:01,059
started I'm gonna talk about the quick

382
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:03,549
demo that I built around using a pre

383
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:08,409
trained model so what I did so I I want

384
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:11,379
to get better at recycling but I always

385
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:13,089
forget what should go in

386
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:15,489
what bin so that is not really helpful

387
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,970
when you want to recycle so I wanted to

388
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,989
see if I could use machine learning to

389
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,909
help me do that you know kind of do it

390
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:24,369
automatically so I'm gonna demo out what

391
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:26,079
I did in an hour show the code so this

392
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,299
demo is supposed to I kind of built it

393
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,129
usually to be used on a phone so I could

394
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:32,739
just like move around the desktop like

395
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,269
it's working because it's a website but

396
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:41,529
let me just all right so I'm gonna start

397
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,029
it's gonna need the camera feed and I

398
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:49,829
have a rest sticker hiding my camera I

399
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:59,709
need to buy myself for real okay so if

400
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,109
you've ever alright so I have the camera

401
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,339
feed so you have to imagine that you

402
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:04,299
have it on the phone and it's not

403
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:06,369
pointing at you but so I just have like

404
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:08,139
a button that here that says you know is

405
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,359
this recyclable so it works well with

406
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:14,439
bottles of water so so I'm going to put

407
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:27,069
it my microphone down because I need so

408
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,050
it is

409
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,910
[Laughter]

410
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,020
so then on my phone I would click yes it

411
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,550
is a bottle and then it says oh it is

412
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,560
recyclable 3 in the yellow bin so in

413
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,090
Australia it's yellow actually didn't

414
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:43,230
check here if it was yellow oh well ok

415
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,350
so you can you can start again with

416
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,910
different objects and I'm gonna exit

417
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,500
this because I don't need to see myself

418
00:15:51,500 --> 00:16:00,390
so and and and yeah and so it does the

419
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,610
whole image recognition using machine

420
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,470
learning and then you could imagine that

421
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,840
you could build an API that you know you

422
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,880
can just ping to say hey this object

423
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,710
which bin should it go in and things

424
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,980
like that so in terms of code I used the

425
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,410
kuku SSD open source model that's an

426
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,990
object detection model and then I import

427
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,290
tensorflow J's as well then you load the

428
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,470
model to be able to use it then you get

429
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,190
the camera element from the HTML and you

430
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,840
use some of the tensorflow built-in

431
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,240
methods to look at the pixels of that

432
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,360
camera feed you transform the data so

433
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,190
that it can be in the format that

434
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,810
tensorflow and the model is expecting

435
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,880
and then finally you kind of give that

436
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,160
processed image to the model and you ask

437
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,630
it for predictions it's kind of like

438
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,950
here's the de Graaff from the webcam

439
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,630
feed have you seen this before do you

440
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,630
know what this is and it recognized that

441
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,620
you know my bottle so of course you know

442
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,820
there's a bit more code around like the

443
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,620
UI and buttons and things but just to be

444
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,690
able to recognize images using that

445
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,520
model that's basically just it you load

446
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,860
the model you get the data from the

447
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,690
camera feed and then you transform it a

448
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,430
little bit and you ask the model you

449
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,220
know can you detect this so at the first

450
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,100
thing of importing a pre-training model

451
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,010
that's it so now let's talk about

452
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,360
transfer learning so transfer learning

453
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,510
as I said before is using a pre trained

454
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,490
model by adding your own samples so for

455
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,190
this one I so I like to try and play

456
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,630
around with new technologies and mixing

457
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,480
them with accessibility so I'm just

458
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,320
gonna launch the oh I'm still here okay

459
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,500
so this one is gonna use the camera as

460
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,190
well so say the camera feed is gonna be

461
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,760
really small but there's

462
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,020
for that like you're not supposed to see

463
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,720
it I just showed it so so you would see

464
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,940
the what's going on but okay so I'm

465
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,670
gonna go to the right I'm adding samples

466
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,040
I'm gonna go to the left I'm gonna go

467
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:00,940
down then I am testing okay down lift

468
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,520
right that's pretty good and then I'm

469
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,530
able to actually unless like you know

470
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,360
what 30 seconds I trained a model to

471
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,790
recognize my hand movement my head

472
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:25,160
gestures and I can write like why

473
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,400
all right so I really like this is like

474
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,800
my favorite feature of using javascript

475
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,870
for machine learning and in terms of

476
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,250
code so there's a little bit more code

477
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,740
that I can't go too much into it because

478
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,940
I'm looking at the time and I think I'm

479
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,790
gonna be over time but I'm loading

480
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,920
another kind of like image recognition

481
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,860
model called mobile net I'm again

482
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,230
loading tensorflow GS but I'm also

483
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,060
adding a classifier because I need to

484
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,430
kind of reclassify my my personal

485
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,640
samples with the model then you just

486
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,440
declare some variables I have four

487
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,180
classes that I'm trying to classify

488
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,070
because I had four gestures but it could

489
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,110
be you know the number that you want the

490
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,950
image size of 227 that is hard-coded I

491
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,990
started that from an example I think

492
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,410
it's because the bigger the image the

493
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,820
longer it's going to take to train so I

494
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,770
think if you want it to be fast then 27

495
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,040
is fine the top K is the K value for K

496
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,230
nearest neighbor that is kind of

497
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,850
arbitrary as well you can change it I

498
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,470
can't go too much into what the

499
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,180
algorithm actually does but this value

500
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,570
is needed but it doesn't have to be ten

501
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,160
but then so the more interesting part is

502
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,260
we create the classifier you load your

503
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,660
module then you do the same thing as

504
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,190
before you look at the data coming from

505
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,440
the camera feed but instead of giving it

506
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,660
straight to the model you kind of have

507
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,390
to like I did with what's going on with

508
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,090
the model that you loaded so I'm not

509
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,280
exactly sure exactly what the infamous

510
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,960
that does before what I understand it

511
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,990
kind of merges your image data from the

512
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,910
browser

513
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,160
to the mobile net module and then it

514
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,539
adds all of this to the K nearest

515
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,130
neighbor classifier that you are created

516
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,230
before and then you're able to predict

517
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,860
the class of your new samples based on

518
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,570
this merge of the model and your

519
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,429
personal samples so then you kind of get

520
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:11,520
a prediction of your current position in

521
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,539
my personal sample like type and yeah

522
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:16,890
that's it so that was a very poor

523
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,140
explanation but in terms of steps you

524
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,789
create a classifier you load the module

525
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,590
you look again at the data coming from

526
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,780
the webcam you kind of do the merge and

527
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,909
you ask your model to predict and then

528
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:28,740
finally you can dispose of the images

529
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,990
that you got from your webcam because

530
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,460
you kind of already retrained the

531
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,070
classifier so you don't need to keep it

532
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,210
so that was for transfer learning and

533
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,750
then finally doing everything in

534
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,419
transcript so for this one this demo I'm

535
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,909
always a little bit nervous because I

536
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:45,870
don't know how people are gonna take it

537
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,780
but yesterday somebody mentioned pornhub

538
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,960
on stage I think I'm fine

539
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,350
what I built is a wheelie detector so

540
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,380
we're gonna stay on the same level if

541
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,030
you don't know what a wheelie is a

542
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,230
wheelie is a penis but it's not pictures

543
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,280
I'm not crazy

544
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,559
so and also I'm really not interested in

545
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,809
pictures of this so I'm just gonna

546
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,809
launch it quickly I'm just I mean if you

547
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:15,740
just go stop this it was still going

548
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,520
well there's a bit small but that should

549
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,370
be alright so basically I build

550
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,679
something from scratch that recognized

551
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:23,669
I'm gonna start with something you know

552
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,330
like safe OOP so it's a Kindle just

553
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,419
think if that's the Kindle and if I

554
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,159
predict it tells me it's not a really is

555
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,039
that yes it's not a wheelie and then I

556
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,669
can clear a and do I need no I don't

557
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:44,040
need two hands for this so

558
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:50,410
and Willie okay and what I forgot to say

559
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,510
I forgot to talk about why I built this

560
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,450
because I don't just spend my spare time

561
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,480
drawing release so I built this because

562
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,980
I wanted to build something else where I

563
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,170
wanted to let people collaborate on the

564
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,360
browser you know using WebSockets from

565
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,670
like anywhere in the world but I you

566
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,050
when you let people draw stuff on the

567
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,730
Internet you can be sure that they're

568
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,260
gonna be trying Willy's and I didn't

569
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,640
want to spend my time checking you know

570
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,050
what are people drawing and then

571
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,460
deleting it and stuff like that so

572
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,350
that's my way of using machine learning

573
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,720
to do that for me so at the moment you

574
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,550
know like I have to click to be able to

575
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,470
predict if it's really or not but you

576
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,780
can actually change the code to detect

577
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,630
as somebody is drawing so I mean you

578
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,860
would you wouldn't even have time to

579
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,380
finish the woolie would be gone so I

580
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,580
still haven't been on that project but

581
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,130
I'm still happy with that so now let's

582
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,090
talk about how I put it together okay so

583
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,640
first of all and because when you do

584
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,900
yeah I know and that's the only thing

585
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,700
people remember from the talk so so

586
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,890
because okay so when you build when you

587
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,660
do everything from scratch you usually

588
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,550
have to kind of you have you need data

589
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,860
right so on the right you have the quick

590
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,540
road that I said that Google put

591
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,190
together where they there was a game

592
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,200
online where people could were asked to

593
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,640
draw I don't know a strawberry and a

594
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,220
door and glasses and actually all these

595
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,140
samples were downloaded so they were

596
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,360
actually saved in a database and Google

597
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,640
put this data set open source so you can

598
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,590
use it the thing is obviously Google did

599
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,660
not ask people to draw Willie's but I

600
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,510
needed them for my you know for my

601
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,220
prototype because if it doesn't know

602
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,390
what it really is it can't tell me if

603
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,610
it's one enough so I drew some of them

604
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,320
definitely know as many as the data set

605
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,290
because that's like millions but so I

606
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,750
needed that so I needed to have data

607
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,210
together the thing is that when I drew

608
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,940
my own

609
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,000
but so when I drew it on the canvas on

610
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,220
the in the browser it was 200 by 200

611
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,440
pixels but the images in the data set

612
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,480
were 28 by 28 so for me to be able to

613
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,400
work with them usually have to do some

614
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,119
kind of data processing where you have

615
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,219
you resize so that the whole data set is

616
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:59,279
the same size of pixels and then finally

617
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,769
finally next you do you split between

618
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:03,869
the training set and the test set where

619
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:06,059
it's usually 80% and 20% and the reason

620
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,369
why you do that is because you uses 80%

621
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,259
of your data set to train your models so

622
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:11,789
it kind of understands is it a wheelie

623
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:14,909
or is it candle and then your test data

624
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:16,859
that is already labeled you already know

625
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,959
what each image is you use that to

626
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,299
against your model that you created to

627
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,939
see if the accuracy is right and if it's

628
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:25,109
not right you know that you have to

629
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:28,139
retrain but then after you split your

630
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:29,729
data then you can choose your algorithm

631
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:31,619
I don't really think there's a purpose

632
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:34,619
to choose it before but I in this

633
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:36,539
particular case I used what we call the

634
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,879
CNN convolutional neural network because

635
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:41,639
from what I read it was with images so

636
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:44,279
you know I have images then you can do

637
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,359
some parameter tuning you train you get

638
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,429
your prediction and depending on you

639
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:51,689
know the level of accuracy if you're

640
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,519
happy or not with it you kind of repeat

641
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,499
these steps over and over again you will

642
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:57,779
rarely get a very good accuracy the

643
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,599
first time parameter tuning is kind of

644
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,549
like weird as well like you yeah you

645
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,949
don't really understand sometimes why

646
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:06,899
changing a parameter makes the accuracy

647
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:08,219
better but you kind of have to play

648
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:11,219
around with it so in terms of code I'm

649
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,139
gonna show like a really small code

650
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:15,329
sample I try to get like the core bits

651
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:17,699
of it but what you have to do intensive

652
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:19,829
flow you have to create tenses which is

653
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:22,199
basically like the way a way to shape

654
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,849
the data so that tensorflow will

655
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:26,009
understand how to deal with it and as I

656
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:27,539
said you have to create a training set

657
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:31,169
and a test set and then you create your

658
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:33,179
model so I have a sequential model and I

659
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,629
add layers of a convolutional 2d layer

660
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:38,909
and then you add different layers as

661
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:41,459
well I don't have time to really go into

662
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:44,009
this in depth but also the amount of

663
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,539
layer is it a bit arbitrary some time we

664
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,279
can remove some add some see how it

665
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,289
performs the parameters meaning that I

666
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:51,029
was talking about is what you see like

667
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,429
kernel size and filters that's a little

668
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:55,319
bit more of a like an art than a science

669
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,249
you kind of see what works then you get

670
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:00,599
your training data you do what we call

671
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,639
fittings so you give that training data

672
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,889
in labels to the model you pass it a few

673
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:06,169
parameters and

674
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:07,309
and what you do is that you get your

675
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:09,200
taste data and you test it against the

676
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,799
model so using them the testing data you

677
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,179
give it to the model you get the

678
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:17,239
prediction and if you get the right

679
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,950
label that you're expecting then it

680
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,499
means that it's fine if you want to look

681
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:22,879
into this the documentation for

682
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:26,600
tensorflow J's is actually really good

683
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,850
a few limits very quickly so you need a

684
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,169
large amount of data if you're not using

685
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:32,749
a pre trained model you know as we

686
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:34,159
talked about before for a computer to

687
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,359
understand what something is usually

688
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,809
needs millions of samples it can take a

689
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:40,369
lot of time to train your own model

690
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:42,080
depending on what you're trying to do

691
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,609
especially if you're I think dealing

692
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:46,239
with images it can take a lot of time I

693
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:48,109
remember to think about the mobile

694
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:51,049
experience because when I was playing

695
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:53,090
with loading like importing a pre train

696
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,950
model some models can be a few megabytes

697
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,859
and that kind of hurts so if you're on

698
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:00,080
like a low network it's gonna be really

699
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,690
impossible and even in terms of using

700
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,090
the battery of a mobile device it can be

701
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,070
quite expensive so just you know think

702
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,179
about that if you try to develop

703
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:11,809
something liability sometimes when you

704
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:13,669
use machine learning models you actually

705
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:14,840
don't understand what's going on in the

706
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,600
background so if you decide to use

707
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,220
machine learning to build an application

708
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,350
who decides who gets alone or who gets

709
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,499
into what expensive school or whatever

710
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:25,850
you have to be sure that if you tell

711
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,739
somebody that they can't get a loan or

712
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:29,570
that they can't get accepted and they

713
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,039
sue you you can't just say oh we use

714
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,289
machine learning so I don't know you

715
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:34,789
have to just be able to explain what

716
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:36,619
happened and most of the time people

717
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:37,909
don't know well I definitely don't know

718
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:40,700
and then finally and really opponent Lee

719
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,259
even if you're not interested in coding

720
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:44,389
machine learning the topic of bias and

721
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:46,519
ethics in AI is like super interesting

722
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,249
and I just like to mention often the

723
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:51,499
algorithms are not biased we are I feel

724
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:53,869
like we love to push the responsibility

725
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:55,429
on a piece of code and not just like

726
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:58,970
look at what we do wrong so remember

727
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,700
algorithms is just code and the reason

728
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,470
why we say it's biased is because of the

729
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,690
data that we give it and the data that

730
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,450
we give it is something that we produce

731
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,919
so just a quick example here this was

732
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,309
already a few years ago so I hope they

733
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:15,139
fixed it now though if you if you use

734
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:17,389
before Google translates with some

735
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:19,400
languages are gender neutral and

736
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,470
if you translate some languages it to

737
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,910
English then all of a sudden it becomes

738
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,420
gendered where you have things like he

739
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,120
is hardworking and she's lazy like all

740
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,340
of a sudden his gendered I'm not lazy I

741
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,960
mean you know she's a cook he's an

742
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,830
engineer that's the worst so it's that

743
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,120
kind of stuff it's like and then you had

744
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,250
articles around oh you know a Google

745
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,740
Translate is sexist it's like well what

746
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,170
do you think it's the data from so I

747
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,580
think it's just remember I mean I do

748
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,160
think that machine learning can help us

749
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,840
recognize some of our biases and then

750
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,550
help us you know be better but the

751
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:56,000
algorithm itself is not the problem okay

752
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm getting to the end of my talk so the

753
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,160
story about that one is that so I gave

754
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,150
this talk I'm just looked at the unicorn

755
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,660
so I gave this took a few weeks ago in

756
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,330
Lithuania and a few like just a day

757
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,770
before or a few days before I had

758
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,940
finished the prototype that I was

759
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,440
building that I was like super excited

760
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,120
about that involved machine learning and

761
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,429
JavaScript and I wanted to show the

762
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:21,770
world but as I showed it well now for

763
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,700
some people it's not a surprise anymore

764
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,940
but um I thought that if I didn't show

765
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,010
it here it would be unfair so I'm gonna

766
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,400
show it as well and and yeah it's a toy

767
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,050
it's supposed to be a topic for a talk

768
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,030
later this year but it is related

769
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,679
because it uses machine learning so I

770
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:37,820
hope it's gonna work so the inspiration

771
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,050
for this is so this is a prototype built

772
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,450
by a developer called Minko Jewish who

773
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,880
used the webcam feed to train their

774
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,070
algorithm to recognize some gestures to

775
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,190
then apply it to a game - so to be able

776
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,010
to have this personalized experience of

777
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,660
of playing a game the thing I was

778
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,730
thinking though is that well you have to

779
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,920
be in front of the webcam so what if all

780
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,450
of sudden it's dark you can't play

781
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,340
anymore so there was a bit of a shame as

782
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,080
I'm home I think I can do something

783
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,800
about it so I'm gonna try I need to

784
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,900
remember what I have to do I think I

785
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,870
have it ready let me think

786
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,220
I'm gonna have some water if you don't

787
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:44,799
mind

788
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:48,419
right hopefully is going to work so

789
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,610
preaching said that we could use the

790
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:55,190
unicorn so I'm gonna use the

791
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,490
it's me and you now unicorn they can

792
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,030
only be one a rainbow on this stage so

793
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,770
lemme try something I'm the one on the

794
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:11,120
round in red okay it didn't work okay

795
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,210
wait

796
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:28,880
[Music]

797
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,530
oh I just like to do that mister

[Music]

801
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:50,850
I love how the music you play okay

802
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,669
[Music]

803
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:58,360
No okay I'll give it one last try this

804
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,770
is what happens when you get shitty for

805
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,210
the guys in two hours

806
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,280

807
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,680
Apple pencil who is using an Apple

pencil

809

[Music]

810
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:17,260
you ruined my demo one last time

811
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,010
no I will not get off this stage until

812
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:25,720
it works I'm sorry for the speaker after

813
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,430
me all right I swear

814
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,650
okay is somebody using bluetooth and

815
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,860
they're like that was working this

816
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,140
[Music]

817
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,160
don't let me down

818
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:47,160
[Music]

819
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:54,080
alright let me just

820
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,790
it's not the way to end

821
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:15,820
[Music]

822
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,840
yes

823
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:26,390
[Music]

824
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:26,550
[Applause]

825
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:32,619
[Music]

826
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:37,309
this was like one of my worst life ever

827
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:40,769
all right so just very very briefly I

828
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,470
wish I wish we just like yeah well magic

829
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:47,190
not so much I I am you know in the

830
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,720
process of writing like a post about how

831
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,399
that works and stuff like that I don't

832
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,389
know if you want to know that because

833
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:54,240
yes so just quickly a few resources I

834
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,070
can share the slides online later but

835
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,679
here's a few tools and useful links and

836
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,080
I'm Way over time that I said and well
