1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:21,510

you

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,500


3
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,610
so in case you miss it the miss the big

4
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,920
yellow break sign this is the

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,260
hitchhiker's guide to yu xing with aux

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,090
ER and in case any of you don't know

7
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,350
this is me and me so my name is christy

8
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,480
welsh and i'm the lead ux for a company

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,460
called back base and we handle like

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,600
basically the front end for like a

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,550
financial institutions like ABN amro and

12
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,650
stuff but precursor to that i'm also

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,900
pointed their cloud nine idea luminoso

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,149
was there Liam you x over there as well

15
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:04,160
before I started there and my background

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,229
is in working with development teams to

17
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:09,729
really try and build great stuff and

18
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,660
this is what I wanted to talk about

19
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,600
which is sort of like the big elephant

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,720
in the room as i like to think about it

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,619
I'm gonna check more anymore yeah I am

22
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:25,280
in control okay so this is a big

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,340
elephant in the room and this is a here

24
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,830
right this is what I hear over and over

25
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,140
and over again I want to build great

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,000
things I start with really great

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,220
intentions but it always turns out

28
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,880
rubbish what happened and this is a

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,720
story I here and it's so so prevalent

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,759
and it all the different teams i work in

31
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,659
and this is how it happens is that you

32
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,880
start at Point a and you want to build

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,619
the best app you want to build the best

34
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:56,780
product and your little startup team and

35
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,810
you need to get to point B and you think

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,960
this is the way to do it as quickly and

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,869
as fast as possible that's not

38
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:08,600
necessarily the best thing because

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,459
you're great experiences and you're

40
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:12,530
happy users and you're easy interfaces

41
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,019
kind of live outside of that fast

42
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:17,030
approach if you want to build great

43
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,950
things you kind of have to live a little

44
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,680
bit outside of the fast approach to

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,930
getting things done and getting things

46
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,370
done kind of looks like a big wavy line

47
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,590
like this if you want to do it really

48
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,720
really well

49
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,190
by the way you to panic about it and I

50
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,049
want you to worry that you can still get

51
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,280
things done you can still do it in the

52
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,519
right way without having to take the

53
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,610
faster with all the time and this is

54
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,900
really what I want to talk to you just

55
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,640
now so I have about 20 minutes so you

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,129
gotta kind of keep your hat on because

57
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:49,480
we're going to be going really fast is

58
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,879
that I want to take you through how

59
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,160
important it is to have a vision and you

60
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,390
just need the one you don't need many

61
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,049
just have a one vision I want to see how

62
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:04,000
you help you think like a user help you

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,569
help your users why you should wireframe

64
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,109
at all and how to do it how to make

65
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,239
something throw away like a prototype

66
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,030
that allows you to test some of your

67
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,200
hypotheses laser to test whether your

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,569
ideas even good at all how to evaluate

69
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:23,109
that and lastly when you should scrap it

70
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:30,430
if you need to scrap it because ooh slow

71
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,190
sync because the journey of a thousand

72
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,959
miles always starts with one set and for

73
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,340
those of you who like journey and have a

74
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,810
ps2 is the slice for you know one

75
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,639
awesome one person of the back I like

76
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:55,180
you okay okay that's not good

77
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,440
yay ok so the vision do you have one for

78
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,510
your product if you don't have one I

79
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,990
would ask why not so whenever you start

80
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,850
today with them an idea of what you want

81
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,400
to make you tended to think a lot about

82
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,230
what it should do and what it should be

83
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,709
and it's very important to keep that in

84
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,770
mind because if you tick I set aside and

85
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,989
you take a step away from it you what

86
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:23,880
you get is feature creep and you get

87
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,800
lots of things being added in they don't

88
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,840
necessarily adhere to what was going to

89
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,180
be the great thing in the first place

90
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,850
Queen had the vision one with a very

91
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,770
nice record for those Queen fans and I'm

92
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:44,910
going to Queen the fun excellent so this

93
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,320
is what I want you to do and this will

94
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,730
keep you honest when it comes to your

95
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,830
vision I want you to print this out and

96
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,960
I want you to put on your wall whenever

97
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,100
you're going into your development

98
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,830
environment what one thing do you want

99
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,590
your product your service you're

100
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,980
offering to do well just one you can

101
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,380
have ok i'll let you have one or two but

102
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,060
it should really do one thing really

103
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,520
really well it should do one thing

104
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,470
awesome and you should know what that is

105
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,270
and it should be visible to everyone i

106
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,850
have made for my entire team to see in

107
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,530
the wall every single day and it's 80

108
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,110
does not like a for like second off it's

109
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,570
really massive and make sure that

110
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,480
whenever we do something it always we

111
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,050
reference us back all the same because

112
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,550
it should be simple until you make it

113
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,140
complicated the thing that you're

114
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,060
building the startup you have it should

115
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,160
start simple because it's very easy to

116
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,230
add complications in it's very difficult

117
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,540
to keep things simple so starting with

118
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,750
the user do you know who your users are

119
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,850
when you start with your products when

120
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,169
you start with your service do you know

121
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:50,550
who they are do you know what they're

122
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,600
doing do you know what they're trying to

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,260
do you know why they're doing it and if

124
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,120
you want to be good at us and you want

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,190
to do this with aux are this is one of

126
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,260
the top tips I can give you and that is

127
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,890
really think about who your users are

128
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,570
writer who will be using application or

129
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:06,960
your web

130
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,350
right their age their education and then

131
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,539
finally I want you to name that person

132
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,060
in this case we've got Arthur dance here

133
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,900
for those like Douglas Adams yay booboo

134
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,970
bunny slippers coats funny t-shirt

135
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,389
anyway this is who the user is and when

136
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,150
you do this they become real so whenever

137
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,759
you think what would Arthur do in this

138
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,919
situation would he want this we do you

139
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,180
want this feature if you're adding

140
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,440
something new in so why crazy lady are

141
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,220
you making me named imaginary people

142
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,020
that's the second thing I get a lot from

143
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,690
developers why am i creating imaginary

144
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,520
people right of nowhere and why are you

145
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,570
making me do this because I want you to

146
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,949
do this I want you to fight for your

147
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:59,699
users and I'm mixing metaphors but your

148
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,820
users are what's going to make you

149
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,340
popular they're going to make you

150
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,539
successful they're going to use your

151
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:07,860
application they're going to use your

152
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,659
products they're the ones who are going

153
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,729
to make it awesome for you and your job

154
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:12,870
and they're going to they're the ones

155
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,919
that keep you in your job they're

156
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,820
probably the ones with the paid

157
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,979
subscriptions you've got to fight for

158
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,070
them and less or the businesses more for

159
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,830
the user so this is how simple your user

160
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,719
persona and we call them personas in the

161
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:29,130
UX industry but it won't bog you down

162
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,680
too much with this can a technical

163
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,199
details but this is an hour third less

164
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,789
attractive older brother called James

165
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:40,650
this is james then 32 I've written down

166
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,659
some kegels for what he is he knows what

167
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:45,270
he wants to buy and his behaviors he

168
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,460
gets bored very quickly so don't serve

169
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,860
them fluffy product descriptions and

170
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,780
doing overwhelming too much of a choice

171
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,979
because you're going to lose them so

172
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,599
this is basically if you have a website

173
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,479
or service and this is just a very

174
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,580
simple example of how a personal in our

175
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,110
hair a user that you can reference can

176
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,979
be it can be this simple ok I'm going to

177
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,150
stand next to my computer because my

178
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,229
remote just lost connection so what does

179
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,050
it look like in real life

180
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,110
well it can look like this this is a bit

181
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,400
more complicated but there's no point

182
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm trying to illustrate is a really no

183
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,080
right or wrong way to do persona work it

184
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,560
can be a couple of different ways or is

185
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,080
this right whatever makes sense to you

186
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
wherever you understand the best a

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,099
couple of these have some benefits over

188
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:36,380
others but it really depends on how you

189
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,029
understand your users and how you want

190
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,829
to you how you want to do it next thing

191
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,540
I want you to do is start to worry Finn

192
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,670
so before you touch a single piece of

193
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,320
code with your awesome idea and your one

194
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,820
vision and you know who's going to use

195
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,760
it I want you to get hit the pen and

196
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,089
paper if you can do this you can really

197
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,040
get to grips with what you should be

198
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,200
building and wireframes are not about

199
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,700
pretty pictures they're a bit getting

200
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,910
the functionality right about what

201
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,380
should be in there and why on earth

202
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,050
would you do that well there's a couple

203
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,880
of key benefits to wire framing I can

204
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,459
tell you really really fast early things

205
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,220
out super fast imagine a wall of just a

206
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,600
four sheets you can pull that together

207
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,810
in 30 minutes 40 minutes you can s rate

208
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,220
on that and even faster our mount of

209
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,950
time it's super super easy to see

210
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,130
everything that you have and you can

211
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,570
iterate on it you can pull stain

212
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,850
redraw it put it back up again you can

213
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,320
have this whole process doesn't have to

214
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,490
be long and it doesn't have to be

215
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,860
involved but it will help you get things

216
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,600
right and it'll help you get them right

217
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,459
before you waste time and money on code

218
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,410
because it's cheaper than changing code

219
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,390
changing pieces of paper so much cheaper

220
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,560
than changing code paying for a

221
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,079
developer to have to redo things if you

222
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,700
can hit it on the paper then it'll save

223
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,380
you a lot of time and effort so again

224
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,870
this is about ideas and this is about

225
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,579
iteration and I was kind of trying to

226
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,520
illustrate a point which is having one

227
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,160
idea super great I'm glad you have one

228
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,199
unlike right behind you in your corner

229
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:13,339
clapping iteration and one idea even

230
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:15,110
better you've taken that one idea and

231
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,730
you've taken a couple of steps further

232
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,740
and you've made it you've made it you

233
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,120
takin it to the pinnacle of what it can

234
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,050
be but you get a couple of ideas going

235
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,760
you're a tree on them

236
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,980
and you can get something that is just

237
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,950
super cool ready for the vision that you

238
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,140
had in mind in the first place you str8

239
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,090
on something and you go over a few times

240
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,160
and you build it you can have something

241
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,670
which is exponentially better than the

242
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,830
very first idea you had never ever hit

243
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,270
code if I can give you a 10 piece of

244
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,300
advice with the first idea you get

245
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,520
percolate and they go over a few things

246
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,500
first so what the wireframes look like

247
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,900
well i thought i would share one of mine

248
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,870
and the point i'm trying to make is

249
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,090
they're not pretty and they're not there

250
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,100
to be pretty they're there to be

251
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,030
functional and friendly you have used

252
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,980
Clayton an ID in the past this was one

253
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,010
of the dialog boxes I had done for cloud

254
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,370
nine and it's a complicated piece of

255
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,220
dialogue box with lots of bits that you

256
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,400
can't read in my scribbling handwriting

257
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,090
but trust me it's all golden and what

258
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,760
does it turn into well with a visual

259
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,170
designer can turn into something like

260
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,480
this before a programmer works on it but

261
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,370
it just means that whenever you start

262
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,870
work you've got it right the first time

263
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,300
imagine having to iterate on this three

264
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,980
four or five times before you get it

265
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,800
right the developer would be me

266
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,690
in the back if I turned my back on them

267
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,280
for too long but what if you really hate

268
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,260
paper you're allergic to it you

269
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,680
absolutely can't stand it or you had the

270
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,270
really bad experience in art class and

271
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,500
you never want to touch a piece of paper

272
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,140
again well don't panic you can use

273
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,250
software to their software like balsamic

274
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,250
FNA who knows balsamic oh you're just

275
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,780
damn awesome I love you who likes it

276
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:18,890
less people okay right so this is

277
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,460
balsamic and later to do some very fast

278
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,370
iterations on layouts and designs you

279
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,780
can throw things into there and you can

280
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,570
export it as PDF or PNG and that allows

281
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,100
you to do multiple things print them out

282
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,980
put them on the wall use them as a

283
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,360
prototyping like screens together do the

284
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,769
whole heap of things you can do with it

285
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,230
this one again so Clayton an example and

286
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,360
it was doing a flow diagram for how you

287
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,639
can actually get through from one screen

288
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,019
to the next and what you actually have

289
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,999
to show each stage and there's lots of

290
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,970
little virtual sticky notes because I

291
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,350
like sticky notes so some wireframing

292
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,569
tools that you can use so you're not

293
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,309
limited to pen and paper or balsamic

294
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:00,839
there's actually a whole heap of things

295
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,189
it depends what you're comfortable and I

296
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:04,170
guess and there's no hard and fast rules

297
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,480
as long as you do it at some point and

298
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,879
that is pen and paper would be my number

299
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,339
one because it's super fast and super

300
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,850
cheap and if you're allergic to pen and

301
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,429
paper you can use balsamic and if you

302
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,869
really hate balsamic you can go back to

303
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:21,119
Phantom favors most of the room seems to

304
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:23,730
do and there's that clear as well but

305
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,319
that's super expensive it's like six

306
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:27,179
thousand euros or something like that

307
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,259
for its year so unless you're a

308
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:29,910
corporate company I would avoid that one

309
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,980
and then there's your usual photoshop

310
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,610
illustrator so I'll tell you if you're

311
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,920
going to show wires to a client or wire

312
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,079
frame to a client never ever ever show

313
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,790
them paper never ever they will not

314
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,559
understand that I have two stories for

315
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,540
that i showed the clients and paper i

316
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,399
spent a whole week doing these really

317
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,920
great markups and I was thinking they'll

318
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,439
get it they'll understand this the idea

319
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,629
is golden and solids they looked at

320
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:57,209
paper and why are you writing on paper I

321
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:59,240
don't understand what we paying you for

322
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,809
conceptually they don't really

323
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:02,459
understand that so if you're going to

324
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,350
shoe a client something try to go as

325
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,139
high fidelity as possible and by high

326
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,970
fidelity I mean like as visual as you

327
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,029
can with it but i also have a story

328
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,480
about that i showed a client once a

329
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,009
really high fidelity wireframes because

330
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:19,319
of that first experience and I went I'm

331
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,119
not going through that again so I went

332
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,179
into its really awesome photoshop like

333
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,410
wireframes and these things were cool

334
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,990
and you know what happened they like the

335
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,059
wireframe so much i ended up being here

336
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:32,549
it would look so the wireframes in

337
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:34,499
greenway i kid you not was what they

338
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,119
wanted to produce at the end because it

339
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:39,209
was so high fidelity so i would take the

340
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,129
middle road not one or the other or

341
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,839
you're in dangerous territory at the

342
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,619
other end and envision app who knows

343
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,309
envision of couple of people start to

344
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,329
bring the back if you

345
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,100
no way it's really great you can link

346
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,879
flat screens like PNG's or and JPEGs or

347
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,589
whatever you want is really super cool

348
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:00,869
and you can create like little

349
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:02,730
prototypes for yourself and you can

350
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,160
share those with people so you can link

351
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,379
those bad boys up and that's going to be

352
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,139
good so what does a prototype look like

353
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,119
well you know how i made you do all

354
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,619
those wireframes earlier and you've got

355
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:15,509
all these bits of paper well guess what

356
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:17,579
you can do with them you can make puts

357
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,410
of types with them and you can actually

358
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,420
shuffle those bits of people around ask

359
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,309
people to click on them ask for feedback

360
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:25,649
so do you know where you're going give

361
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,360
them a task to do give them the paper

362
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,009
and you move the paper arraigned and see

363
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,449
if they do a task now if you're

364
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:32,899
wondering how that what that looks like

365
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,809
it looks like this so you have little

366
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,910
pieces of paper they can be drawing so

367
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,019
you don't have to be Prince I it's just

368
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,329
in case you're wondering and you just

369
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:43,920
shuffle them around and you ask people

370
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,379
to use your finger as a mess and you can

371
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,970
click on things and this is a really

372
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,730
nice easy fast cheap way especially if

373
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,439
you're a bit strapped company very cheap

374
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:55,439
to do this and this is kind of people

375
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:57,299
working their way through their wire

376
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,619
frames and you can see some confused

377
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:01,199
faces you will see that a lot if you do

378
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,850
this but you will also catch a lot of

379
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,160
your problems in your functionality by

380
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,079
doing this very small step and actually

381
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,149
showing something earlier there's a

382
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,119
great and cool I said I heard and that

383
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,669
was if you're uncomfortable showing your

384
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,499
work you're at the right stage to show

385
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,569
it so if you're uncomfortable showing it

386
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,369
that's the point where you should be

387
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:21,689
doing it because you'll catch all the

388
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,759
the bugs and things earlier in your own

389
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,269
designs and this is envisioned app so

390
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:28,709
this is what I was telling you about so

391
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,239
if you want to link those screens and

392
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,939
you have flat screens already great till

393
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:34,799
to do it creates little hot spots you

394
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,480
can click on things link them together

395
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,579
works really well what's really cool and

396
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,410
if anyone wants to see these things I

397
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,509
have live example so i can take you over

398
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:45,959
to the hallway right there and then i

399
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,429
can show you stuff as well if you really

400
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:52,529
is you really curious about it so so far

401
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,299
I've made you print a vision on a wall

402
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,459
what you're all very happy you've got

403
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,889
your one fashion just like Queen you've

404
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:02,639
got you know who your users are and you

405
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,799
can reference them you've got some wire

406
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,169
frame

407
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:06,159
that you've turned into a clickable

408
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,289
prototype know what you're going to do

409
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:11,350
well I want you to evaluate your own

410
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,419
work I want you to put the shoes on of

411
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:16,299
that James Dan Arthur is less attractive

412
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:17,919
older brother and I want you to think

413
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,289
like him whenever you look at your work

414
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,149
it doesn't have to be about just trying

415
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:25,629
to point and and when you think about

416
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,429
them I want you to really see if you can

417
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,499
be that person be that user and evaluate

418
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:31,389
your work it's great to get other ppl n

419
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:33,759
or segment groups but that's costly and

420
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,009
this total talk is about bootstrap

421
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:37,679
startups and how to get started quickly

422
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,049
so put on the shoes of the user evaluate

423
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,830
your work other ways you can do to

424
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,840
gather data there's a great tool it's

425
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,480
called usability hub it's a camera based

426
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,419
system so you evaluate other people's

427
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:54,279
work they evaluate yours and you get

428
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,799
really really awesome feedback and it

429
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,039
helps em and this is not a very involved

430
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,109
process but it is testing and it's good

431
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:05,350
testing and again you can use these kind

432
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,269
of fluids and diagrams and EP splits to

433
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:08,259
actually get some really cool stuff

434
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:15,609
going so this is why we're doing all

435
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,830
this right it's because greatness and

436
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,289
real true greatness does not take

437
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:22,929
shortcuts and it's true it doesn't

438
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:26,049
there's no quick way to e to be but I

439
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,450
can get the process down a lot shorter

440
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,730
and smaller so that you can get to

441
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,919
greatness a lot faster but it does

442
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:34,149
require a bit of work in a bit of

443
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:38,440
thinking so what if you can't evaluate

444
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,859
that work fairly yourself what if you

445
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,019
can't you don't can't conceptualize and

446
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,820
you just can't evaluate what you're

447
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,769
trying to do you look at it and it looks

448
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:49,690
okay to you but you get the feeling it's

449
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,460
maybe not so what happens if you can't

450
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,629
do it by yourself you need to find a

451
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:59,200
friend maybe not these friends I don't

452
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,700
think Courteney Cox is going to value

453
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,070
your application for you but if you have

454
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,649
a friends bring them in try not to tell

455
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:07,299
them anything about what you're doing

456
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,090
and get them to sit down and use what

457
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,259
you're building if you're uncomfortable

458
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,299
showing what you've got you're probably

459
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:15,309
doing it ray because you're getting that

460
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:17,770
feedback early

461
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,400
and this is somewhat what it looks like

462
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,830
so you've got to set the back and send

463
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,080
nothing and they're going to set the

464
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,180
front and they're going to do a couple

465
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,100
of tacit you set them or they're going

466
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,230
to talk to you about what they think

467
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,810
about what they're seeing and then you

468
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,760
get to write down or you get to say

469
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,620
nothing but just take notes and the best

470
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,630
advice I can give you is to sit and do

471
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,950
nothing and try to give nothing away

472
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,010
because a user will try to please you so

473
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,420
someone that you get n even your friends

474
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,210
will try to do it right and that some

475
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,840
that can be dangerous because if you're

476
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,040
they'll want to make sure that your

477
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,690
product is good but what you really want

478
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,730
is fear feedback so the list the less

479
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,440
you say at this point the best the

480
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,550
better so what really happens when it

481
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,470
doesn't go as expected so you've done

482
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,750
all this hard work right and you've got

483
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,880
the evaluation back and actually the

484
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,060
evaluation gave you something like this

485
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,160
probably because you didn't stay true to

486
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,860
your one vision you've had one two three

487
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,600
four visions in there or something and

488
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,580
you've got a bit of a Frankenstein's

489
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,470
monster of a product or service that

490
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,680
does nothing really very well well at

491
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,450
this point you really need to think

492
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,990
about your own work right so you need to

493
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,160
think about this so you're going to keep

494
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,950
it or are you going to bin it and this

495
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,240
is when I was trying to tell you about

496
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,910
earlier is that it's a process and if

497
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,880
it's a fast process and you can get to

498
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,070
this point a lot faster is that there's

499
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,660
no point in spending six months your

500
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,250
life developing something that isn't

501
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,320
great or isn't going to be great and

502
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,150
it's much better for you if you've been

503
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,500
at earlier than it as if you keep going

504
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,060
so please don't get too attached to your

505
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,770
projects they can some things feel like

506
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,140
your little baby that you have your a

507
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,910
golden channel that's going to become in

508
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,220
the next Jesus but it's probably better

509
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,320
that you are able to evaluate your work

510
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,030
and see if it is good because the next

511
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,560
great idea could be just raining the

512
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,759
corner for you as well so

513
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,129
is this everything I have to tell you

514
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:24,549
about user experience oh no need a whole

515
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,669
lot more to it than this but if we're

516
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:28,989
talking about getting the basics right

517
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:30,369
and we're talking about building

518
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:31,899
something really really super awesome

519
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,570
then this is going to help you get

520
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,609
started really quickly really well it's

521
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:38,559
going to get you to the point where you

522
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,239
could probably hire a professional and

523
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:42,459
to do this for you and that if I can

524
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:44,199
make any recommendation to someone is

525
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:46,149
that they don't do it themselves you

526
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:48,309
actually get professional in but if you

527
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:51,279
do if you have to then please do these

528
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,459
steps so here's what we just covered in

529
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:56,519
a very fast lightning style fashion

530
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,739
which is how important it is to have one

531
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:01,269
of your visions and pin it on your wall

532
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:02,979
and make it visible so that everything

533
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:06,159
you do you reference back to that how

534
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,849
you can think like a user which is take

535
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:11,469
those steps to write down who they are

536
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:14,229
name them please reference them whenever

537
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:17,169
you think about your features I want you

538
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,989
to think about wireframing I want you to

539
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:21,609
think about getting the functionality of

540
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:22,809
what you're trying to do right make sure

541
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,759
all the steps in place if you need to

542
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,649
think about the edge cases please do but

543
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,179
make it work for the eighty percent of

544
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:30,399
your users first and then the last

545
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:31,989
twenty percent you can make work with

546
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:35,049
the edge cases how to make a throwaway

547
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:38,469
prototype which is use those wireframes

548
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:41,199
uses paper reuse them and actually make

549
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:44,819
a finger clickable for a tightly can use

550
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:47,079
how to evaluate your own work which is

551
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,239
take a step back and really think about

552
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:51,839
your user and f it fits their needs and

553
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,309
finally when you need to scrap it which

554
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,259
is after the evaluation process if it

555
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:58,239
didn't go well you need to really think

556
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:02,619
about whether you should carry on so so

557
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:04,449
long and thanks for all the fish I will

558
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,789
be taking questions so I think I did

559
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,889
that in super fast time so I'm free for

560
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,999
some questions or not yes okay couple of

561
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:15,219
minutes anyone have any questions with

562
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:16,809
all that lightening fast speeds there's

563
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:20,019
a hand behind the camera man hand you

564
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:24,789
can go

565
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:51,820
yes okay

566
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,330
okay so what you're saying to me is that

567
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,880
whenever someone you're saying that

568
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,700
clients need to see something of a high

569
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,910
fidelity or kindly to see low fidelity

570
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,860
because then they understand it's going

571
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:15,510
to take longer to build see that that

572
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,700
sent like a workaround for a different

573
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,350
problem that's someone showing low

574
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,030
fidelity because it can't explain to the

575
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,380
client how long it's going to take to

576
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,580
actually build so that sounds more like

577
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,440
a communication problem than what you

578
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,700
should actually do with your user

579
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,070
experience but when it comes to little

580
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,230
fidelity the benefits of our that it's

581
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,060
throw away and it's fast high fidelity

582
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,550
takes longer to do so whenever you do

583
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,590
things a higher level of design is ready

584
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,480
to be built is ready to pastor developer

585
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,160
but you should be getting that feedback

586
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,930
much hair lair on if you're talking

587
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,300
about clients then you should be getting

588
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,680
the feedback for what you're building

589
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,080
and a medium to high fidelity stage if

590
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,910
you sure something to finish like I was

591
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,410
saying in my earlier example they

592
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,580
actually think that's what they're going

593
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,230
to get because the design hasn't touched

594
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,060
it yet that something is what you end up

595
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,400
building but my advice would always be

596
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,580
and what I just stated which is used a

597
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,890
little fidelity internally use it for

598
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,780
yourself it's not for shoes to other

599
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,120
people when you get to a medium or

600
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,890
you're iterating on that to look a

601
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,960
little better and it can look a little

602
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,880
better in like balsamic or any kind of

603
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,650
digital tools little fidelity I consider

604
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,690
to be paper medium I consider to be

605
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,650
balsamic or like lanes and boxes and

606
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,420
illustrator and when it comes to high

607
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,400
fidelity I consider that to be almost

608
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,470
finished designs in photoshop so i would

609
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,630
take the middle part and i will show

610
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,830
that clients that would be my advice hi

611
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,200
chris how does it have a question

612
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,090
what are you in your experience the

613
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,490
signals that tell you whether UX design

614
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,020
from a development perspective there are

615
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,150
other signals but from a UX designer

616
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,580
design is a throwaway or it can be

617
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,740
improved like what what's what are the

618
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,740
markers you

619
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,380
if every single user has turned brain to

620
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,030
you and said I don't understand what I'm

621
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,040
doing I don't understand what this

622
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,840
serves or what purposes is then that

623
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
would be a surefire saying that you need

624
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,380
to stop what you're doing because no one

625
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,000
is getting it the ones getting the idea

626
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,920
of the vision but if people are saying

627
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,590
oh I see it now i can get it comes down

628
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,179
to the feedback it comes in to

629
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:14,650
interpretation of the feedback that you

630
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,830
get so if you get some positive parts

631
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,960
inside the feedback then you can carry

632
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,730
on but if everything you're getting

633
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,500
comes back negative that would be the

634
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,660
point where i would say this is not

635
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,280
really going to work or they don't get

636
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,870
what i'm trying to do so maybe what

637
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,840
you've done doesn't quote doesn't go to

638
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,340
the vision of what you were trying to

639
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:38,050
create thank you you're welcome more

640
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:45,640
questions yeah so we philly at the end

641
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,020
when you finally get around to making

642
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,330
like an actual prototype because I i

643
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,950
follow this model before and I find it

644
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,530
quite waterfall like it gets to stage of

645
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,150
the bells and by the time you get to end

646
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,590
of the build everything's had to change

647
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,750
because of various things of this and I

648
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,090
tend to find when you get to stage where

649
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,590
you're making like a clickable prototype

650
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,690
these days most people can make it just

651
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,280
as fast in something like bit strut and

652
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,250
make something that's actually real I

653
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,600
most people have worked with in UX or

654
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,160
find that a lot better to do it that way

655
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,200
yeah actually make something real so

656
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,510
people can use a computer click around

657
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,000
as opposed to just a mud and what it

658
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,860
might be like yeah I'm with you there if

659
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,750
you're actually much more versatile you

660
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,490
have a dedicated UX professional that is

661
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,559
the way to go if you don't have that

662
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,510
then I would much recommend you don't

663
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,190
have to do a clickable prototypes you

664
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,050
can do them on paper before you start

665
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,550
the development cycle if you don't have

666
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,130
someone like me in your team but I work

667
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,380
in agile team so it's not this waterfall

668
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,510
we is an iterative process you do go

669
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,280
through in fact I've worked in link

670
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,470
teams before we are on your own even but

671
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,540
and the answer to your question is if

672
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,210
you have a dedicated UX person then what

673
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,740
you're describing is absolutely one

674
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,270
hundred percent too if you don't have a

675
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,070
dedicated person which is what this talk

676
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,080
is for then these steps will help you

677
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,500
keep things honest keep things good also

678
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,830
you can use topcoat staff bootstrap you

679
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,600
can use lots of things you can love you

680
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,010
lots of frameworks

681
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,110
we're not exclusive I I've got a

682
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,530
question shapes miss selfishly jump in

683
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,050
how do you feel mobile impacts this do

684
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,210
you guys do like mock up some wire

685
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,130
frames for like all the possible screen

686
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,230
sizes when you're in your building stuff

687
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,370
out and the answer is I generally do

688
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,750
depends on what you're building f it is

689
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,030
cross device if its mobile tablet

690
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,980
desktop then yes of course you have to

691
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,420
factor that in and there's actually

692
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,920
really cool things if you're working in

693
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,110
paper there's post-its I've now got the

694
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,570
mobile size because they understand that

695
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,340
people use them though whenever they're

696
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,320
wireframing so you can even get posted

697
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,300
some tablet and mobile now and you can

698
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,590
just draw them on and they're the right

699
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,390
size for you to work on so you don't

700
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,890
even need to like work out what the

701
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,230
sizes are anymore so the answer is yes

702
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,810
and there is lots of strategies and for

703
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,550
UX to work on which is mobile first

704
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,070
which is a popular one but I would

705
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,810
generally work if it's cross-device yes

706
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,940
of course I was working with the core

707
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,530
functionality would be in put that in

708
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,630
the smaller devices first but you've got

709
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,610
device appropriateness as well which is

710
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,110
some things are not appropriate per

711
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,330
device so for example if you're doing

712
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,100
I'll just give you a recent one loan

713
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,470
application forms not appropriate for

714
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,270
mobile however information on loan

715
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,890
application forms are more appropriate

716
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,920
tablet desktop so it's sometimes you

717
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,990
have to not always go well this is

718
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,100
essential for mobile but what's

719
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,440
appropriate per device as well and that

720
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,020
factors into the UX process too so I

721
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,980
don't know if that answers your question

722
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,690
or not totally ok cool more questions oh

723
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,560
yeah last last question I think last

724
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,050
question and I'll be out in the hallway

725
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,910
for any more questions if you want me to

726
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,370
look at anything I'm here to help you so

727
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,120
if you need any advice so you're talking

728
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,120
about the user personas and breaking

729
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,010
that down really on digging into who

730
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,230
your user basis do you have anything to

731
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,150
say about when you're seeking feedback

732
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:02,200
how best to or if it makes sense to go

733
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,120
after specific representatives from the

734
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,700
that user base yeah there is a more

735
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,860
involved process where you can go after

736
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,810
the segments that you've described you

737
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,450
can go after that 30 year old value

738
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,370
hunter for example or something that you

739
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,110
really want to go for and you have to

740
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,390
make your own judgment as to

741
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,400
you you categorize those people so yes

742
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,020
of course you will get better results if

743
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,210
you do that but it's better to get any

744
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,120
feedback than none so it's better to

745
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,920
just get some feedback than no feedback

746
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,290
no feedback is the death of whatever

747
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,610
you're doing but some feedback will help

748
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,710
you and even better than that is exactly

749
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,090
what you described which is targeted

750
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,520
feedback but that takes a long more

751
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,080
involved process and again if you don't

752
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,600
have a dedicated professional than any

753
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,470
feedbacks better than none awesome Thank

754
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:56,669
