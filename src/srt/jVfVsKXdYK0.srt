1
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:15,750
Hope you're enjoying the conference so far.

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,640
I wish I could be there in person, but this
is the next best thing.

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,260
And I'm excited to talk about accessibility
and coats of arms.

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,150
So, if you're someone who likes to follow
along with slides while the talk is going,

5
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,180
I did Tweet them out so you can go and look
me up on Twitter if you want to access those.

6
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,691
The inspiration for this talk is basically
in software design and development, often

7
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:46,829
we deal with complex problems and lessons
that can feel kind of novel and new at first.

8
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,120
But a lot of times these are problems that
people have wrestled with in some capacity

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,860
for years or even centuries.

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,700
So, I thought it would be interesting to take
a look at design, specifically accessibility,

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,430
within the historical lens of coats of arms.

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:09,770
So, it give you an idea of where we're headed,
I'll hope by giving you some historical context

13
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,460
about coats of arms and what they're for and
where they come from.

14
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,100
For the meat of this talk, we'll look at the
lessons we can learn from the designs of coats

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:25,470
of arms and how to apply those in our work
in software.

16
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,659
A popular place you might have seen coats
of arms recently is in Game of Thrones.

17
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:37,430
If you're a fan, you might recognize some
of the symbols like the Stark's direwolf or

18
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,259
the Lannister lion.

19
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:45,810
These had special meanings to the houses and
were used to identify people who belonged

20
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,350
to one of those houses.

21
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,659
Accessibility is kind of a big word.

22
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,920
And especially in the last two to five years,
it's been kind of a buzzword.

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,950
This talk is not meant to be an introduction
to accessibility.

24
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,729
There are college courses and degrees and
certificates on that subject.

25
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:10,289
But just to kind of look at best practices
of accessibility within a different historical

26
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,400
lens.

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,829
And hopefully you'll learn some interesting
things and kind of gain a new perspective.

28
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:22,799
So, as you probably know, accessibility's
about more than just what something looks

29
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:23,799
like.

30
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:28,019
So, more than just kind of using good contrast
and having a readable font.

31
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:33,180
It means designing for people with motor impairments,
by providing keyboard accessible functions

32
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,449
for everything that you expect a use to do.

33
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:39,439
Means accommodating screenreaders for your
website.

34
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,439
Things like that.

35
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,870
So, again, this is not intended to be a comprehensive
introduction to accessibility.

36
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,830
But I did pull the top ten rules on accessibility
practices from the guide to the Internet for

37
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,549
the EU.

38
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,180
And those are you don't worry about memorizing
these or anything.

39
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,269
I just to want review them quickly.

40
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:01,540
Number one, structured contents.

41
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,480
Avoid dependence on any one single sense,
eyesight in particular.

42
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,799
Help your users avoid mistakes.

43
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,140
If they make a mistake, show them how to correct
it.

44
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,879
Avoid flashing.

45
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,040
Try to provide text descriptions where possible.

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,370
Make the functions on your site or app keyboard
accessible.

47
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,430
Avoid rushing your users.

48
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,749
Identify links and where they will take you.

49
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:30,930
Keep navigation UI consistent and try and
keep your experience compatible across devices

50
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,930
and browsers.

51
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:38,001
So, I boiled those down more into three big
rules which are: Structure contents, avoid

52
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:43,920
dependence on any single sense and avoid rushing
your users or pigeonholing them into any one

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
action.

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,359
So, if you hear the term "Coats of arms,"
you might picture something like this.

55
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:52,459
That's not what it is.

56
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:58,400
The term is if I were getting ready for battle
and putting on a suit of armor, I would put

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,209
on a coat over that that would have a coat
of arms or essentially a crest printed on

58
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,819
it.

59
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:11,150
The purpose of a coat of arms is to be easily
identifiable for the house or country it represents.

60
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,700
And there are several reasons why that's good.

61
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,680
It enables you to record and embellish the
history of your nation in kind of a visual

62
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
format.

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,090
It was a way to identify the dead.

64
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,560
So that you could look at their coat and see
what house they belonged to.

65
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,190
A way to declare military units.

66
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:33,289
If I was traveling and saw a group of people,
I could see if they were friendly based on

67
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,500
what they were wearing.

68
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,340
A means to establish pedigree if you could
trace back your coat several generations and

69
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,760
a way to pass down family honors or symbols.

70
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,260
So, I'm gonna use the term "Heraldry."

71
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,889
Heraldry is the system by which coats of arms
and other bearings are devised, described

72
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:53,889
and regulated.

73
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,449
It's kind of the overarching context.

74
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:02,070
I'm going to use the terms emblem and seal
interchangeably with coats of arms.

75
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,219
They're considered subsets of coats of arms
if I show you something that's more like a

76
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:11,770
seal for a later, it's also a coat of arms.

77
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,389
I wanted to touch on rights of use for coats
of arms because I think it's kind of interesting.

78
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,849
I pulled facts from the countries I researched
while preparing for this talk.

79
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:26,900
In Denmark, any unlawful use of heraldic arms
is a criminal offense.

80
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,849
If I'm using a coat of arms that I don't have
the rights to, I could be charged criminally.

81
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:39,150
In Italy, heraldic matters were ruled outside
of the scope of official law.

82
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,169
Can in South Africa, they said all citizens
can wear arm it is they please.

83
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:48,520
So, kind of a more flexible approach there.

84
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,050
In Scotland, coats of arms are considered
inheritable property.

85
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,129
I inherit the family farm and then also the
family coat of arms.

86
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:01,570
And in Ireland, if you can trace back your
ancestry, you can be granted the rights to

87
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,310
a coat of arms.

88
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,680
So, I came up with a basic timeline for key
events in different regions surrounding this

89
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
concept.

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,229
So, the earliest reference that we have to
coats of arms in general is in 2000B.C., Egyptian

91
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,330
hieroglyphics and artwork, they had rulers
who wore emblems to signify why where they

92
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,350
came from.

93
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:31,879
And in the book of numbers in the Bible, it's
the insignia of the children of Italy, a precursor.

94
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,990
Then they were in use by western nobilities.

95
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,680
By the 16th century, strictly regulated in
Ireland.

96
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,840
And the 17th through 19th centuries, they
were widely used to record family history.

97
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,620
So, some interesting event there is.

98
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
Great.

99
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,889
Now let's see what we looked like.

100
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,190
I tried to pull a decedent sample size of
different kinds of designs.

101
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,500
It's not totally comprehensive.

102
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,840
And I'm going to start with what you are familiar
with you have seen crests in a tourist shop

103
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,260
or something like that.

104
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,779
They were probably from Scotland or Ireland.

105
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:14,040
So, often the ones that people are familiar
with are from Europe.

106
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,900
And particularly in this top row you can see
some design commonalities with the two figures

107
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,460
on either side and the shield in the forefront
and then some type of crown symbol and maybe

108
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,819
a motto as well.

109
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:29,720
You can see certain similarities in a lot
of those.

110
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,960
Asian heraldry, the ones for China and south
Korea look more like seals in this case.

111
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,699
They're kind of more round and bold.

112
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,370
The one representing the Russian empire, you
can see the western influence.

113
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,070
It's got kind of some similarities to the
ones on the previous slide.

114
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:53,770
And point out Japan in the bottom row, those
are pictures of Mon, emblems used to present

115
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,240
houses and we will talk about them.

116
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:04,960
And you can see western influence, particularly
with colonialism, with Nigeria, Malawi and

117
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,210
Somalia and Kenya, and you can see the supporters
on the central shield.

118
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:18,659
And then in the bottom right, the complete
of arms for Sudan has an eagle which is a

119
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:23,160
common trend for coats of arms from the Middle
East.

120
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,860
These are what some of the different heraldic
signs look like in the Middle East.

121
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:33,479
And you can see many feature this eagle which
is the eagle of Saladin and a motto on the

122
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,479
bottom.

123
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,029
It's interesting to see certain patterns in
various regions when it comes to their coats

124
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:43,099
of arms.

125
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,820
These are some of the symbols from the Americas.

126
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,670
These ones tend I think they all have some
kind of greenery which is kind of interesting.

127
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,440
They also tend to be a little bit taller than
the others which I also found to be interesting.

128
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,150
And maybe a little bit more color as well.

129
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,150
Great.

130
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,170
So, again, that's not obviously all of the
coats of arms there are, but it's a sampling.

131
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,649
So, we were to think about what makes a good
coat of arms, if we were to create our own,

132
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,639
we would want it to be easily identifiable.

133
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,740
Potentially across a battlefield to our enemies.

134
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,029
We might want to incorporate symbols that
have special meaning to us or look impressive

135
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,550
to someone else.

136
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,440
Those are things to keep in mind as we keep
going.

137
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,810
This is, again, some of the samples that I
showed you.

138
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,130
And you can see there's a lot of variety.

139
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,060
Some of them are extremely interesting, this
one from Haiti with minute details.

140
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,840
And some are more bold like this one from
China which is an emblem that pops out at

141
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,090
you from among the rest.

142
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:49,680
So, let's talk about some of the things that
are done well in a lens of modern standards

143
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
of accessibility.

144
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,589
And, again, there's no right and wrong because
these are works of art.

145
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:58,520
We're just choosing to look at them within
this particular framework.

146
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,050
So, generally these are pretty easily distinguishable.

147
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,700
So, these are some heraldic symbols from Germany.

148
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,370
And there are some similarities like the use
of the crown or the lion in some of them.

149
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,589
But if two of them were side by side, I probably
would be able to tell them apart pretty easily.

150
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:17,960
Which is good.

151
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,060
There's generally good color contrast.

152
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,690
This example is from Egypt.

153
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,720
And it's got an object in the forefront against
a lighter background and the red lining.

154
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,110
I will point out if you had red will have
green color blindness, this is not ideal,

155
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,759
but it does have some good contrast.

156
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,290
There's evidence of clear themes, specifically
within regions for a lot of these.

157
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,269
And a good example is the Japanese Mon.

158
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:50,720
One example, you can see that there's a blossom
and that symbolizes the renewal of life.

159
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,510
Often, they're recognizable even if someone
came from a different background.

160
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,399
In particular there's one with a sword, easy
to interpret.

161
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,050
An animal with bared teeth, that's pretty
understandable.

162
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,450
It's not a blanket rule, but in general they
have recognizable elements for people that

163
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,839
come from different backgrounds.

164
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,459
So, what are some things that could have been
done better in terms of modern standards of

165
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,600
accessibility?

166
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:41,790
This is an example.

167
00:11:41,790 --> 00:12:05,500
Recognizable elements for people from different
backgrounds.

168
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,440
So, what are some things that could have been
done standpoint.

169
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,000
Could provide a description of what this looks
like.

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,040
But obviously it's intended to be a visual
thing.

171
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,709
You might think of the audible equivalent
as like a battle cry or something like that

172
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,279
as you're going into battle.

173
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,649
Or maybe a song.

174
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,009
Readability is not always great.

175
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:35,550
So, this is a coat of arms from Portugal that's
been printed ton some fabric.

176
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,259
It's beautiful look at, but it's hard it make
out the letters on the bottom there.

177
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,949
So, not superreadable.

178
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:45,279
Some of them are very complex.

179
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,399
Like this one from imperial Russia.

180
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,190
So, if I were to print this into a book and
able to look at all the details with a magnifying

181
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,350
glass, that would be interesting.

182
00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:00,990
But on a coat of arms, a lot of this detail
would probably get lost.

183
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,610
Great.

184
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,630
Let's talk about what lessons we can take
away from some of these designs and some of

185
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,190
the problems they faced.

186
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:13,320
So, a big one is the meaning and unintended
meaning behind various symbols.

187
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,470
So, while I was researching this talk, I read
a paper from some students at Kansas State

188
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:25,570
University opt meaning of Chinese symbols
and what they mean in nonChinese cultures.

189
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:33,310
They gave a meaning of a fish, a symbol of
good luck and joy in China and is often used

190
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,790
in business logos as a result.

191
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,079
But if you were to apply this in a more western
context, a lot of times those are only used

192
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,950
in a logo geared towards children or a restaurant.

193
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,770
You could see where this could be confusing.

194
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:52,209
If I put a fish into my coat of arms and I
wanted to symbolize good luck and someone

195
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:57,410
from a western background saw it and thought
that my house was selling sushi.

196
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:04,579
Even symbols like animals that can seem clear
to us often have specific cultural connotations.

197
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:09,810
The international standard of organizations
provides some guidelines on symbols.

198
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:17,819
Stay away from hand gestures, religious symbols
and animals which can be ambiguous culturally.

199
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:22,399
You can use nature symbols in general like
sun or rain or flowers.

200
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,560
Graphics that are officially recognized by
the ISO and symbols that represent things

201
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,139
like equipment or transportation.

202
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,949
So, something like a truck or a hammer would
be pretty safe.

203
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:37,640
Abstract shapes like circles and squares are
also good choices.

204
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,279
I mentioned the international organization
of standards.

205
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,810
That's a body that was established by the
U.N. and is headquartered in Geneva.

206
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:53,139
Their purpose is to develop highquality standards
which facilitates exchange of goods, supports

207
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:57,380
growth, promote innovation and protect health,
safety and the environment.

208
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,399
So, you're probably familiar with some of
the icons that they've standardized.

209
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,330
They're things that are used in safety context
or on roads signs, at airports.

210
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,569
They can be things like hospital and no diving
sign.

211
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:15,389
And you can see by looking at these that they're
meant to be have a universal meaning.

212
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:20,389
You don't need to speak a particular language
to understand these.

213
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:25,310
I think another case study when it comes to
the meaning of symbols is interesting to look

214
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,540
at, the Mon from Japan.

215
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,560
I talked about earlier the blossom is the
symbol of the renewal of life.

216
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,939
If I came from somewhere else, I might be
able to guess that.

217
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:39,019
Plant life is frequently correlated with renewal
of life.

218
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:43,199
But it might be harder to understand not having
the right background.

219
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,899
There are others like this one in the top
right is four diamonds which might be unclear

220
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,259
to me at first glance.

221
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:55,000
So, some of these symbols are specific to
a particular region.

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,949
Another important lesson that we can take
away from heraldic design is the importance

223
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:01,779
of establishing a framework for your user.

224
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:07,329
As you probably know, we as human beings are
really good at recognizing patterns and dealing

225
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:08,670
with patterns.

226
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,740
And you see this in UI design or good UI design
with things like a menu which is pretty consistent

227
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,439
between websites.

228
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:19,620
That's very helpful to me if I need to go
to a website and find something that the navigation

229
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,510
is consistent.

230
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,850
And an example of this in heraldic design,
a lot of them had a very strict format for

231
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,850
a coat of arms.

232
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,570
So, this is a more western one and it shows
the helmet and two supporters and the battle

233
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,839
crier, a slogan across the stop.

234
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,629
If I studied these and I was very familiar
with their anatomy, I could read this and

235
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,819
look at a coat of arms and say, okay, the
supporters of this house are this and this

236
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:49,939
is the motto, and this is where everything
goes.

237
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:53,850
It's also good to remember that as sick as
you are of design, your users are not going

238
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,540
to be as sick of it.

239
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,079
This is called Jacob's Law of the Internet
User.

240
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:03,970
And basically, if you're looking at your own
website for maybe one hour or a couple hours

241
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,070
every single day, everyone your most active
users are only spending a couple of minutes.

242
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:13,880
So, in the course of a month you can imagine
that you would have maybe 30 hours of time

243
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,550
spent looking at your website whereas your
user would only have maybe 15 minutes or so.

244
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,220
And as a result, you might be sick of the
design and think that you need a refresh,

245
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,360
but your user doesn't have nearly the same
exposure to it.

246
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,820
So, it's a good thing to keep in mind in design
in general.

247
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,560
And heavily related, they've done Studies
that find that users actually like feeling

248
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,340
pretty exposed to a website.

249
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,630
So, you might think that they want a new and
edgy experience, but in reality, they probably

250
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:48,300
like feel like they know exactly how your
website works.

251
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,780
Another important lesson that we can learn
from heraldic design is the importance of

252
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,780
simplicity.

253
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,190
So, this is I think a good lesson from someone
named Steve Krug.

254
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:05,020
And he referred to users of the web as sharks
who have essentially going along and trying

255
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,850
to accomplish a specific thing.

256
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,050
And then they accomplish that and have to
keep going.

257
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,650
If they stop, they'll die.

258
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,250
They have to keep swimming.

259
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,670
If you can imagine your users when they go
to your website with not trying to stop and

260
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,670
smell the roses.

261
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,280
They're trying to accomplish one specific
thing.

262
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,840
And however, you can help them do that will
be good.

263
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,960
So, this is an example of where complexity
won out.

264
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,150
This is the 1915 code of arms for the AustriaHungarian
empire.

265
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,950
There's a lot going down here.

266
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:44,450
They got into the tradition of passing down
history in the coat of arms and there's a

267
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:51,280
bunch of flags and symbols jumbled together
here to the point that it's hard to get meaning

268
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,020
from looking at it.

269
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,510
It's obviously very interesting and if you
know what's going on, I'm sure it tells an

270
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,130
interesting story.

271
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:05,440
But might have been better to favor simplicity,
depending on your purpose.

272
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,620
Another important lesson that we can take
away is related to complex text flow.

273
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,390
So, maybe you've had this experience as an
engineer where you get your beige laid out

274
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,690
just right and everything looks awesome.

275
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,870
And then you add one word and all of a sudden
there's a line break.

276
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,800
And everything has been changed and it looks
horrible.

277
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,890
So, this is one of the examples of why text
flow is really hard to deal with.

278
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,690
In particular if you're changing the language
as well.

279
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,130
That's an added complication.

280
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,810
And in heraldic design there's a similar corollary.

281
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,390
I have to explain something first.

282
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,080
So, if I were a night going into battle, the
right side is the Dexter side and the left

283
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,800
side is the sinister side.

284
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,620
On a coat of arms, it looks like this, the
user's right side is their Dexter side and

285
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:55,340
the left side is the left is the feminine
and the right side is more masculine.

286
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:02,360
It ma tern signs go on the left.

287
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,490
They would put them together.

288
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,820
These are two coats of arms, one with Munich
and one from Frankfurt.

289
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,260
If I combine them, it looks like this.

290
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,330
You lose a lot of the original design.

291
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,880
Then we get this practice called impalement,
which is a form of heraldic combination or

292
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,520
marshaling of two coats of arms.

293
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,050
It's a little bit more nuanced.

294
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,750
This is an example of a composition of different
symbols that I think is more effective.

295
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,660
On the left you see the three blossoms here
which is representing one thing.

296
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,680
And then in the middle you have the two lions
which is another house.

297
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,030
And then on the right you have the bugles
and the crosses.

298
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:49,870
So, this is an example of how you could combine
several symbols in a more thought out approach

299
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,880
that ends up being more effective than just
kind of shopping them in the middle and sticking

300
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
them together.

301
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,290
And I think this is heavily correlated to
what it's like to deal with text sometimes.

302
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,130
There's not a clean way to chop it.

303
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,530
Often you have to think carefully about composing
elements.

304
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:12,660
And the bottom line it's hard, often it can
be like the diary page with text everywhere.

305
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,770
There's no one size fits all solution.

306
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,630
Specialization will be necessary in your approach.

307
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:27,990
To wrap up, if you take anything away from
this talk, try and favor simplicity over complexity.

308
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,630
It's a good idea to accomplish familiar frameworks
for your user.

309
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,011
And consider the meaning that your symbols
might have, particularly for people from a

310
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,420
different background.

311
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,680
So, if you take anything away, those are the
three things that I would hope that you remember.

312
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,790
And, again, I did Tweet out these slides.

313
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,240
Thank you for coming.

314
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,830
And I think we'll have some time for questions.
