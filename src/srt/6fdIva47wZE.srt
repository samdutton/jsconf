00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,260

I

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,710
today I'm going to talk about animating

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,700
SVG's and the main bulk of it is about

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,830
SVG's and i'll show you how to animate

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,740
with different methods possible before i

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,570
begin care have a show of hands how many

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,210
people use SVG is really cool nice

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,169
alright how many people know how the

9
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:36,850
enemy as you choose with CSS nice SI my

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:42,870
sm IL not a lot ok great and javascript

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:51,280
ok cool so good so I'm Zell and just I'm

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,330
not going to talk a lot about myself

13
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,519
because I have a lot to cover so just

14
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,470
two quick things I wrote two books one

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,870
is learning Suzy which teaches you how

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,760
to use a Suzy framework and the other is

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,799
automating your workflow and you can

18
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,010
find me at my website zell dash week 8

19
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,060
com or my 200 Zelda with you I have no

20
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,450
idea why I put that your eyes my I don't

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,890
know I'm thinking when I created a

22
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,310
website but anyway so the slides are

23
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,770
going to be up on this link if you want

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,490
it so grab you later and so today we are

25
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,979
going to go through the basic SG stuff a

26
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:29,890
very very quick one then some animation

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,140
methods to see how we can enemy refugees

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,179
then we are going to go into more

29
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:37,060
complex one and then we're going to see

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,149
some cool real-world effects very

31
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:43,899
quickly let's go into the basics so why

32
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,109
svgs I believe in using SDGs because it

33
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,119
has good use good browser support

34
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,789
basically any browser support svcs right

35
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:54,819
now it's star level it's highly soluble

36
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:57,280
and do a lot of things with it and the

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,319
best of the best of all is scalable

38
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,659
meaning you can build animations for the

39
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,700
mobile for the desktop and beyond it's

40
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,840
up to you going to the basics there are

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,869
multiple ways of using SVG's for example

42
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,590
using it as an image tag or a CSS

43
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,980
background-image like this or an object

44
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,769
tag which i don't see many people using

45
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:24,160
it and inline SVG

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,240
and well multiple methods we're not

47
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,950
going to cover so much from the basics

48
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,740
in this talk right now so we're going to

49
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,350
just use inline SVG's because it's the

50
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,200
one that supports everything just to

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,800
make our lives easier so animations

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,150
methods they are basic skate 3 CSS sm IL

53
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,620
which stands for synchronized multimedia

54
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,680
integration language and javascript

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,360
browser support for this korean

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,840
emissions are pretty good CSS is IE 9

57
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,820
plus so as long as you can use CSS

58
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,300
transitions animations you're fine SM al

59
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,040
if you are going to support IE 0 or

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,210
prime mini you well you can use it and

61
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,470
javascript has the best support so far

62
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,260
it goes way back to even I use six if

63
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,220
you use some like some good libraries so

64
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,130
the first part is hilarious talk about

65
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,050
translation meaning like moving disease

66
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,720
from left to right and rotation you see

67
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,180
why rotation and in a while because it's

68
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,290
a little bit complex first of all here's

69
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,080
the SVG we are going to use this is the

70
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,420
square that we have cool so if i run

71
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,140
this you see a square hopefully yeah ask

72
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,600
away okay animating with CSS first of

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,390
all you want to use CSS when your

74
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,010
animations are simple we do have a lot

75
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,020
of different weird timing functions you

76
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,760
don't have to think too much about the

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,100
lazy and stuff like that and you want to

78
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,709
any properties that only CSS can animate

79
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,140
which is most of them except for the

80
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,550
past date harting things like that when

81
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,950
targeting SDGs in CSS you can either

82
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,830
target the SVG element that works very

83
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,020
very much like the same as HTML div

84
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,820
elements so we are not going to go into

85
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,580
that the other one is to target the

86
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,370
elements within the SDG itself there's

87
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,750
slightly more complex when it comes to

88
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,460
animations because things start to

89
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,910
change a bit so first of all translation

90
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,520
I believe many people you already know

91
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,190
how to use transitions so

92
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,010
melling don't have a debt but

93
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,270
transitions if you say if you do a

94
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,220
transform you're basically moving it to

95
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,310
the left by our pixels you can also use

96
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,150
animations like the important thing to

97
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,250
notice the keyframes over here if you

98
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,630
know the cleveland syntax you can

99
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,850
basically do animations just like

100
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,450
transitions in with SVG's nothing to

101
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,750
worry about so the left and right thing

102
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,390
is pretty simple however when it comes

103
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,790
to rotation is not as straightforward as

104
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,790
it so right here I've written rotate 360

105
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,360
degrees so take a look at how this SDG&E

106
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,710
runs it's kind of because it goes out of

107
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,110
the box and then it comes back again if

108
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,850
you notice it it hovers over this H over

109
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,890
here so this is the orange endpoint of

110
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,910
the SVG transition well if you want to

111
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,860
translate at the center we have to set

112
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,470
the transform origin to fifty fifty

113
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,970
percent and hey it works however the

114
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,650
problem is that this doesn't work in

115
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,200
firefox if you're not working if you

116
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,760
understood working in firefox you have

117
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,580
to set the transform origin to pixels or

118
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,300
any other unit that firefox use this so

119
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,270
if you are going to do rotation with SVG

120
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,790
animations the best not to use CSS if

121
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,780
you want to support Firefox then let's

122
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,910
go on to SMI elbow you'll be going to do

123
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,910
the same thing you want to use SML

124
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,430
likewise when you use simple animations

125
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,310
you need slightly more control compared

126
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,760
to CSS you'll see why later and you'd

127
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,530
like to support IE or prime mini the

128
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,410
enemy similar animations you can use the

129
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,570
enemy tech basically similar animations

130
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,220
you're going to use you're going to

131
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,280
write it in the SDG itself it's kind of

132
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,980
like writing HTML and inline styles at

133
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,460
the same time so you can you either put

134
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,290
it within the element like this is the

135
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,360
rectangle we have earlier and animate

136
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,289
take within or you can use an ID and use

137
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,849
a hitch rack link to the ID

138
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:51,490
so the enemy Tech has need to tether

139
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,710
needs to have a minimum of four things

140
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,110
the attribute name which is the thing

141
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,479
that you want to move around the front

142
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,860
value the two value and the duration so

143
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,490
I remember saying that you need even is

144
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,530
slightly more control you can use simul

145
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,659
it gets against a like click and then it

146
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:14,319
moves here we are moving X which is the

147
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,930
location from the 02 the current

148
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,879
position it's like a translation thing

149
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,280
by 100 pixels or 100 SVG units there is

150
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,370
also another form of using simul and

151
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,669
that is with the enemy transform tag the

152
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,009
addition is that you have to have a type

153
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:35,620
of say translate on rutila things like

154
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,240
that and this is the x and y values

155
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,409
likewise you can say click and it

156
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,949
translates now next moving on to

157
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:48,039
rotation and when you rotate you have to

158
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,930
use any may transform tag because you're

159
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,630
going to transform it no other methods

160
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,969
otherwise likewise when you click on it

161
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:57,009
it slides all the window and comes back

162
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,490
again this is because it rotates around

163
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,289
the top left on it now we can fix it by

164
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:09,729
setting the central origin right in the

165
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,400
signal element self by sandia say a

166
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,870
hundred and it rotates properly so this

167
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,819
is slightly more confusing because you

168
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,400
have to like count the pixels in there

169
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,949
as well it's not so helpful if you're

170
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:26,440
going to work on rotations the way to

171
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,889
write more than one animation in Samuel

172
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,709
is that you have to add new text and you

173
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:35,260
can chain them together by using an ID

174
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,329
on the previous animation and then say

175
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:39,640
begin so I click on this if it will

176
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,430
rotate next I'll change color so this is

177
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,709
how severe animation goes next let's

178
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,790
move on to JavaScript we use JavaScript

179
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,529
you can use it for complex animations

180
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,010
like the one else the CSS thing that was

181
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,660
shown just now there was mostly

182
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,899
JavaScript and some CSS it supports all

183
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,070
browsers we don't

184
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,560
have to worry about it and rotating

185
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,420
SVG's obviously because it's a lot

186
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,750
simpler you see the libraries that you

187
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,040
can use to enemy svgs a tree sap and

188
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,470
stamp SVG there are also other libraries

189
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,940
you can use but we are going to use G

190
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,430
set because animation is much simpler

191
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,540
with reset and la colina so first of all

192
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,520
we are going to add the twin max thing

193
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:30,340
in G set by using the below code the GSF

194
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,150
syntax is like this twin max dot method

195
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,760
elements the duration and your

196
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,590
destination how you look like at the end

197
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,170
of the animation so let's say we are

198
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,670
doing translation that means twin x 2

199
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,430
we're going to rotate to the s3 bill

200
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,180
which is specifically for SVG's so we're

201
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,310
going to translate the exit from 50 to

202
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,470
100 right now and we click on it it goes

203
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,820
like this rotation likewise if you put

204
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,770
like rotation 360 straight away it will

205
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,320
rotate around its own origin which is

206
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,090
slightly different from the other

207
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,090
properties but you can set transform

208
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,070
origin to 5050 and you will work

209
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,300
flawlessly in all browsers now if in the

210
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,880
rare case you need to rotate around the

211
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,490
SVG origin you can say set to aren't

212
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,930
tomorrow which is the bottom right

213
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,850
corner and it flow out and come back in

214
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,340
again so this works in all browsers as

215
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,300
well well now we are done with the

216
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,000
basics I hope that wasn't too fast so

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,010
this one we are going to make something

218
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,710
more complex so because my friend Jing

219
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,180
here likes to play basketball we are

220
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,700
going to do a basketball animation that

221
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,940
goes like this so if you notice there is

222
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,360
a translate X which goes from left to

223
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,640
right there is a balance animation so

224
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,370
translate y and then that's a rotating

225
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,000
animation at the same time in this one

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,820
the SVG for the ball is pretty huge

227
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,860
there's three paths elements so we're

228
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,260
going to copy it and put it into the

229
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,900
cold pan

230
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,690
no all right there you have the Balkans

231
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,250
yeah see you see that for CSS when

232
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,240
you're walking with the ball in your

233
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,320
mission because we are going to use

234
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,560
transforms all along it's an easier way

235
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,570
if you wish we add more group classes so

236
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,430
you catch more elements to play with so

237
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,010
one way of doing it is like this I'm

238
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:40,860
going to do a quick one

239
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,790
and then we're going to close some tax

240
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,750
I'm not going to worry about indentation

241
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,589
right now so now for CSS i'm going to

242
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:54,720
use animations because when you're using

243
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,060
bounce is going to be hard to set the

244
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,350
easing function so in ball x regular and

245
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,620
it hit from left to right and ball why

246
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,600
we are going to bounce it and borrow

247
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,850
typical and rotate it around its origin

248
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,829
so take know that because we are using

249
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:13,290
funds from origin fifty-fifty it doesn't

250
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,820
work in firefox the keyframes for ball x

251
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,649
and ball rotate is pretty

252
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,680
straightforward so you can paste it down

253
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,800
here boy axis moves it to the left ball

254
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,890
wide that's ball religious rotates it so

255
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:33,560
here it rotates perfect now the CSS for

256
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,630
this one is slightly more complex like

257
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,959
you have to count the different timings

258
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,579
and then you have to give the correct

259
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,740
translation to it and you have to set

260
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,050
the timing functions to easing and ease

261
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,209
out properly otherwise the ball doesn't

262
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:51,630
balance so now if you run it you have to

263
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,060
look at this whoa oh I think I had a

264
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,880
typo error here all right doesn't seem

265
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,300
to work properly okay there's a ball why

266
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,750
and here's an a missing oh really yeah

267
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,490
its role in the CSS at the time oh ok

268
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,829
thanks so now if I click click run it

269
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:22,200
drops you can see that animation is

270
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,709
slightly jerky no way because it's hard

271
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:28,950
to gather any missions correct have a

272
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,660
look at once again it's kind of jerky

273
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,070
because it's hard to calculate the

274
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,810
timing functions and how it translates

275
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,610
and start a bit now let's move on oh

276
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,930
this is this is the one I was supposed

277
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,970
to show you anyway

278
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,590
great now as we go on to SM al we're

279
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,740
going to rotate it the same way so one

280
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,080
is going to be x1 it's going to be why

281
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,720
and once we need rotate likewise we are

282
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,970
going to use three different groups but

283
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,830
instead of using classes we have to use

284
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,440
IDs because this is the only way to

285
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,080
select stuff in samil so let me just

286
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:17,150
switch over hands set this to class IDs

287
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,190
okay great so bowl x will be and you

288
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:26,400
make transform well X and you set it to

289
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,490
let me just remove all of this okay and

290
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,130
you may transform ball x from 0 to six

291
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:40,270
hundred for 2.5 seconds so now it it

292
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,830
translates properly so that's good now

293
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,960
for rotate we are going to rotate it

294
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,050
around its origin at 50 50 likewise just

295
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:58,390
2.5 seconds so like this technology we

296
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,920
have to use and you may transform over

297
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:07,630
here and for poor why this is the killer

298
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,120
part because you have to transform it

299
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,100
and transfer you have to translate it

300
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,100
from up to down the values you see here

301
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,710
are like timing functions sorry the key

302
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,270
times here is like timing functions that

303
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,570
we have in the keyframes so this is

304
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,100
fourteen percent twenty-eight percent

305
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,250
and so on and the values here is a wide

306
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,950
translate value and the X translate

307
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,050
value so we have to like bounce it up

308
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,530
and down then you have to set the count

309
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,550
mode the key spline which stands for

310
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,410
bezier curves and stuff like that then

311
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,380
you have to copy and paste the Bezier

312
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,680
curve itself into the simul it's going

313
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,090
to be a pain in the ass if you have to

314
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,480
read we use this animation so let's just

315
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,590
copy it over and go into it

316
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:05,750
now refresh great we have something like

317
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,450
the CSS ball that we have the

318
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,520
calculations are exactly the same so you

319
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,230
see that the it bounces a little bit

320
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,840
show clearly as well because we have to

321
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,010
calculate the whole thing by ourselves

322
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,890
next with JavaScript with javascript is

323
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,840
a lot simpler because we don't have to

324
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,300
worry about all the different transforms

325
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,300
and translate g700 for us without a

326
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,050
problem so we can just use a class so I

327
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,910
mean I'm just going to come back here

328
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,910
and remove both X and bo why I'm going

329
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,040
to give a class of what i call it

330
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,550
borrowed here all right and we're going

331
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:58,490
to remove the anime transforms and the

332
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:04,970
extra key tags all right so if we head

333
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,480
back into the JavaScript let me just

334
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,940
copy this over first and then we'll

335
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:16,400
explain in here okay so in here we are

336
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,730
using two different timing functions the

337
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,430
first one will be easing will be at ease

338
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,520
out at the same time it's going to

339
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,970
translate it from left to right and

340
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:34,000
rotate it so if we run and click on this

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,560
it rotates and it translates properly

342
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,410
the second one at the same time we're

343
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,960
going to do a bounce with a using

344
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:49,330
function and now if I run it Oh

345
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,440
and click on it you see that it bounces

346
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,110
and you also notice that the East thing

347
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,120
is a lot easier to control because we

348
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,160
can use easing libraries instead of

349
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,700
trying to call it one ourselves so using

350
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,730
g-type is a lot simpler than using CSS

351
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,500
animations or JavaScript and new inches

352
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,580
when you have something of this kind now

353
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,790
let's move on to some cooler real-world

354
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,650
effects the ones that we are going to

355
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,640
talk about our line drawing and shape

356
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,850
more thing so line drawing you'll see

357
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,050
something like this I mean it draws by

358
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,400
itself the method for doing this is that

359
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,470
you have to use SVG with a stroke if it

360
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,700
doesn't have a stroke this method

361
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,830
doesn't work so let's just remove

362
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,540
everything else and just place the SVG

363
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:47,030
in no way I don't need this ok the first

364
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,460
step of the line drawing thing is to

365
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,060
divide the strokes into a race into

366
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,640
smaller pieces by using a stroke dash

367
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:01,640
array property in CSS next you have to

368
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,480
offset the stroke slightly by saying by

369
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,090
using a stroke death offset method the

370
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,850
numbers here are calculations that you

371
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,890
just are just random numbers that you

372
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,920
can use so if you move over it it really

373
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,690
kind of looks cool just that it doesn't

374
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,500
have the full line by itself then you

375
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,360
have to make the strokes longer so it

376
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,610
covers the full path so these numbers

377
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,310
are you have to go and try and calculate

378
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,940
it by yourself so this is kind of like

379
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,510
the different way so if we want to make

380
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,790
it the correct way around with to set

381
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,490
the stroke dash offset says so it

382
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,460
doesn't show up and we animate it in on

383
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,830
transformer on animations alright so for

384
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,990
line drawing in summary which is going

385
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,390
to set the dash array to the path length

386
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,090
and the dash all set to the path length

387
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,820
as well the challenging part with this

388
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,430
is getting the path lane without and

389
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,930
making sure

390
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,300
it works across all browsers and all the

391
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,340
devices especially when responsive

392
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,950
design comes in play so this is usually

393
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,900
easier with libraries you can use your

394
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,320
own JavaScript method to call the SVG

395
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,360
path and get the total length of the

396
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,760
path or you can use some libraries like

397
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,550
fever CS we should enemy a multiple

398
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,500
paths or you directly without any

399
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,260
problems or you can use something like a

400
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,590
preset draw SVG plugin or segment which

401
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,620
is very new it works exactly the same su

402
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,770
set as we g0 plugin with the exception

403
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,800
that you have to pay for it then the

404
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,830
only the good thing about this draws VG

405
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,600
thing is that you can start your path

406
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,970
anywhere and if you animate it however

407
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,280
you like so if i take if you take a look

408
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,590
here i started a path from the middle

409
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,710
and then roast it up and that is not

410
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,350
very doable with library site vapors

411
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,100
unless you really hack your way through

412
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,370
alright that's for a line drawing so

413
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,990
we're going to go into shape more thing

414
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,670
for shame of me am I going to do this

415
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:12,560
well um this is well i got from co drops

416
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,000
so it's pretty cool if you don't know

417
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,880
code drops please have a lot here be

418
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,260
your mind will be blown by the

419
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,110
animations they have in there so the

420
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,690
trick to use to doing this Boing Boing

421
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,390
thing is that need to have a starting

422
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,210
path and the path when you click on it

423
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,090
so like the ending path the main thing

424
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,580
here is that the path the number of

425
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,280
points in the past must match all the

426
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,830
way I mean by that so if you know some

427
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,080
SDGs you'll know that m starts for

428
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,210
stands for movie tall which is the start

429
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,850
of a path and then if you take the

430
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,980
number of lines here she is one thing

431
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,840
just look at the alphabet so you know

432
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,880
how many points they are this s and

433
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,300
that's s so that's like 44 points here

434
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,820
yes MC s 1 s s and that's another s

435
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,040
somewhere here so that's four points in

436
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,260
both methods then there are two ways to

437
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,320
do this you can use G sets move SVG

438
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,560
plugin which is paid once again or you

439
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,610
can use snap

440
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,730
ji ji ji said natively doesn't allow you

441
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,420
to work with past very well oh yeah

442
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,770
there's one more way to do this and

443
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,080
that's the ISA meal but when your past

444
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,400
messes up you'll be so let's do how

445
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,620
it works right now with the morph SVG

446
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,750
plugin this is pit so right now we're

447
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,780
doing here is that we have a stat path

448
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,179
which is the circular one and the end

449
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:47,390
path which is the the oval one we're

450
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,730
going to set visibility to hidden so we

451
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,410
don't see the over one then we're going

452
00:22:54,410 --> 00:23:03,440
to click on the more the button we're

453
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,100
going to set the start to the end so the

454
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,929
cool thing about morph SVG is that you

455
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:13,280
can set it to the IV of the path that

456
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,809
you want it to moth into so let me just

457
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:23,059
remove this and take a look so I do a

458
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,570
run now it will move in there and stay

459
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,610
it right there without any problems just

460
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,950
the coolest part about the morph SVG

461
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,610
plugin then now if I want to bring it

462
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,809
back then we just have to set a delay or

463
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:41,390
if you use time there are other methods

464
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,730
but this one is simple we can just set a

465
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,190
delay so and it bounces back after that

466
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,960
so something like this quite simple with

467
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,380
both SVG but of course some of us are

468
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,679
calling our misers like myself included

469
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,380
oh wait let me just talk about this like

470
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,140
remember I was saying that all the

471
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,230
challenges with morphing part shapes is

472
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,700
that you have to have the same number of

473
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,100
paths I'm sorry the similar points on

474
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,530
the path well the good thing about more

475
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,360
of SVG is that you can forget about that

476
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,070
and this is the only library where you

477
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,370
can do so like soco to elephant and

478
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,000
rhino to star and back into an elephant

479
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,929
and to a circle again this is there's a

480
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:28,940
lot of complex path especially with the

481
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,970
rhino and elephant

482
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,830
but it's simple when it comes to the

483
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,170
SoCo and the star well if you are

484
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,660
working with SVG if you are creating an

485
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,060
SVG yourself this is going to be hell a

486
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,310
lot of work but if you used rice which

487
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,050
she doesn't worry about it and they will

488
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,150
animate for you automatically so this is

489
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,620
pretty cool anyway for the if you don't

490
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,380
pay money like me so you can use snap

491
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,550
lcg which is following this link here 00

492
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,260
i have a link up there so you can click

493
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,350
on it if you want to so in this case we

494
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,930
are going to do it slightly differently

495
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,600
we're just going to have a path that is

496
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,630
the initial shape so I'm just going to

497
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,370
replace everything and remove everything

498
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:16,740
here all right we have to circle once

499
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,150
again then just make it simple we're

500
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,920
going to say we're going to specify the

501
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,080
start and end pop and JavaScript you can

502
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,780
make it nicer by setting it on an

503
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,950
attribute of the element if you want to

504
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,620
so we're going to initialize nap and

505
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,920
then select the path which is kind of

506
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,530
what it requires then the start and end

507
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:45,000
path night when we click on the button

508
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,250
for the first time we have to make the

509
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,490
oval shape so this is done by using the

510
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,970
enemy method the mena here is the easing

511
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:59,190
function provided by step SVG traveling

512
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:05,190
oh my god so the using function here is

513
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,590
provided by Nina it's kinda like ji

514
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,130
sub's easing function with us I think

515
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,800
it's not as powerful but you can't use G

516
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:19,020
set with as standby so he just like this

517
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,210
right now so you can do that then once

518
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,720
it's completed we can pass on a next

519
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,310
parameter which is the on complete

520
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,250
function and then we animate it back to

521
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,010
the start path so this is how we can do

522
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:40,899
it so I'm just going to copy it a reflex

523
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:46,340
okay cool now if you take a look at this

524
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,330
once again it goes by own again so the

525
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,330
the thing about stem SVG is that you

526
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,919
might think that stem SVG doesn't play

527
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:57,620
very well with she said that's kind of

528
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,740
true you can also call it this key self

529
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,720
has this whole thing that you can use

530
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,470
the call snap SVG animation method but

531
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,750
it's going to go one way so you can do

532
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,730
complex animations regarding that so

533
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,230
just be aware of it if you want to

534
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,460
combine the two of them then just a

535
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,070
quick summary the more thing

536
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,960
your past must has the same number of

537
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,419
points for the initial and ending path

538
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:27,590
unless you are using more SVG and yeah

539
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:35,789
with that come to the end of the talk I

540
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:39,169
noticed you used a lot of default

541
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,750
timings like easing out and so on is

542
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,429
that something you'd normally do or

543
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:45,919
would usually customize them well I

544
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,649
normally do use the default easing

545
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:51,769
functions because I find that it's more

546
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:55,220
important to select the right timing

547
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,590
rather than the easing functions because

548
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,360
of the easing functions are they are

549
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,490
really pretty good so the more important

550
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,200
things is to set the delays of the

551
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,580
animation and the timings of the

552
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,429
animation correct rather than play

553
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:10,129
around the eating of course if you are a

554
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:11,870
pro with the eating stuff feel free to

555
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,850
play with it I'm not that good of that

556
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:20,330
personally yeah I saw that a chrome is

557
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,570
actually deprecating the SMI o syntax

558
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,950
yeah so would you suggest not using that

559
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,860
at all well personally I don't really

560
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,220
like the sm Hale syntax myself because

561
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,440
you can't use it like across multiple

562
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,210
elements you have to copy and paste it

563
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,870
and it's going to be deprecated into web

564
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,629
animations API which I unfortunately

565
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:47,559
haven't had a chance to look into yet I

566
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,769
would believe that I would 46 SML and

567
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:53,720
use JavaScript or CSS animations

568
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,270
stay as much as possible and have a look

569
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,270
at web animations API once it stabilizes

570
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,620
and take a look at how that goes I just

571
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,570
want to ask you about the performers own

572
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,440
mobile phone as I know the mobile

573
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,630
browser or whether you or all the

574
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,430
message to wrong as which you will cost

575
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,620
some serious fed drugging and other

576
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,400
performers issue so are you worried

577
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,800
about performance issue is it's an

578
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,720
actual issue we have encountered so I

579
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,190
just wonder if you have some tests or

580
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,060
project using mobile devices yeah um

581
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,760
currently no I don't have like projects

582
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,730
that I street where I use mobile

583
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,400
animation straightaway but so far from

584
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,640
my test it depends on how you use the

585
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,900
animations yourself so like if you use

586
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,410
transforms and don't repaint the browser

587
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,120
as much as possible it's not too much of

588
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,550
a problem or you can use gchat which is

589
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,460
amazing because it works very well with

590
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,290
purpose and as performance is absolutely

591
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,770
solid so for me i'll probably just to

592
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,620
lay around with this two methods and see

593
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,170
whether it works well or not if it's

594
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,990
really shitty then I guess the

595
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,640
animations might be a bit too much or

596
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,640
maybe try to cut down animations because

597
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,530
if you are using a mobile browser and

598
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,950
you need to reach out to depot with at a

599
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,840
high speed and they don't have to

600
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,690
internet connection then maybe dead part

601
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,330
is not so important after all or maybe

602
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,970
it might be it depends on what you're
