1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550

hi there everybody so I do realize I'm

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,959
the last thing between you guys and

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,750
lunch so I'm gonna try and be as brief

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,010
as I can

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,660
we're gonna be talking about building

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,840
voice you eyes using JavaScript just a

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,960
couple of slides on Who I am my name is

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,859
memo that is actually my real name I am

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,710
from Mexico and I love sneakers so those

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,240
are three things about me if you ever

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,560
want to talk about any of those things

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,590
I'm available for that oh and I use

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,869
JavaScript weird so I don't make

14
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,620
webpages I don't know a lot about

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,320
client-side JavaScript my whole

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,719
experience with javascript is node

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,350
server list for voice when I joined the

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,180
Alexa team I really hadn't ever done

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,649
JavaScript development I came over from

20
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,670
a different company that used a

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,710
different technology stack but these

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,570
three years have been an incredible ride

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,090
it's been a lot of fun I'm really happy

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,739
that I get to work on the stuff that I

25
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,640
get to work we like to use this slide to

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,220
talk about you is so voice you eyes are

27
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,180
a big thing for Amazon we really truly

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,119
believe in these we think they are going

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
to change how we interact with computers

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,380
what we don't believe is that they're

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,060
here to kill all the other user

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,040
interfaces you might have seen a lot of

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,689
clickbait articles at some point talking

34
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,939
about that that's just someone trying to

35
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,780
make a living out of your clicks so

36
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,909
we've all at some point used character

37
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,650
mode right we type something in there or

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,420
we've used the graphical user interface

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,390
most of us do web stuff web pages

40
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,210
definitely change the game when it came

41
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,579
to you eyes and mobile development and

42
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,009
react reactive design and all these

43
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,930
different things we're a big paradigm

44
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,990
shift so we've seen these changes go

45
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,909
along but I like to think about it a

46
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,820
little bit more like this where we have

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,479
multiple you eyes these exist but we

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,250
choose which one we use based on the

49
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,550
type of work we're doing I don't foresee

50
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,240
a future where I tell my

51
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,060
terminal to navigate to a specific

52
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,750
folder and then do NPM I - - save some

53
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,790
package right AASK - SDK from a language

54
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,550
perspective that is not how I talk and

55
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,940
also it is very hard to say and to hear

56
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,360
so there's going to be very different

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,670
user interfaces for very different tasks

58
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,650
and that's okay I'm just here to talk a

59
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,660
little bit about voice as a user

60
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,690
interface so the first thing I wanted to

61
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,510
talk about is how do Alexa scales

62
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,850
actually work so quick show of hands I

63
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,770
think I can see if I cover my eyes who's

64
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,780
built voice you UI of any sort alright a

65
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,460
couple a couple hands in there so you

66
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,470
guys are old pros I'm just gonna take

67
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,180
the rest of us on a quick little right

68
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,870
here about house voice skills on Alexa

69
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,660
work and the way it works is here's a

70
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,390
quick 10,000 foot view of it we got the

71
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,180
user on the left side we got your code

72
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,830
that you would deploy on the right side

73
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,660
in the middle we've got a handy-dandy

74
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,480
device called an echo and actually have

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,220
one up here and I'm gonna do a quick

76
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,250
little demo for you

77
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:31,910
Alexa start Cascadia Jas hi Cascadia Jas

78
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,670
it's almost lunchtime yeah okay so

79
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,050
that's that's a quick little demo that I

80
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,090
put together and actually if I tell it

81
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,620
to say goodbye right now it's gonna

82
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,180
explode there's gonna be an error and

83
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,250
I'm gonna try and live code that before

84
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,280
lunch so hopefully if demo gods are on

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,130
my side today so that's just some

86
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,780
JavaScript code that I deployed to a

87
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,440
lambda function hosted on AWS and it

88
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,890
just serverless code written in

89
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,390
JavaScript I'm actually taking advantage

90
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,530
of an NPM package called a SK - SDK

91
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,620
which is the LX SDK language that's

92
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,390
actually written in typescript but we're

93
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,930
not gonna ding him for that so how does

94
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,549
this actually working when I said

95
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,260
something to the device how did it

96
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,960
actually parse it I said something which

97
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,580
is very different than typing something

98
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,450
there

99
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,450
a good analogy for it is Ethernet versus

100
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,790
Wi-Fi if I connect an ethernet cable to

101
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,770
my computer I know that the data is

102
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,330
going from one end of the cable to the

103
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,830
other end of the cable if I'm connected

104
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,990
to Wi-Fi I'm transmitting radio signals

105
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,310
all over the room when they're bouncing

106
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,860
around that's why the speed on the Wi-Fi

107
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,770
at home is so crappy but voice is the

108
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,620
same way if I say something it bounces

109
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,900
are on this room and then it hits your

110
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,420
ears and then you do some natural

111
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,370
language understanding on it and then

112
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,070
you figure out what I meant to say Alexa

113
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,380
works the same way it's got a multiple

114
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,050
microphones on it and when they say for

115
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,650
miles

116
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,450
that's a phonetic spelling spelling for

117
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,870
for miles you are not too hungry that

118
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,150
your look seeing weird signs it's an

119
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,080
upside down Omega sign but that could

120
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,850
mean many things it could mean for

121
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,850
example for miles and we we parse that

122
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,610
based on a grammar and a language model

123
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,960
that I'm going to show you real quick in

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,810
a second and then we turn that into

125
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,600
everyone's favorite JSON so why use

126
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,060
JavaScript to build Alexa skills because

127
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,120
we turn all that language into a JSON

128
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,980
object and there's nothing that's easier

129
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,200
to work with than JavaScript and JSON

130
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,030
toads it should come very naturally to

131
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,330
you what we do is we turn what the user

132
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,180
said what we call an utterance into an

133
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,550
intent what the user meant what was

134
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,070
their intention and then we pass you a

135
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,050
JSON object that has the name of the

136
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,730
intent and might have some variables in

137
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,580
there so you can process that so or in

138
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,590
your code really all that's happening is

139
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,770
that you're taking some JSON you're

140
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,060
parsing it you're working with it and

141
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,820
then you're returning JSON that just

142
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,160
adheres to our standard and we do all

143
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,390
the heavy lifting for the voice

144
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,530
processing the natural language

145
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,440
understanding all these different things

146
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,320
is that a couple oh if this is a sample

147
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,320
of a JSON object that would be sent into

148
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,930
our code that one for example is in

149
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,970
Spanish so you'll see there's a tag

150
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,970
called locale and it's es - MX we're

151
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,760
very proud at Amazon to have support for

152
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,710
multiple languages I think we're at 15

153
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,770
right now and one thing to keep in mind

154
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,870
is you might see in the language

155
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,750
drop-down when you're

156
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,150
Alexus skill there's multiple English

157
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,770
models and people kind of tend to laugh

158
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,090
at it when they don't really think

159
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,890
through it because why do you need an

160
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,630
English model for Australia and an

161
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,310
English model for Ireland and an English

162
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,810
model for the US and an English model

163
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,350
for the UK beyond the just the acoustic

164
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,810
modeling of how we speak we call things

165
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,150
differently right so in the UK these

166
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,610
aren't pants right so if I tell someone

167
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,190
like hey you want to go with me and I'm

168
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,080
gonna go pants shopping it might be an

169
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,150
okay thing to do with my friend but if I

170
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,880
say that exact same sentence in the UK

171
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,850
I'm making a different proposition which

172
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,020
is do you want to come underwear

173
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,669
shopping with me and it'd have some

174
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:19,530
implications right so that's why we need

175
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,570
multiple language models in the Spanish

176
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,940
side I don't speak when I'm speaking in

177
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,010
Spanish like someone from Spain they

178
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,050
call shoes that I'm very fond off

179
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,000
sopla tedious that is what we call

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,760
ballet shoes in Mexico I would never say

181
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,470
that I'm into ballet shoes cuz I just

182
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,550
know I'm just not so it's it just Forks

183
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,290
and it grows and grows and grows so it's

184
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,850
really important to have these multiple

185
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,650
language models so we can capture input

186
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,690
accurately and the name of the game when

187
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,430
it comes to voice is accuracy and

188
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,450
context so this is describing the first

189
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,430
flow at the top there's a bunch of

190
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,740
different really complicated math and

191
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,270
compute it compute that's happening in

192
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,680
there the good news is you don't need to

193
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,140
do it it's a bit of a black box but it's

194
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,970
a toolbox for you that we already built

195
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,100
completely free to use what we use is

196
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,660
speech recognition so we're trying to

197
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,350
turn the audio that we got into text

198
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,390
then use machine learning and natural

199
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,479
language or understanding to understand

200
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,460
the meaning of that text reading so if

201
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,440
you said blue do you mean the color blue

202
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,580
blue or the verb blue and it kind of

203
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,950
balloons out of there on the right side

204
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,570
there's just some JavaScript code and

205
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,979
it's all just working with JSON on the

206
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,080
flip side so if you're going on the from

207
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,630
the back we're returning a response and

208
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,409
we're saying the output speech is okay

209
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,780
and the type is SS ml and we're get

210
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,300
we'll get to SS ml in a second ss ml

211
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,790
stands for speech synthesis markup

212
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,089
language you can think of it all

213
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,939
most like CSS for voice so when you

214
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:54,769
heard Alexis say YUM

215
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,589
it put a bunch of emphasis into that I'm

216
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,620
using SSM l to markup my speech when I'm

217
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,970
returning it to to our ears basically so

218
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,449
what it's doing here is gonna take that

219
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:10,399
object find what the actual output

220
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,970
speeches and then it'll say it and again

221
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,269
that's a phonetic spelling for okay and

222
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:18,860
that's what we'll hear and then

223
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,649
hopefully we'll try to our human brain

224
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:23,410
will parse it properly

225
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,930
so just final reminder of last time

226
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,670
we'll see this guy and it's that

227
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,420
everything that's happening at our

228
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,449
communicating with our service is JSON

229
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:40,220
and all our code is JavaScript

230
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,189
it's ghosted on AWS for in my case using

231
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:44,509
serverless technology which is lambda

232
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,420
but you could build an HTTP server or if

233
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,399
you already have an HTTP server and just

234
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,069
direct the traffic there do all your

235
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,769
processing there send it back there's no

236
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:57,860
real language requirement we just love

237
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,920
javascript and we've built this amazing

238
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,629
as a kay but we also have a bunch of

239
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,040
samples out there and all these

240
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,569
documentation specifically for

241
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:07,459
javascript so it should be very easy for

242
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,189
you guys and gals to get started today

243
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,860
so I'm not gonna bore you too much with

244
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,689
that I just want to talk a little bit

245
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:18,319
how you build one of these and like any

246
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:20,569
other piece of software it's gonna have

247
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:23,899
a user interface and a programming logic

248
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:26,839
so a front end and a back end except the

249
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,899
front end is like ear end and voice end

250
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,029
right because what you're saying what

251
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,679
you're hearing and the programming logic

252
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,800
is just gonna be some code in the

253
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,179
specific demo that I'm gonna do I'm

254
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,600
gonna build all my voice UI using

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,999
developer amazon.com and then I'm going

256
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:48,889
to close my logic in AWS quick quick

257
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,139
quick reminder what we're going to be

258
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:52,999
doing when we're building a voice UI and

259
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:53,870
I'm going to show you one that's

260
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,329
pre-made is we're gonna take uh pterence

261
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:59,540
is the different ways someone speaks and

262
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,089
then map those to an intent the intent

263
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,970
is just a flag then I then

264
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,370
look at in my code and say based on this

265
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,930
event I want to run this code but it's

266
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,610
what we're doing is we're training a

267
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,740
system we're using artificial

268
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,370
intelligence ml natural language or

269
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,370
understanding so I put a bunch of

270
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,529
utterances into a funnel and those get

271
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,920
turned into an intent and then in my

272
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,870
code I'm going to actually handle those

273
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,410
and I'll go walk line by line through

274
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,399
this code in a second but you got to

275
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,069
remember most important thing probably

276
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:42,100
out of this whole talk is garbage in

277
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,529
garbage out so you're training a model

278
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:47,949
if you put in a bunch of useless

279
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:50,050
training data it's gonna behave wildly

280
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,699
and erratically and do all these things

281
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:54,279
that you don't actually want it to do so

282
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,779
you got to be really mindful of what

283
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,879
you're training your model to do when

284
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,920
you're training the model you're not

285
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,290
building you're not creating an array or

286
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,949
an enumeration of sentences that the

287
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:08,110
user can say you're giving an array or

288
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,079
an enumeration of sentences to a machine

289
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,569
and it's going to try to build a grammar

290
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:16,540
and a language model out of that so be

291
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,829
really careful about what you what

292
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:19,720
you're doing if all your sentences end

293
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,579
in the word please what you're teaching

294
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:24,009
the model is to look for sentences that

295
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,230
end in the word please so variety

296
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,120
looking for different adjectives

297
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,059
different verbs talking in plural

298
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,259
there's a singular that one I learned

299
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,879
from my mom because she kept breaking my

300
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:39,660
skills so I'm gonna do a quick demo and

301
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,480
I'm gonna show you what I built to do

302
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,120
that really really basic skill that I

303
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,250
showed you and of course I'm logged out

304
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:57,939
and what easy fix okay so what I did is

305
00:12:57,939 --> 00:12:59,379
I created an intent that was called

306
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,500
called begin intent in a skill called

307
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,649
Cascadia Jas I actually ran into an

308
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:08,079
issue because Cascadia Jas is hard to

309
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,029
say it's a made-up word so I have to

310
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:11,769
split up into Cascadia which I didn't

311
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,139
have any issues capturing and then Jas I

312
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:16,959
did it two ways Jas has two letters and

313
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:17,360
the

314
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,149
jas as an initialism which is je period

315
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,820
s period FBI is an initialism it's not

316
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,680
really an acronym an acronym is when you

317
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,079
can say the word aloud and of course I'm

318
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,779
blanking out right now oh yeah NASA NASA

319
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,339
is a good one thank you

320
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:34,850
so in this case I did it both ways this

321
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,100
should be just but it still works and

322
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,360
what I did is I created these utterances

323
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,690
for this utterance and they're all get

324
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,180
started let's get started to start begin

325
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,320
my talk start my talk they all have this

326
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,640
they're conveying the message if I want

327
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,970
to get going and I could add a ton more

328
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,040
of a variety here what you have to be

329
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,019
mindful of is if you have multiple

330
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,970
intents you have to think of them as a

331
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,519
Venn diagram this should an overlap when

332
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,399
you're making a website or an app you

333
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,230
would never put two buttons that kind of

334
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,880
overlap and then the user clicks on it

335
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,779
you like I don't know what's gonna

336
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,980
happen exciting it's the same thing for

337
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,260
voice if you put the same utterance in

338
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,029
to intents you're gonna confuse the

339
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:21,589
model it's not gonna really know what to

340
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,690
do so it's gonna behave erratically I

341
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,269
also made a goodbye intent and a half

342
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:28,670
bye-bye goodbye say goodbye say bye in

343
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,740
there let me demo that real quick and

344
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,089
it'll just be an error because I haven't

345
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:34,160
created the code to handle it and we're

346
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,050
gonna do that right now

347
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,300
Alexa tell Cascadia jay has to say

348
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:44,029
goodbye sorry an error occurred so that

349
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:46,220
just my my back-end code saying like I

350
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,449
don't know how to handle this I got an

351
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:49,610
intent and I don't know what sorry with

352
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:56,470
it an error occurred Alexa stop goodbye

353
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,120
so it's it just it would have been just

354
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,459
cycle there with that error so what I'm

355
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,350
gonna do is go to my a Tobias console

356
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,800
and all I have here is just a lambda

357
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,339
function that has a trigger set up for

358
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,620
Alexa skills kit and has a dependency on

359
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,630
the SDK so let me show you that real

360
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,770
quick

361
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,420
[Music]

362
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:29,090
designer so this is just the AWS AWS

363
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,890
lambda console here I'm saying

364
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,170
it can take Alexa skills kit event to

365
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,060
trigger my code since it's server less

366
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,380
it doesn't mean it doesn't use a server

367
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,300
it just means that me as a lazy

368
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,740
developer I don't have to think about

369
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,090
the server I don't care if it's a

370
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,650
Windows box or a Linux box sort of

371
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,660
someone harden it or if there is a load

372
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,220
balancer in front of it it just does all

373
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,080
that magically for me which is great

374
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,190
because I don't want to spend my time

375
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,310
doing that and then looking at my code

376
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,660
really quickly you'll notice that I have

377
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,550
a few handlers they have a begin Handler

378
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,110
I have a help Handler and I have an

379
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,790
error handler and that's where we're

380
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,580
saying sorry and error occurred but I

381
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,050
don't have a handler for the other

382
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,870
intent that I created which is the let

383
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,310
me refresh this page to make sure that

384
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,700
my changes will actually do something I

385
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,200
don't have a handler for the goodbye

386
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,600
intent so it that's why just throwing an

387
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,660
error I'm gonna create that intent real

388
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,740
quickly and what we have here is I'm

389
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:36,260
just gonna steal my own code and turn

390
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,330
this begin handler into a goodbye

391
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:46,250
handler by content handler and what I'm

392
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,090
doing is this handler has two functions

393
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,770
in it when it's can't handle and the

394
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,600
other one is handle they both take a

395
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,820
handler input as a parameter and that

396
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,490
parameter contains a whole request that

397
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,990
we were sent from the Alexa service and

398
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,150
all I have to do is return true to the

399
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,370
event that I want to respond to so

400
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,709
instead I'm saying request type intent

401
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,320
request and then instead of begin intent

402
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,970
I'm going to change it to be goodbye

403
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,630
intent and I've known from doing a lot

404
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,100
of live demos that you should never type

405
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,170
copy and paste as your friend and then

406
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,480
the response here instead of being high

407
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,600
Cascadia j/s blah blah blah I'm gonna

408
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,820
just say

409
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:35,900
enjoy your lunch and then punctuation

410
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,940
spelling all those things really matter

411
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,980
here because if I screw it up it's gonna

412
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,520
say in or if I forget that my I'm

413
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,380
sending a response back that it's

414
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,120
supposed to be in Spanish and I type it

415
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,800
in English it's gonna try to parse all

416
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,750
those letters as Spanish and I'll be

417
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,210
Spanglish and it'll be hilarious but not

418
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,510
very helpful so now I'm just gonna save

419
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,490
that instance all deployed to the cloud

420
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,740
I can just immediately test it Alexa

421
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,020
tell Cascadia j/s to say goodbye sorry

422
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,870
an error occurred so this is where you

423
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,630
pull your parish an error occurs Alexa

424
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:20,420
stop and an error occurred so apparently

425
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,140
it broke everything what I'm going to do

426
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,460
is just show you from the simulator and

427
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,970
we can do a quick debug Cascadia J yes

428
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,620
so this is the simulator allows it to

429
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,120
type in things that we could also say

430
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,310
and of course nothing is working now

431
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:49,410
this is no one's fault but myself

432
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:56,289
that was a comma

433
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:00,480
okay here we go so once we see this in

434
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,130
the simulator we have the JSON object

435
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,140
that's going into my service on the left

436
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,770
and the response on the right and you'll

437
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,690
see that here's the one since I just

438
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,140
said open it's giving me that welcome

439
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,380
message but if I say open Cascadia j/s

440
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,860
and say goodbye we should get an error

441
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:27,600
that we can debug with so I have this

442
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,270
event and I can take this whole event go

443
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,730
back to my lambda function and configure

444
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,200
a test event here I'm gonna create a new

445
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,460
event gonna call it error and then I'm

446
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,429
gonna replace it there and I'm gonna

447
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:47,820
pass in this error this event into my

448
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,620
lambda function by passing the Alexa

449
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,150
service so I'm kind of spoofing it but

450
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,010
since it's my own account it's secure

451
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,840
and I can actually do that then I'm

452
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,510
gonna click test and I think I already

453
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,970
know my error which is my error that I

454
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,669
always make which is handler chain on

455
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,740
found yep

456
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,110
handler chain on phone so what I did is

457
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,640
I created the handler but I never

458
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,380
registered it so it doesn't know there's

459
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:17,830
a handler for it so I'm going to

460
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,090
register that handler this is what

461
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,330
happens in your live code copy that

462
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,250
handler and then down here at the bottom

463
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,669
with the actual SDK I just register that

464
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:33,480
I'm gonna save and test and now we

465
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,580
should just see that enjoy your lunch

466
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,280
message so it works I'm gonna wait wait

467
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,600
a second for Alexa to come back because

468
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,950
I unplugged her because he was looped

469
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,220
and we'll test that in the meantime now

470
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,480
that we've done with our demo and got

471
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,610
four minutes I just wanted to leave you

472
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,090
with some design notes about voice so a

473
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,950
few thoughts on design the first one is

474
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,049
friction is the enemy any time I'm doing

475
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:57,240
anything with voice I'm probably like

476
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,190
that awesome lady just hanging out on a

477
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,970
hammock by a cactus reading a book

478
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,470
but uh but what I don't want to do is

479
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,110
get up and touch something or find my

480
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,060
phone or whatever like I just want to be

481
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,220
able to say thing so if it doesn't pass

482
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,920
the couch test it's not good it's not

483
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,740
probably a good use case for a voice we

484
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,350
also don't talk the way we write just

485
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,870
ask your English teacher from twelfth

486
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,950
grade so anytime you type in something

487
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,690
that the user needs to say or that

488
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,820
Alexa's gonna reply just say it out loud

489
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,500
you'll be surprised at how good we're at

490
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,150
tongue twisters but you read them and

491
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,170
they're like that makes perfect sense

492
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,790
I'm an incredible writer where's my

493
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,130
where's my Oscar

494
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,750
the other one is follow the brought the

495
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,840
one breath rule if you're sending some

496
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,620
response back and it takes longer than a

497
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,420
breath to read out it's too much

498
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,640
information voice has a problem or a

499
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,990
it's not a problem it just a

500
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,120
characteristic which is it required it

501
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,340
has a high cognitive load and what that

502
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,200
means is we have to pay attention to

503
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,180
what the device is saying we can't

504
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,010
multitask with voice you couldn't

505
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,600
pretend that you're watching a movie and

506
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,430
also listening to a conversation but you

507
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,870
quickly context with Jing and you're

508
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,360
probably getting 70% of one and thirty

509
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,010
percent of the other so if we're giving

510
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,270
the user options and they're only

511
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,670
getting 30% of it it's gonna be bad so

512
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,360
be brief and don't talk at people talk

513
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,220
to people you know we want to model

514
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,800
something as a real conversation between

515
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,610
humans variety is your friend so every

516
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,440
time you call your bank or your airline

517
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,150
you get the exact same prompts in the

518
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,370
exact same monotone voice that is

519
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,070
incredibly boring that's also not how we

520
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,560
talk with humans so after have some

521
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,170
spice in there use SS ml say YUM when

522
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,660
you're ending your message it makes it

523
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,850
stickier it makes it memorable if it's

524
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,940
Monday say happy Monday or if it's

525
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,160
Thursday say it's almost Friday I don't

526
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,450
know just make it a little bit more

527
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,370
interesting designed for the situation

528
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,740
you can break down any step in a

529
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,960
conversation into four things the

530
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,030
utterance so what the user said what the

531
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,980
situation they're in is the first time

532
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,810
I've ever seen them is there's a 100th

533
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,670
time they saw I saw them where they in

534
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,990
the middle of the game last time they

535
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,240
talked to me and then what response on

536
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,220
them I'm gonna send them and what prompt

537
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,020
or what question am I gonna ask them you

538
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,090
can break down every single interaction

539
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,010
to this and then you can make awesome

540
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,220
little cards with those and start

541
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,330
storyboarding with them diagrams or

542
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,039
flowcharts are not a good way to design

543
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,659
a voice conversation because the user

544
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:31,179
can say anything whenever they want if I

545
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:33,130
call a travel agent I can and they ask

546
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,230
me where do you want to go I can say I

547
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,610
want to go tomorrow and they're not

548
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,929
gonna hang up on me and be like nope

549
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:40,710
wrong answer

550
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,150
so your skills should work the same way

551
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,450
it should be really really freeing again

552
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,750
friction is the enemy that is it for me

553
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,299
I just want to let Alexis say goodbye

554
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:57,470
Alexa tell Cascadia Jas to say goodbye

555
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,140
sorry I'm not sure that fun thank you so

556
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,770
much it was an absolute pleasure

557
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:11,030
[Applause]

558
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,550
all right bear with us for just one or

559
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,520
two minutes while we do little laptops

560
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,070
which I know oh by the way while I have

561
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,600
your attention for a couple a couple

562
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,210
moments I'll just go ahead and admit

563
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,510
that I can ask more specific and better

564
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,850
questions when trying to plan lunches

565
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,400
that is a betterment that we can do for

566
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,160
next year I would I do want to say

567
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,440
though if you did not specifically

568
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,900
specify a dietary restriction of

569
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,220
vegetarian or vegan please abstain from

570
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,080
those items when you go grab lunch I

571
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,540
know they're all delicious but planning

572
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,160
is tough and we just want to make sure

573
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,960
that there are enough vegetarian and

574
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,220
vegan options for the people who need

575
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,240
them but here we are and I wanted to

576
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,460
take a couple minutes to talk about the

577
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,170
closing party that we're having tonight

578
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,440

579
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,640
