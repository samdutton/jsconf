know this already when I'm not doing

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,890
that I'm a developer from Berlin and I

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,300
work on a JavaScript library called

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,460
hoodie a database called couchdb and I

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,770
also did mustache jas but i'm no longer

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,950
maintaining that first and foremost i

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,020
have to express how honored I am to

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,649
speak here at jazz conf last call and

13
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,850
Jess confessed changed my life

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,660
significantly for the better so thank

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,990
you for having me you all know that this

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,850
is the last jazz come that the family

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,080
Williams was going to do for the

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,000
foreseeable future and while there are a

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,160
lot of reasons to be sad about this for

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,810
the next 20 or so minutes I like to

21
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,120
focus on the happy parts selfishly i'll

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,510
start with my own story the years 2008

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,130
and we're just all getting used to

24
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,660
iphones and having our digital lives

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,030
with us at all times I'm instant

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,500
messaging buddies with Chris because

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,780
that's what you did before Twitter even

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,070
though Twitter was around it wasn't as

29
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,749
they get so um being instant messaging

30
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:14,039
bodies with someone from the east coast

31
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,810
coming from Europe means that lots of

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,670
late-night chats for me because I'm six

33
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:27,780
hours ahead oh I wouldn't one night

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,939
chris is just back from Ruby fringe a

35
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,700
ruby conference put on by Pete Ford in

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,490
toronto canada and chris mentions two

37
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,530
things number one he's been to a lot of

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,420
industry conferences but now that he's

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,340
seen a ruby french how it can be done

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,590
right he concludes that a lot of

41
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,659
conferences are not very good and if you

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,009
know Chris you know he phrased it

43
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,149
slightly differently nevertheless I

44
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,549
agree second he asks what do you think

45
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,740
about a JavaScript conference and I

46
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,959
consider for a moment well they are

47
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,639
probably a lot of JavaScript developers

48
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,799
and that doesn't seem to be a conference

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,069
so maybe that's a good idea so I say it

50
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:07,649
is and he said I'm glad you say this

51
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,400
because I'm organizing one fast forward

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,140
a few months it's three a.m. in berlin

53
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,170
and we're chatting as you do insert the

54
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,990
noise and chris says the tickets are not

55
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,740
setting very well

56
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,070
they might have to cancel and I'm trying

57
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,710
to encourage a friend and it's also 3am

58
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,740
so in Sleepy Hayes I say if Jays gone

59
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,470
visit success i'll take it to europe

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,840
fateful day couple of weeks later it's

61
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,910
time to tell the venue that they had

62
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,010
booked that they vent us off that the

63
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,780
Williamsons need williams's need the

64
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,490
deposit back as it turns out they had

65
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,140
back there more headed back by the

66
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,760
mortgage and they don't wanna lose the

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,610
house and because Chris doesn't quite

68
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,230
know how to phrase the this was a

69
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,270
failure message and because he doesn't

70
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,130
want more people to sign up he quickly

71
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,320
changes the website to sold-out calls

72
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,970
his ticket sales and drives to the venue

73
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,000
the drive is about 45 minutes nearly

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,920
there he checks his email again remember

75
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,340
the iphone is just new and whose other

76
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,140
and complete surprise there's an email

77
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,480
that asks about how to maybe get one

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,630
more ticket pretty please and another

79
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,600
email and another and until there enough

80
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,400
inquiries to put jay is coming over the

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,350
break even point if all of the inquiries

82
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,570
buy one ticket so instead of canceling

83
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,460
the event and getting the deposit back

84
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,800
the willing zooms confirmed us conf on

85
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,560
the spot and the event is on that's good

86
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,550
good origin story there so the days here

87
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,650
and we all gather in a hotel ballroom in

88
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,580
Washington DC during my work on CouchDB

89
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,590
and I get to talk to all the different

90
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,510
language communities as being the

91
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,010
database person kind of a privilege to

92
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,150
like learn from all the different

93
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,130
communities so I'm seeing a lot of

94
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,260
familiar faces there are a lot of Ruby

95
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,330
developers who do javascript on the side

96
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,610
there are a lot of Python developers who

97
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,440
do javascript on the side and there a

98
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,120
lot of PHP developers who do javascript

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,470
on this side and a lot more other

100
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,300
developers who do javascript on the side

101
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,630
and after lunch and listening to half a

102
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,400
day worth of just JavaScript talks the

103
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,320
mood in the ballroom like nearly

104
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,630
physically changes you can see the mood

105
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,970
changing and we're starting to realize

106
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,180
slowly that we are JavaScript people who

107
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,310
do Ruby on the site and Python on the

108
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,200
side and PHP on the side but primarily

109
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,060
we are JavaScript people and the first

110
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,620
Jess confess since been described as a

111
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,479
homecoming of a community that didn't

112
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:33,639
know

113
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,889
it existed and that's exactly what

114
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,449
happened we now had a JavaScript

115
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,499
community there wasn't one before so at

116
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:43,360
the end of day two when Laura and Chris

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,759
do the closing remarks Tris asks me to

118
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,979
stand up I get up completely oblivious

119
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:53,499
to what was about to happen so he

120
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:55,240
thanked me for supporting him through

121
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,669
tough times and he also said that one of

122
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,159
the things that I had said to support

123
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:01,689
him was that if Jasmine was a success

124
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:07,870
i'll take it to europe and he continued

125
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,939
addressing the audience you will have to

126
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:12,039
decide whether this was a success but if

127
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,169
you think it was let you know because

128
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,759
then he'll take it to europe and of

129
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,319
course thunderous applause when i go out

130
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:24,159
haha yeah fateful day indeed luckily I

131
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:28,960
admit malta and hoga at the at the bar

132
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,569
previous the previous night so that was

133
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,189
where the original curators came

134
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,589
together how that was formed we have

135
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:36,939
since been joined by Tiffany Connor and

136
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,710
Carolina sure who have been fantastic

137
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,719
additions to the team we had a good good

138
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:43,300
fun running a bunch of events um a

139
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,520
couple of months later we run jazz

140
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,800
confit you in Berlin still in 2009 and

141
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,479
of course or first because John Resig

142
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:58,750
because that's what you do and also ryan

143
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,370
doyle introduces no jazz for the first

144
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,319
time he uses my laptop for this i'm very

145
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,479
proud of this also just just mike my

146
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,889
conference is also good enough so that

147
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:08,229
started the whole know jazz thing which

148
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,599
is really really cool and two chaps from

149
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,949
Ireland Paul and Eamon they they attend

150
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:16,659
and they think well if our friends can

151
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:19,449
put on a conference we can do it too so

152
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,189
they went on to do the legendary funk on

153
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,740
series of events where things like these

154
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,599
are just to count totally normal if you

155
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,189
can't see in the background that's a

156
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,990
DeLorean there's donkey there's a clown

157
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,639
juggling and lots of other shenanigans

158
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,800
going happen to happening this is also

159
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,389
completely normal this is just the

160
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,000
engine yard team photo that you do and

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,750
and fun converse planned as a trilogy so

162
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,849
that is over now but Paul still runs the

163
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:45,279
conference called all which is also

164
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,409
inspired by jazz confident way

165
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:50,289
and Paul also went on to build Tito the

166
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:51,909
world's favorite conference ticketing

167
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,409
system so if you ever put on a

168
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,689
conference use Tito everybody will love

169
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:57,489
you for it I'm not getting paid for this

170
00:06:57,489 --> 00:07:04,239
I may get paid for this a few years

171
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,919
later one of the organizers of the front

172
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,469
trans conference and also speaks in

173
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,330
Poland of course pics at Berlin JS our

174
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,489
local javascript meetup that we put up

175
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:14,499
every month after we started Jas conf

176
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,719
which kind of was the inspiration for

177
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:19,119
the whole bar ojs story that jet told

178
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,289
yesterday we but forgot to

179
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:26,439
mention but don't worry about it no he

180
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,909
said so many nice things about our event

181
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:29,739
so I may actually not there's no grudge

182
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:33,669
here afterwards we talked and he said

183
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,409
well he went to Jess come for you and

184
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,399
the friends to you and they wanted

185
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,139
something like this at home and I

186
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,219
started looking for people who could

187
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:40,300
they could ask they could you run this

188
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,399
event for us they couldn't find any so

189
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,110
they decided to do it on their own and

190
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,869
they're not alone these are just very

191
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:49,899
few of the conference would have spawned

192
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:53,619
from jas kana and have been inspired by

193
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:55,300
Jess conf and the one thing that brings

194
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,879
all of these events together is the deep

195
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,800
care about the community communities

196
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,050
that they are organized for about caring

197
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,029
for people trying new things not

198
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:05,349
following the same old patterns or

199
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,499
running soulless events just for profit

200
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,759
putting people first attendees and

201
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,550
speakers everyone and that focus comes

202
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,469
from laura's and Chris's dedication and

203
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:16,139
craftiness to put on an event that

204
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,449
facilitates a community coming together

205
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:22,179
over and over again while writing this

206
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:24,189
talk had dawned on me that feeling that

207
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:26,559
we had at that very first jazz conf in

208
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,329
Washington DC when we realized what we

209
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,399
didn't know before that we were the

210
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,490
JavaScript community every event since

211
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,579
that jazz conf in 2009 in this lineage

212
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:37,930
is an attempt to recreate that feeling

213
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,539
of newfound companionship and to allow

214
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,629
an ever growing group of people to

215
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:45,069
experience the community for the first

216
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:48,279
time and feel at home front trends has

217
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,259
now been running for five years has had

218
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:52,600
over 2,200 ten days jazz confused on

219
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,149
seven editions and lockstep with us and

220
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,040
has had over twenty five hundred

221
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,100
thousand 2500 2 10 G's

222
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,520
4010 is that's way too many now the

223
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,650
kicker the there are over 50 events

224
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,450
including a JS conf run every inhabited

225
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,760
continents and sometimes more than one

226
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,070
and way more than one and they all have

227
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,990
a similar story than the one above its

228
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,360
they're great this is great I want to do

229
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,490
this I want to have this at home or this

230
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,720
was great I want to do this with a

231
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,730
different context where the whole series

232
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,500
of CSS comes that's now spreading over

233
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,620
the world's coming from this and over 50

234
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,360
events with well over fifty thousand

235
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,530
attendees over the past seven years

236
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,840
alone have come out of Loris and chris's

237
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,030
commitment to this community and that's

238
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,890
just the in-person events our joint

239
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,600
video collection on YouTube has received

240
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,900
nearly 2.5 million views and over 50

241
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,330
million minutes of viewing time that's

242
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,950
an achievement that we as a community

243
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,800
can be very proud of but that we have to

244
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,170
be that dub sorry I'm very proud and

245
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,330
that we have to be thankful for for

246
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,710
Chris and Laura that they did that for

247
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,810
us so I talked to a bunch of the people

248
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,930
behind those logos what motivates them

249
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,370
first ones Robin mania he runs reject

250
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,950
chest which destiny was called reject

251
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,260
Jess for people who got their talk

252
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,890
rejected from jay s con and people

253
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,510
initially thought they were like RJ's

254
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,310
compass evil but behind the scenes we

255
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,750
all work together so that was quite fun

256
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,040
and so and reject itself then has

257
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,920
inspired other conferences that like

258
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,290
this alright so this is you see that's a

259
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,830
lot of lot of forking going on and so

260
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,450
Robin says we wanted to give more people

261
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,740
the chance to become part of the

262
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,920
JavaScript community Tiago Rodriguez who

263
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,860
runs alex j s in lisbon portugal says we

264
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,360
wanted to bring something similar to

265
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,040
jazz comfort approach ago and there was

266
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,290
no JavaScript commune in Portugal so I

267
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,920
had to go into it through Quilly who

268
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,570
runs web rebels in Oslo know for the

269
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,150
fourth year says we felt the Jays

270
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,710
confetti community feeling that no other

271
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,820
conference around us had and finally

272
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,960
douglass campus who runs jazz from

273
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,300
brazil says hey I got blasted away with

274
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,680
the awesomeness of the experience I

275
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,110
wanted to bring this home they have all

276
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,690
the say like they have the same

277
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,610
motivation they wanna they see their

278
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,840
something special now I want to bring

279
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,810
this to that particular community so

280
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,880
let's see what they got out of what they

281
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,030
achieved

282
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,010
brault organized of and yet conf

283
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,650
real-time con frio Trigon because when

284
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,330
why not run conferences like for

285
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,460
conference at the same time and says we

286
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,110
created an entirely new community so he

287
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,940
took the idea of jazz convent of the

288
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,770
cultural spirit behind and applied to

289
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,720
different scenarios and like we did in

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,700
2009 created an entirely new community

291
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,990
where people coming together around an

292
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,290
idea how great is that fantastic Thiago

293
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,880
says it spawned and brought together the

294
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,130
JavaScript community in Portugal it made

295
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,840
more people get involved start doing

296
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,310
more JavaScript work for noon and

297
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,620
international companies nowadays as a

298
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,210
regular meet up in Lisbon and a number

299
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,310
of note schools around the country

300
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,670
awesome Tiffany Conroy fellow organizer

301
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,310
of jazz confused as we made a visible

302
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,350
presence of women and under up and other

303
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,000
underrepresented groups and expected

304
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
part of a well-run tech conference and

305
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,110
I'm very proud of that to this industry

306
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,630
looked a lot different seven years ago

307
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,550
and we have made a significant

308
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,320
improvement to that there's still a lot

309
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:16,970
of work but we're on the way and at

310
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,170
and at this point I have to apologize

311
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,120
for the poor representation of women in

312
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,339
my list of quotes the reasons for these

313
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:24,899
are beyond the scope of the stock but if

314
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,930
you're interested chat to me later p

315
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,170
tight conjunto JS and edinburgh says we

316
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,430
now have a JavaScript community in

317
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,260
Scotland with both meetups both in

318
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,000
Glasgow and Edinburgh that didn't exist

319
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,310
before and he continues over the years

320
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,019
we have been able to give a platform to

321
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,880
newbie speakers that have gone on to

322
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,279
become amazing at sharing the knowledge

323
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,370
in case in point and who's seen Phillip

324
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,990
Roberts's talk what is the event loop

325
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,230
anyway alright there's a few people in

326
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,459
this room that are going to have their

327
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,899
minds blown when they watch this talk

328
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,079
but and so he gave a similar target

329
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,300
Scotland jazz in spring 2014 and we

330
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,949
liked it so much we invited him to give

331
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,589
a revised and updated version and two in

332
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:08,850
September of the same year and the talk

333
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,019
has gotten is very popular like nearly a

334
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,940
hundred thousand people watch this this

335
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,649
is a blockbuster for tech talk on

336
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,350
youtube like this is a big deal and it's

337
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,389
it shot straight into the top three

338
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:24,959
talks of all Jas comms ever and this is

339
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,610
from a conference that ran for the first

340
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,279
time inspired by Jess conf in a local

341
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,829
event and in the local area and found

342
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:33,360
someone that we could bring back to the

343
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,060
community and that now like does what

344
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,610
Pete s like become amazing a chair in

345
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,560
the knowledge and this just shows how

346
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,779
how well this community thing works and

347
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,089
how well they this stories is

348
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:47,579
helping us that we can bring ideas and

349
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,319
cultures to a lot of like places in the

350
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,839
world and they come back things come

351
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,519
back to us through the same channels and

352
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,839
I'm just very proud of this and Robin

353
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,730
who else around sorry i'll skip to the

354
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,470
second so Robin also runs the node

355
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,180
copter series of events which if you're

356
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,459
here you've definitely seen and he

357
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,680
relates an anecdote that when I asked

358
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,389
them to open up a txt file they opened

359
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,790
it up in Microsoft Word but at the end

360
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,139
of the day they were had they had a

361
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,940
flying or the program to flying robot

362
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,920
that acted like a jellyfish complete

363
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,899
with flying patterns and everything so

364
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,470
this community does cool stuff and does

365
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,339
it allows a lot more people to come in

366
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,590
and teaches them

367
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,810
and click for says there was no

368
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,430
community before there was a huge java

369
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,410
community in Oslo and I think we have

370
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,000
disrupted that I think that's very good

371
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,970
and then Thomas Carson who is over there

372
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,950
who runs Jess fascia and Singapore and

373
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,700
other places he also relates a story

374
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,770
about the working conditions of IT

375
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,690
professionals in Asia and sweat shop is

376
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,860
a word that I've heard many times

377
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,930
salaries are low and work is grinding

378
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,180
and uninspiring I do believe our little

379
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,860
and growing community makes a difference

380
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,270
how awesome is that fix Asia good job

381
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,650
and so I couldn't just like say all the

382
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,180
things that are great about this without

383
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,800
also mentioning that it is a lot of work

384
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,800
and Tiago has the perfect template for

385
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,930
the series of responses i'll i'll show

386
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,900
you now it was a lot of work but i met a

387
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,330
lot of other great people the pattern is

388
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,760
it was a lot of work was the hardest

389
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,660
thing I've ever done whatever peril but

390
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,710
some gratification so neck whose real

391
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,240
name I'm not trying to pronounce who

392
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,460
runs jazz combo depressed and hungry

393
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,860
says one of the most stressful and

394
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,870
exhaustive things I've ever done but

395
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,910
seeing the enthusiasm of our attendees

396
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,590
and making friends and helping others

397
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,890
totally worth it Carter obey sir who

398
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,530
runs the Cascadia Jas and then Cascadia

399
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,090
fest in the Pacific Northwest in the

400
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,100
canada and the US says the hours are

401
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,930
long and the rewards can seem fleeting

402
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,460
but over the last four years I've met

403
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,750
some of the brightest kindness and

404
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,870
hardest-working people I've ever known

405
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,610
so if it's that much work why do they do

406
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,530
this encounter continues to me JS conf

407
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,110
is the conference that taught me that

408
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,600
being a better programmer starts with

409
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,190
being a better person Robin em who kind

410
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,260
of has a tendency for taking things over

411
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,430
the top and he got married in 2014 and

412
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:35,229
then came here with his lovely wife

413
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:38,939
and through continuous we had we have

414
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:40,350
picked up excellent skills and emailing

415
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,879
spreadsheet management and dealing with

416
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,069
the constant guilt of being behind tasks

417
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,639
behind on tasks you love you never

418
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,059
organized a conference this is the non

419
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,149
funny part abso Pete and Pete from

420
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:56,809
Scotland sums it up perfectly though

421
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,980
running a conference is an awesome

422
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,679
exciting stressful and incredibly

423
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,649
rewarding experience and it has been

424
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,380
that for crew Laura and Chris since 2009

425
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,860
and for every year since and they didn't

426
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,029
do this for the first time in history

427
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:13,679
but for the first time for this

428
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,049
community and they kept added and we owe

429
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:18,659
them so much for the hard work and

430
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:21,329
persistence and everything else that

431
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:23,490
they brought into making Jess conf what

432
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,079
is today an inspiration for a generation

433
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:35,600
Thank You Laura and Chris
