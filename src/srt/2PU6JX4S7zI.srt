00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:20,920

you

2
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,140
Jacob is my name and I'm a developer at

3
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,000
heart definitely but I'm also an

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,800
entrepreneur I've started a couple of

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,420
companies worked at a couple of startups

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,599
and so on and I'm generally like a crazy

7
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,520
person because I don't think anyone

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,730
saying would actually keep doing that

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,010
so what I'm into anyway is only startups

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,059
and lean and agile and XP and TDD and

11
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:46,340
pair programming and all those things

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,620
you know it and you get kind of

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,900
desperate at times when you want to work

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,710
24/7 24/7 and there's no one else around

15
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,050
so you start to pair up with whoever's

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,910
whoever's there and I've been doing like

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,730
different types of work I used to work

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,500
at the big data company in Sweden called

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,440
Burt which deals with a lot of data for

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,930
being a start-up and then I went on to

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,780
do kind of a small data start-up where

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,200
we dealt with very little data instead

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,380
I've also done some consulting with a

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,750
couple of friends for for other startups

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,950
and for VCS and so on and currently I'm

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,010
working at a company called fish brain

27
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,250
which helps sports fishers to catch more

28
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,200
and bigger fish so you guys look at and

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
I'm from I'm from Sweden and by the way

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,870
how many people in here have have been

31
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,480
to Sweden like very few like three or so

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,910
so I guess all of you kind of have an

33
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,850
idea of Sweden and I bet it's a lot like

34
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,980
this

35
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,880
like everyone thinks we're all like

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,850
butch men wearing heavy furs and always

37
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,290
talking about the fact that winter is

38
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,979
coming but it's it's not like that it's

39
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,960
worse it's more like this so yeah

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,540
miserable and what do Swedes do then

41
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,330
well we we stay inside we code that's

42
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,550
that's something we can do to stay away

43
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,720
from the cold and and some people they

44
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,430
they do something else that that's

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,110
actually also kind of a passion of mine

46
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,290
which is music and in the city where I'm

47
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,780
from which is called Gothenburg and it's

48
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,590
on the west coast of Sweden we actually

49
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,170
pioneered a specific genre of music

50
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,180
called melodic death metal very Swedish

51
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,880
like we have to get this rage of this

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,600
cold out out somehow so as you can see

53
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,790
melodic death metal is like an extreme

54
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,450
sub-genre of heavy metal music and it's

55
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,430
centered around our city so I thought

56
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,380
before I start I just share some of my

57
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,870
culture with you guys so this is how

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:25,729
Swedish people get the rage out

59
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,760
yeah so if anyone actually knew what

60
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,129
song that was or what band please tweet

61
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,840
it to me and I will be very warm and

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,420
fuzzy inside

63
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,099
right okay okay um I'm not here to talk

64
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,099
about sweets or metal or snow and or

65
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,959
anything like that I'm here to talk

66
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,840
about CSS testing and how it's not just

67
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,360
a myth so the purpose of this

68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,810
presentation is is not to show off tons

69
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,069
of code and and like show exactly what

70
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:02,739
I'm doing in particular but rather raise

71
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,720
the awareness of the tools that are out

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
there because there are actually quite a

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,000
few and also I want to give you some

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,110
inspiration to a new workflow which

75
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,109
could help you with these things but

76
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:19,720
before we dive into that I just want to

77
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,250
say something about declarative

78
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,430
programming which I'm sure most of you

79
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,979
know exactly what it is but just to make

80
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,490
sure everyone's on the same level and

81
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,110
this is one definition of it and

82
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,000
declarative programming is a programming

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,240
paradigm that expresses the logic of a

84
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,220
computation without describing the

85
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,940
control flow like functional very

86
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,450
functional programming and and how does

87
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,970
that apply to us as web developers

88
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,610
because I mean this is our domain and

89
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,120
this is what we do well obviously the

90
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,240
like core languages for the web HTML and

91
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,270
CSS are highly declarative you can't

92
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,250
control how a computation is that is

93
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,000
done you can only describe what you want

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,710
to achieve and then the browser will

95
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,770
take care of it all of it and that's

96
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,530
kind of cool right because then we can't

97
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,740
really screw things up it's made to be

98
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,120
exactly what you type in and you're

99
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,950
gonna get that thing and everyone's

100
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,610
happy right but that's not really the

101
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,800
case because as developers we keep

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,860
yelling more more all the time we want

103
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,500
better tools we want more advanced ways

104
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,080
of doing things we want to manipulate

105
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,260
manipulate everything so

106
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,370
when it comes to CSS people have of

107
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,930
course created solutions for that like

108
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,460
pre-processors like sass and less and

109
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,370
stylist and so on and we add all things

110
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,710
like variables and mix-ins and all kinds

111
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,590
of reuse and operations and everything

112
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,230
to make this language more powerful to

113
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,130
make it do exactly what we want but the

114
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,820
question I want to ask is are we like

115
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,120
really really making it easier to work

116
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,880
with CSS with these things or are we

117
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,640
just adding more complicated levels of

118
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,290
abstraction on top of what we already

119
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,370
have because I kind of feel like CSS is

120
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,970
a lot about writing and even these

121
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,230
pre-processors it's a lot about writing

122
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,170
like oh how can I I skip these extra

123
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,140
characters and how can I reuse this

124
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,520
function so I don't have to type it

125
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,190
again and so on but we're never really

126
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,910
talking about reading sure I mean it's

127
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,340
easier to read code that is shorter but

128
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,000
that's not really the whole picture so

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,160
when I look at a code base with a lot of

130
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,320
CSS like not something you've just been

131
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,030
working on for a month but something

132
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,430
that is a huge project that has lived

133
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,730
for a while I usually always see the

134
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,950
same thing when I like stare through the

135
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,340
code and and that's something like this

136
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,140
like a couple of developers writing away

137
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,140
into the sunset shooting their guns like

138
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,410
there's no real process there's no no

139
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,120
tools to make sure that you have high

140
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,190
quality in your CSS and there are a

141
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,100
number of like total anti patterns being

142
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,420
used when it comes to CSS it's it's a

143
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,000
whole lot easier to just add a new style

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,980
instead of reusing what's already there

145
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,800
because it's hard to find what you're

146
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,410
looking for you have thousands of lines

147
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,140
and you don't know exactly what classes

148
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,420
are intended to do the exact same thing

149
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,400
you want to do and even if you find one

150
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,340
that has the same attributes that you

151
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,480
want to apply on your Dom element you

152
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,490
cannot be sure that someone else wasn't

153
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,640
thinking about maybe adding something to

154
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,920
that later or so on so it's just a lot

155
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,170
easier to just add a new class and and

156
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,750
throw that thing onto your your own

157
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,820
elements and just as bad or maybe worse

158
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,910
unused Styles are like rarely removed

159
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,570
because there's like almost no reason

160
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,370
you don't know what pages the style

161
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,680
might be might be used on maybe maybe

162
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,000
the class names are generated

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,210
dynamically or and you don't really

164
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,650
break anything if you keep them there

165
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,100
they just live on and become like dead

166
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,680
code which you don't really know if it's

167
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,490
dead or not and you have no overview as

168
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,910
to how the different styles interact

169
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,590
it's just a flat structure at least

170
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,290
plain CSS is and you have to read all

171
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,760
through all of it in order to understand

172
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,510
all the ideas and then of course we have

173
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,400
all these things like form factors and

174
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,380
adaptiveness and responsiveness and

175
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,330
these things that makes things even

176
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,080
harder so if you test it in one browser

177
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,940
and you see that yeah well it's okay if

178
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,680
I remove this class I don't need it then

179
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,900
well what happens in all other

180
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,450
situations and all other devices and so

181
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,380
on so in my opinion CSS is like the the

182
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,440
true right only language we say that

183
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,690
about languages like Perl or whatever

184
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,540
but but CSS is like truly right only you

185
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,360
you can actually get away by just adding

186
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,700
new styles with stronger selectors and

187
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,730
just putting more into your code

188
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,900
base and I looked at Wikipedia like what

189
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,360
are they saying about the the concept of

190
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,360
write only languages and it says this in

191
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,530
computer humor computer humor a write

192
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,600
only language is a programming language

193
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,060
with syntax or semantics sufficiently

194
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,910
dense and bizarre that any routine of

195
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,160
significant size is too difficult to

196
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,260
understand by other programmers and

197
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,200
cannot safely be edited

198
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,580
this is computer humor this is the life

199
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,890
for a living this is not humor this is

200
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,890
for real this is exactly what CSS feels

201
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,680
like and if you feel differently please

202
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,420
tell me because then you know something

203
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,890
that I don't so code quality something

204
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,740
we all struggle with right and when we

205
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,200
talk about this if we let go of CSS for

206
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,570
a while like what do we mean when we

207
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,750
talk about code quality well obviously

208
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,760
kind of the opposite of what I was

209
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,190
already saying but in general we have

210
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,760
this functional quality like the thing

211
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,250
we have created this is fit for it's fit

212
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,500
to do what we intended to do we solve

213
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,360
the problem and the second type of

214
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,910
quality is structural quality the degree

215
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,640
to to which we have created this in a in

216
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,320
a structured way in a good way and

217
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,570
that's kind of the problem with CSS

218
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,370
because we can do we can achieve the

219
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,010
things we want to but the the way to get

220
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,760
there is kind of stupid and structural

221
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,740
quality can be broken down into like

222
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,860
reliability maintainability size

223
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,050
efficiency security and so on and many

224
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,790
of these doesn't really apply for CSS

225
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,190
size is not that much of a concern

226
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,550
honestly and efficiency well we don't

227
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,220
control that even but the reliability of

228
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,350
the code and the maintainability of it

229
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,130
how how do we control that in other

230
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,710
programming languages what should we

231
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,840
start applying in in CSS and the answer

232
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,090
is of course rather obvious because you

233
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,440
already know what I'm about to talk

234
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,860
about

235
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,240
so tests of course we need tests that's

236
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,430
what you do that's what you do to

237
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,340
maintain high quality and make code

238
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,580
understandable for other developers how

239
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,560
many in here do actually write tests for

240
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,860
your code and I mean any code not CSS

241
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,650
but code scaring leaf you then a lot of

242
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,310
you actually you have a have a lot ahead

243
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,660
of you but to me testing is is like the

244
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,269
only way to to start feeling like

245
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:12,119
about your program like you get the

246
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,679
feeling that you can change anything

247
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,740
move anything try anything just be like

248
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,069
the master of your codebase without

249
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,550
losing your mind and for those of you

250
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,819
who are not that into two tests then I

251
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:30,420
just want to want to look at the typical

252
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,709
like test-driven development flow so the

253
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:38,610
idea is that you write the test that

254
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,249
fails you can do it first you can do it

255
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:43,350
after you've written your code but the

256
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,600
if you're really test driven then you do

257
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,790
it first so you write the test to

258
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,379
describe something that you want to

259
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,779
achieve you haven't done it yet but

260
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,249
you're describing what you want to do

261
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:55,350
what you want to achieve and then when

262
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,879
you have that then you start

263
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,829
implementing code that will make this

264
00:12:58,829 --> 00:12:59,279
thing work

265
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,819
and when it works then you can go back

266
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,639
and start eliminating redundancy like

267
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,339
optimize your code remove pieces that

268
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,029
are not needed share reuse parts of that

269
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,670
with other parts of your code and so on

270
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,069
and be certain that everything still

271
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:21,230
works so what about testing CSS then

272
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,429
because obviously we could start

273
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:25,350
thinking the same way about CSS but

274
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,619
there is one big problem and that's

275
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:30,959
coming back to this declarative thing

276
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,910
that CSS is not procedural you can't

277
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,189
jack into CSS and change the way it

278
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:41,189
works or test for some some particular

279
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:43,980
part of it you can only go directly from

280
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,139
the code that you have written to an

281
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,540
actual this visual result the browser

282
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,089
does magic in between and it's not yours

283
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:57,240
to touch but let's try anyway let's do

284
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,619
something because that's what's

285
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:02,549
interesting right so I'm gonna walk

286
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:05,490
through four different approaches quite

287
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,819
quickly hopefully and then try to try to

288
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:10,860
summarize what we can learn from from

289
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,860
looking at those and and two of them are

290
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,679
quite simple they're targeted at your

291
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,399
code and two of them are more advanced

292
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,329
aiming at

293
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:23,429
stting the actual visuals that you're

294
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:29,999
producing with your CSS code so first

295
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:33,059
one this is like super simple people

296
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:36,299
don't even think of it as a test and

297
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:39,329
it's it's the syntax checks that you can

298
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:42,329
do in your your editor hopefully like

299
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:45,059
you check whether or not the CSS you

300
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,189
have written is is actually valid is

301
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:50,040
this something that works and it's

302
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,470
typically done by a plug-in or an IDE or

303
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,279
person and obviously it just looks

304
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,360
something like this we have some

305
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,639
highlighting and something tells us

306
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,410
what's going on all of you are probably

307
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,489
already doing this and then the second

308
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,279
way to to check your code statically to

309
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,360
see what's going on is to use some type

310
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,959
of style guides and in combination with

311
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,189
linting so we we specify how we want our

312
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:23,999
CSS to be written like both since I

313
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:26,939
quickly like where should braces be how

314
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,220
how much should we indent our code and

315
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,739
and so on which is kind of trivial but

316
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:36,629
also semantically like what kinds of of

317
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:39,269
attributes should you not use together

318
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,489
or should you not combine in certain

319
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:44,249
ways to catch like common mistakes or

320
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:46,350
patterns that won't work in IE or

321
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,040
whatever and there are there are tools

322
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,470
for this for example this one called CSS

323
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,259
lint it's a lot like javascript linter

324
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,449
but it's for CSS and you can run it on

325
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,639
the web or you can download it and run

326
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,199
it on the command line I think it's a

327
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,509
node.js it's a node.js

328
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,559
implementation and you can specify your

329
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,899
own style guides or or use ones that

330
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:15,149
come with it as suggestions so the

331
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:18,389
reason why this is is good and I think

332
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:20,100
you should start using is that it's

333
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,619
totally easy to apply your totally I

334
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,869
guess you're already doing some kind of

335
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:26,910
static checking of your code like you're

336
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,350
compiling CoffeeScript or you're

337
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,439
compiling less and you're doing you're

338
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,149
doing anything on your JavaScript and

339
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,710
whatever you can just add this

340
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,410
into this and it prevents common and

341
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,500
anti patterns but the problem of course

342
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,839
is that it doesn't really test the end

343
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,710
result you can't know if if what you're

344
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,290
writing it even if it's correct even if

345
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,270
it's exactly the thing that you intended

346
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,100
when you wrote this style guide you

347
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,480
can't know that it looks the way you

348
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,750
want to and it's also quite useless

349
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,339
without the good set of rules and

350
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,679
they're like catch-22 with rules is that

351
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,530
unless you know what the problems could

352
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,050
be then you can't write the rules to

353
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,030
prevent it and if you know what the

354
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,490
problems are then you maybe you don't

355
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,829
need the style guide because you already

356
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,770
know what to avoid so it's it's more for

357
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,380
maybe like junior developers or when you

358
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,270
have a large team where you're not like

359
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,730
sharing the same hivemind so let's jump

360
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,570
onto the more like sophisticated

361
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,350
technologies the third one then would be

362
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,010
to to use screenshots to look at what

363
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,450
you're actually producing so you can you

364
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,520
can compare the look of the site before

365
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,300
you do some change and after and see did

366
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,210
it change the way I want it and do some

367
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,760
image diff between those two to see

368
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,510
exactly what happened and there are a

369
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,350
couple of tools for doing this one

370
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,809
particular one is called Huxley made by

371
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:09,840
Pete Hahn who's actually here today and

372
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,950
it's it's a tool for you you use it to

373
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,520
record a few steps in your app like I

374
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,960
click this thing I am through these

375
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,600
things and and so on and record what it

376
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,580
looks like and then you can play back

377
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,760
that later when you've changed something

378
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,220
to see did the right things change or

379
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,000
not and there are similar ones out there

380
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,790
as well like phantom CSS and and so on

381
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,950
but this is actually quite popular and

382
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,140
you can ask Pete all about it

383
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,940
and the good thing about screenshots of

384
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,980
course is that no change can sneak by

385
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,700
screenshots are the actual output that

386
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,270
we're after

387
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,030
that's pixel by pixel exactly the look

388
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,520
of of the thing we're creating and it's

389
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,350
totally implementation agnostic you can

390
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,750
use any language any any technology

391
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,000
whatever screenshots are screenshots

392
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,740
it's on on there but the negative part

393
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,260
of course is that it breaks on content

394
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,550
changes say that you have some element

395
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,460
of randomness in in your site you show

396
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,370
quote from a client for example on the

397
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,290
top and it loops between a number of

398
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,760
different quotes maybe it's not the same

399
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,270
when you reload or you have ads and the

400
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,070
ads are out of your control you can't

401
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,760
change them so you have to start like

402
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,370
looking at particular pieces of your app

403
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,990
and you you can't screenshot everything

404
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,200
because it's too fragile but it gets

405
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,730
complicated and you have to start

406
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,150
specifying it and it's it becomes messy

407
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,150
quickly and it yields lots of false

408
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,030
positives if you start comparing

409
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,550
browsers for example there are tiny tiny

410
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,380
rendering differences that you don't

411
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,990
really care about but that will break

412
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,390
screenshots because yeah it actually

413
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,590
looks a bit different

414
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,650
so you need some way to to filter out

415
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,280
what of these these dips are interesting

416
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,960
and which of them are not interesting so

417
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,720
quite some challenges there and I think

418
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,900
that's one of the motivations why people

419
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,780
ended up doing this fourth thing that

420
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,470
I'm going to talk about and that's

421
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,990
comparing styles directly in the Dom so

422
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,340
you walk through the entire Dom each and

423
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,740
every note and look at what what

424
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,350
particular styles are being applied to

425
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,980
this node and if it's the same styles

426
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,230
before and after a change then you know

427
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,570
that you haven't really you haven't

428
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,520
really changed anything you can't have

429
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,760
broken anything

430
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,120
and you you you compare these styles

431
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,690
that are in there to some expectation

432
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,160
for example something you had before or

433
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,280
by writing down like I want this thing

434
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,669
to be blue and one tool you can use for

435
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:08,330
doing this

436
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,140
it's called Hardy it's written by a

437
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,049
German guy called Simon and it's in a

438
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:18,290
very early version at this moment but

439
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,919
it's quite promising and he has been

440
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,679
working a lot on testing CSS so I think

441
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,330
this is definitely worth checking out

442
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,130
and as you can see down there it's a

443
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,590
node module so it's very easy to just

444
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,750
install it if you're already into

445
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,850
JavaScript which I guess everyone here

446
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,570
is and the thing you do with it is that

447
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,840
you you write very high-level

448
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,549
specifications of what you want your

449
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:47,299
site to be styled like maybe some of you

450
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:50,210
have actually seen cucumber before hands

451
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,640
up if you've seen it oh that's not a lot

452
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,220
I think it's more more popular in the

453
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,870
Ruby community but anyway cucumber is

454
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,460
it's a tool for writing specifications

455
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,540
in a natural language that you then can

456
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,700
process so you write something like this

457
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,770
like a given that I visit localhost then

458
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,250
the the P tags under section should have

459
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,890
the color 68 68 68 and this will be

460
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,080
checked and by Hardy that this is

461
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,960
actually the case and that's kind of

462
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,120
cool we're writing a test in the same

463
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,110
way as we're writing tests for

464
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,040
JavaScript or other parts of our

465
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,679
application but it's kind of tedious

466
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,850
right too to test one attribute on one

467
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,350
tag with this much text it would take

468
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,350
quite a lot of work to test everything

469
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,870
and also think about the fact that here

470
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,269
we're testing that particular styles are

471
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,159
being applied we don't know what it

472
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,710
looks like so we have no idea if this is

473
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:09,789
really what we want or not but just -

474
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,070
I'm coming back to this actually so just

475
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,960
to give you an idea of how cucumber is

476
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,880
typically used since there are a lot of

477
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,090
people who are not familiar with it you

478
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,890
usually do something like this like very

479
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,110
high level you say that this is a test

480
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,110
for seeing if the filter for our audio

481
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,630
books work so we say that given some

482
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,519
audio books in our collection when I

483
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,620
visit the list of audio books and search

484
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,350
for a particular term like core then I

485
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,789
only see the titles that are matching

486
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:39,340
and when I remove the filter then I see

487
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,350
all the audio books again so this is a

488
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,720
test that that you implement then using

489
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,789
cucumber you can go to the site and read

490
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:48,100
more about it if you're curious but this

491
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,289
is like typical acceptance testing we're

492
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:52,809
not unit testing pieces of our app but

493
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:55,899
rather can the user do the things that

494
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:57,820
we expect them to be able to do in our

495
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,679
application so testing CSS using this

496
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,799
idea is way more resilient to change

497
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,320
than using screenshots because we're

498
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,330
targeting very specific parts of our

499
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,970
code and the tests live on in another

500
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,039
way than then screenshots because

501
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,760
screenshots are kind of great and throw

502
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,190
away you don't build up the tests with

503
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:26,019
using using screenshots really so these

504
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:28,809
are saved in your code bases but it's a

505
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,510
big big con to having to write

506
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,730
expectations in code because that's not

507
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,269
how you work with visuals it's more

508
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,850
natural to like sit and fiddle in chrome

509
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,070
and try and change those colors and

510
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,870
experiment with your margins and so on

511
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,840
it would be madness to write these tests

512
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,529
beforehand

513
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,019
like I want five pixels of margin and I

514
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:52,090
have no idea what it looks like but

515
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,690
that's what I want and also of course

516
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,460
style rules are not the same thing as

517
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,580
looks because the site can still look

518
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,920
look wrong in different browsers on

519
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,300
different platforms than what you

520
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,230
intended and you're not testing that but

521
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,110
but as you as you here already there are

522
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,940
a couple of tools that you can use and

523
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,980
they all have different different like

524
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,929
use cases depending on what your problem

525
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:19,179
is you can choose pick and choose from

526
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,100
from all these and maybe you can use all

527
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,750
of them so so this kind of should be

528
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,640
good news to everyone right this is good

529
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,660
but let me ask you this how many of you

530
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,350
are in like a serious way using any of

531
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:44,590
these tools hands up and maybe there is

532
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,330
like two guys over there but it mostly

533
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,980
looks like this and why is that we have

534
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,590
tools maybe people are just not aware of

535
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,720
them maybe you had never heard of them

536
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,630
before so that's good I'm here telling

537
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,510
you about them but if you haven't heard

538
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,540
of them that probably means that people

539
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,760
are not that into them they're not

540
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,500
really using them in other places either

541
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,120
because then you would have heard of it

542
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,590
so something's wrong here and I think

543
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:21,610
this is my opinion but I think that CSS

544
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,790
is like in between two different

545
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,179
disciplines we have the developers who

546
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:29,020
are very strict

547
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,450
we're like everything is supposed to be

548
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,790
in nice little boxes and possible to

549
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,670
describe and dismantle in a very precise

550
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,670
way and then we have the designers who

551
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,809
are more about creating so there's some

552
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:48,790
missing piece here and what is it like

553
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,760
what is it that we have to change to

554
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,260
make these things usable in my opinion

555
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,070
it's about design first because CSS is

556
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,660
just a tool to realize your designs so

557
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,630
we should think how do we incorporate a

558
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,840
design first perspective into testing

559
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,560
what we're doing

560
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,290
so let's look back at the the testing

561
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,620
circle when we typically work with tests

562
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,770
we write the test that fails we

563
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,880
implement the code to make it work and

564
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,620
then we start refactoring to make

565
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,220
everything great my suggestion when it

566
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,810
comes to testing CSS is that we start by

567
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,090
creating the design we want because

568
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,630
that's the that's the purpose of of CSS

569
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:43,310
to have a design and then when we have

570
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,800
that design implemented in actual HTML

571
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,230
looking the way we want to in at least

572
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,440
one browser in in one news case then we

573
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,600
start to ensure the consistency across

574
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,750
browsers and devices and we also look at

575
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,120
the compatibility with the rest of our

576
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,000
code did we break something when we

577
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,040
created this new page and added new

578
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,840
styles or is everything else still

579
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,930
working and when we have done that when

580
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,700
we have ensured consistency and

581
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,010
compatibility then we can start

582
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,440
eliminating redundancy if we have a way

583
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,240
to automatically rerun that step and

584
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,600
this is this is actually mapping exactly

585
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,830
to this but it's the design that is the

586
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,280
test we need a way to make sure that the

587
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,890
design we have created becomes the test

588
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,970
the test is not something of its own and

589
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,070
then implementing the code that's not

590
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,680
about writing your first CSS making

591
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,020
making it show up in the browsers that's

592
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,810
about consistency across browsers and

593
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,730
compatibility with the rest of your code

594
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,820
because you all know that right

595
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,980
creating a design is not hard and

596
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,140
implementing it in CSS for one browser

597
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,630
in one use case that's easy the big job

598
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,870
is the the laggard browsers like getting

599
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,120
it work to work in ie6 like that's half

600
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,100
of the album at least and then the

601
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,050
mobile devices and everything so the

602
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,170
real work is done in number two and then

603
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,850
we can think about how do we eliminate

604
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:17,330
redundancies but we should not do some

605
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,060
magic new type of tests before

606
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,110
everything the design is the test

607
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,660
so let's talk about a possible fifth

608
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:32,030
option here we're thinking about this

609
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,460
again imagine that we have written

610
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,300
something like this we have a scenario

611
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,120
describing exactly what the user can do

612
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,930
and that tests that this is possible and

613
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,170
if you don't have this then I'm not

614
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,820
really sure that you should be worried

615
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,890
about whether your site looks right or

616
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,390
not because you have no idea if it's

617
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,940
working so you should start in that end

618
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,610
that's my opinion at least so start by

619
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,520
making sure your site works by using

620
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,920
selenium and cucumber capybara any of

621
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,040
those things and now we have user

622
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,830
stories we have descriptions of all the

623
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,809
things that the user can do in our

624
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:14,300
application so we don't have to do that

625
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,929
like manual recording for things we want

626
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,360
to test we already have the descriptions

627
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,370
of what we want to test and now the

628
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,860
question that remains is does it look

629
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,460
right

630
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,290
during those steps in our tests and well

631
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,080
how is the computer supposed to know if

632
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,690
it looks right because even if all the

633
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,630
browser's look exactly the same

634
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:43,550
maybe they often look like so this

635
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,090
is is creating the test you have written

636
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,250
something and now we want to say that

637
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,559
this is the thing this is the way I want

638
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,770
it to look this is working so just

639
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,920
imagine that we've created some simple

640
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,500
site like this and we had some some

641
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,140
plug-in or some bookmarklet in our site

642
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,380
that we could click on to say that now

643
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,020
this is right this looks like I want it

644
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,120
to look because you can't let the

645
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,330
computer decide if the looks is correct

646
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,960
or not but this browser at this

647
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,090
particular time with exactly this source

648
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,700
code this is what I want now we can

649
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,950
shove that away put put it in the cloud

650
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,760
do do screenshots do Dom sniffing use

651
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,900
all technologies there are two to

652
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,940
capture this state that the application

653
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,680
is in in

654
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,040
that browser and now we have to start

655
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,870
checking other browsers and see if the

656
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,380
rest of our app works well that's not

657
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,300
that hard because we already have tools

658
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,570
that do that given that would capture

659
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,990
the state like I told you before so we

660
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,750
could we could automatically run the

661
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,450
same tests in all other browsers using

662
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,510
selenium and all versions and so on and

663
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:06,160
all devices and see in how this was not

664
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,640
very clear but we can still get some

665
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,680
kind of list saying that in these four

666
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,410
you have deviations that look very

667
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,600
different from what you already what you

668
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,810
already have and we could show them and

669
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,720
guide the user to see where where are

670
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,630
the faults and since since we since we

671
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,390
based the tests on I'm jumping back now

672
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,600
but to on these things and these are

673
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,580
saved all the scenarios in our

674
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,730
applications are stored in our code base

675
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,860
when we run this thing we will also know

676
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,960
if all the other things that we had

677
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,210
before are still working the way they

678
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,870
used to before we wrote our new code so

679
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,310
now we just have to go through this in

680
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,050
kind of the same way that you would do

681
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,510
with image diffs to mark the diffs and

682
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,760
say that this change is intended and

683
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,120
this change is not intended and maybe

684
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,610
certain TV ange deviations that are not

685
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,790
intended changes but our rendering

686
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,520
differences and so on you can you can

687
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,860
mark them as okay as well if you think

688
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,050
that it's okay that it looks this way in

689
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,410
this browser and when you've resolved

690
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,750
everything it all passes everything is

691
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,120
green and the test tool now tells you

692
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,180
that everything works so now you can go

693
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,010
to the third step and you can start

694
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,610
moving CSS around you can start deleting

695
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,670
attributes that you think are are dead

696
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,790
and so on and you can see does this test

697
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,130
still pass does it produce the same

698
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,210
thing

699
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:48,080
so to kind of get the gist of this the

700
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,390
idea is that the sign is manual

701
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,550
you can't automate the sign you have to

702
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,240
you have to create some layout and the

703
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,020
definition of correct that's also manual

704
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,120
it's in the same way that you're writing

705
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,490
your tests in in JavaScript for

706
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,520
JavaScript is manual then defining what

707
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,890
is the right look that's also manual you

708
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,020
have to do that yourself that's your job

709
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,860
but testing changes that's automatic and

710
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,960
can be done using various different

711
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,870
technologies that we have further down

712
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:25,700
the stack so it's about design first and

713
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,870
design as tests not tests as some

714
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:35,140
separate entity and if we look at the

715
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,990
the ups and downs for for this thing

716
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,970
what's what's the pros and what's the

717
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,190
cons well we're jacking into the

718
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,930
acceptance tests that are already there

719
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,950
and that's useful because it means that

720
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,210
there are a ton of things that we don't

721
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,880
have to set up we assume that acceptance

722
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,980
tests are there so we can somehow deploy

723
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,470
to a staging site we have a staging

724
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,240
environment that we can up

725
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,000
completely if we want to and we have

726
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,770
already described all the possible

727
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,720
scenarios that the user will go through

728
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,880
and like I said if you don't have that

729
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,770
already then then you have bigger

730
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,700
problems obviously so this also gives us

731
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,290
this thing that we don't need a record

732
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,540
step we already know what kind of steps

733
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,250
we want to go through that we want to

734
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,860
test and there's no convoluted the

735
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,830
science back saying in encode what the

736
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,840
design should be like but you have

737
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,360
looked at the design at a design and

738
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,540
stated that this was what I wanted this

739
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,780
is the way it's supposed to look now

740
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,900
there there's one big con to this and

741
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,680
it's that it's make-believe so this is

742
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,960
the actual mythic part of the

743
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,660
presentation to be honest it's not

744
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,630
entirely make-believe because I've been

745
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,130
working on something like this with a

746
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,829
couple of my colleagues

747
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:57,970
but it split into pieces across a number

748
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:02,230
of of proprietary code bases so it's

749
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,780
kind of hard to extract it we started

750
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,790
working on this because we want to make

751
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,589
a tool out of this that people can use

752
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:15,250
but I ended up getting a new job that

753
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,079
takes a lot of energy and I haven't had

754
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:20,740
time to finish this thing so if we look

755
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,619
back at at my initial idea like the the

756
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:26,410
purpose of the presentation I wanted to

757
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,680
to raise some awareness and I hope I've

758
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,589
done that you've seen a couple of tools

759
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,740
and you can you can also look for like

760
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,930
their their competition if you want to

761
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,210
see others but these are the types of

762
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,130
tools these for that are the most

763
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,069
popular at least and then I wanted to

764
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,130
inspire you to this new workflow a new

765
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,980
way of thinking about design and testing

766
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,460
that a design is correct but there's a

767
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,180
third thing and it's the fact that I I

768
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,930
feel like all these tools are hard to

769
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,510
get started with testing is hard to

770
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,490
begin with and this type of testing is

771
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,970
even harder but I still feel like we

772
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,180
have to get further we have to create

773
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,160
something more and make this more

774
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,549
accessible easier to use for everyone to

775
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:21,730
get started with it so what I would be

776
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,579
really happy for would be for you to

777
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:28,630
kind of join into the discussion I'm

778
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,970
sure a lot of you have opinions about

779
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,640
this you have ideas you have been things

780
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,190
yourselves you have faced challenges

781
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,290
that you think that a tool like this

782
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,890
wouldn't solve good or bad all kinds of

783
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,099
feedback can be used to take us all like

784
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:48,280
a bit further - to figure out what we

785
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,319
what we really need what's the next

786
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:53,109
thing and of course actually working on

787
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:55,270
it if someone were to to make a

788
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,010
prototype that would do something like

789
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,890
this without all the messy code that I

790
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,990
already have I I would be more than

791
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,750
happy so this is not my idea this is an

792
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,540
open idea

793
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,230
and you have you have my twitter handle

794
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,810
you have the the J's comb Twitter handle

795
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:15,350
you have the the shat on the site we

796
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,200
have IRC start talking everywhere start

797
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,359
talking about this thing and see is this

798
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:21,859
something we really need or is it just

799
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:26,420
in my mind and that's all I wanted to

800
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,450
say about automated CSS testing thank

801
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:36,920
you all right thank you take it and as

802
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,540
usual if anyone has any more questions

803
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:43,520
for Jacob just raise your hands since we

804
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,530
have a couple of minutes extra I have a

805
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,560
tiny favor to ask of you and it's it's

806
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,150
since the Wi-Fi is amazing at this

807
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,210
conference it's really great we should

808
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,210
do a little load test so that there's a

809
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,000
tiny URL down there and I see a lot of

810
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,460
computers and I guess a lot of you have

811
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,490
smartphones so if you would use one

812
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:11,980
minute to go onto that and and answer

813
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,220
three short questions about this thing I

814
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,200
would be very happy because it would

815
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,140
help like help us to know whether or not

816
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,510
we should pursue this and like finish

817
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,910
our idea when we find the time or if

818
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,660
it's like totally uninteresting hi I'm

819
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,950
just wondering how you'd work this into

820
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,720
kind of in the iterative design

821
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,119
environment I did you wait till the

822
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,160
design is finished and then build all

823
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,869
the tests are you kind of doing them in

824
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:40,700
parallel with your design as it's

825
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,120
changing

826
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,670
when you say designer do you mean a

827
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:52,319
person who is just making like Photoshop

828
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:54,760
mock-ups or someone who's actually

829
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,520
writing CSS as well to me the only valid

830
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,700
web designer is one who can code as well

831
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,640
someone who is a coding designer yeah

832
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,230
yeah and that's the best kind obviously

833
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,310
that's that's the one I would work with

834
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:12,400
so so the question was how to work it

835
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,579
wrestle with that kind of person like

836
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,440
between developer and designer yeah I

837
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,880
guess the thing is trying to reduce the

838
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:29,470
other hit of yeah and ideally this would

839
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,450
all be something that a designer could

840
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:36,130
use on his or her own like you should

841
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,930
not have to think about programming when

842
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,000
you do this mmm that's why for example

843
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,300
you want to get away from the writing of

844
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,000
a test specification and so on you want

845
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,950
this to just be about looking at

846
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,410
something and saying yeah this is what I

847
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,800
want and now it's correct and then a

848
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,160
designer who's working with CSS they can

849
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,980
obviously already start fiddling with

850
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,109
their code and see if things changes and

851
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:04,750
run this again you don't as a designer

852
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,930
you don't have to learn anything new to

853
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:11,890
to do this thing you just have to have

854
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,599
to run this tune whenever you feel like

855
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,270
you you're finished is it not working

856
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,470
everywhere and so on

857
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,780
so I I definitely think it would be

858
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:26,170
perfect for working iteratively yeah

859
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:32,290
well and I mean after it depends what

860
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,500
you mean with after I I would say that

861
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,390
creating the design is a small part of

862
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,640
the work and then making it work in all

863
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,410
places and with the rest of your code

864
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,599
that's the large work and you do it both

865
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,510
you do it between those steps and after

866
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,550
the last one as well for refactoring and

867
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,460
so on so it should be something that you

868
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,770
do continuously as soon as you you feel

869
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,030
like you've designed something that's

870
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,430
complete

871
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,559
but you're not sure if it works

872
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,510
everywhere else and with the rest of

873
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,079
your code
