[Applause]

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,019
hi everyone welcome to my talks here

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,150
some days we were - hi my name is

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,710
Catherine and not a next thing isn't

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:24,300
working ok so at first I have to make

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,430
confession to you and the confession is

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,340
I love makeup tutorials and I really

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,059
enjoy watching them on YouTube and so I

9
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,170
have one favorite YouTube artist and so

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,360
this person is a professional makeup

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,430
artist and special effects makeup artist

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,969
in Hollywood and I love her videos

13
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,280
because she focuses mostly on tutorials

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,020
some of our about beauty makeup others

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,000
are about special effects makeup like

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,550
zombies and stuff and on top she has a

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,820
very cute dog and for me it is enough to

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,780
love her but she has many many fans that

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,290
love her too and so because they love

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,820
her and because she's a professional

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,830
makeup artist in Hollywood a lot of

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,880
people ask her for product

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,880
recommendations because she knows her

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,150
stuff and also people want to recreate

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,580
the look she is creating and hopefully

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,710
with the same products it gives the same

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,650
outcome and also other people like to

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,080
feel closer to this artist by using

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,619
their products so far so good that's

30
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,299
more or less a win-win situation for

31
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,479
everybody but sometimes bad things

32
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,259
happens and this is when the product

33
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,110
becomes equal to the person and then

34
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,780
someone maybe has something to criticize

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,890
maybe it's a legit criticism about one

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,320
of the products but then for fans it

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,970
becomes that they are criticizing the

38
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,850
artist and fans really march in and say

39
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,549
oh yeah you cannot do that and this

40
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,619
creates a very toxic environment where

41
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,899
people are silenced or too afraid to

42
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,450
speak up even though there is a legit

43
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,170
point on criticizing something but this

44
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,140
is not track on does a CSS con so let's

45
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,740
talk a little

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,950
at CSS birthdays things see this is the

47
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,930
makeup of the web because you can put

48
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,030
litter on it and so here we as a family

49
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,440
the deaf community and we also have our

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,750
influencers and ninja developers ten

51
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,540
times developers our rock stars and we

52
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,680
love them and also their products me

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,590
love and products that get criticized

54
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,920
and why are we criticizing again the

55
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,460
person so we have the same toxic

56
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,620
environment as the people on YouTube and

57
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,720
makeup oh my god

58
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,760
things like when you're get happen so

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,280
everybody maybe follow that link if they

60
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,340
want to know what's on so let's just say

61
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,850
the hyper suil and the thing is the hack

62
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,680
was not only real ever since we have

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,170
things like YouTube and Instagram and

64
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,470
everything no does assault justice as

65
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,080
old as the you are a society that formed

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,760
in 1660 and asked this problem of having

67
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,070
influences back in the day it was mostly

68
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,550
a Lord that said something is very old

69
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,890
and then you had someone else that wants

70
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,140
to criticize the sword and they say yeah

71
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,700
but you cannot criticize this person

72
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,400
he's rich she's wealthy he's a lord and

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,220
so I said you know what no yours Envy

74
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,340
ever that's our motto no Leo's endeavor

75
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,000
is Latin and translates to take nobody's

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,010
word for it and it is described as an

77
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,850
expression after determination our

78
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,480
fellows to withstand the authority of to

79
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,810
verify all statements by an appeal to

80
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,280
facts determined by experiment because

81
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,470
my should you believe me I don't even

82
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,130
have 500 followers on Twitter instead I

83
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,780
want to let the facts speak for me okay

84
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,580
but before we jump into shiny tools and

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,390
stuff let's ask a question what is wrong

86
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,030
with CSS I mean y'all here we all love

87
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,070
CSS but

88
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,490
something is wrong and yeah one thing

89
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,509
that is very wrong is the first paint

90
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:35,599
because science and statistics have

91
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:38,150
shown that when the first paint is

92
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,699
delayed already by half a second the

93
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,919
user satisfaction really decreases and

94
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,470
also with the user satisfaction our

95
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,160
conversion rate decreases because in

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,919
classic web the browser does dis it

97
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,180
starts downloading the HTML and then

98
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,039
when it's finished with the HTML it

99
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:00,830
starts downloading the CSS and only when

100
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,409
it has both downloaded and interpreted

101
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:06,349
it can start painting so which means

102
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:09,560
that he is as render blocking so it

103
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,169
keeps our user from seeing our page and

104
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:14,960
therefore sees as the bad guy and so we

105
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,750
have to bring it as quick and as soon as

106
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,830
possible to our users ok so what can we

107
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,919
do about that let's let's fix it so

108
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,349
first of all there is a very nice thing

109
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,380
that people from browsers and other

110
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,710
people have done and this is HTTP 2

111
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,759
because HTTP 2 has the approach of

112
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,340
starting HTML and starting C that's at

113
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,590
the same time because this is able to

114
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,630
have multiple downloads with the same

115
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,539
TCP connection which means we are faster

116
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:52,460
but still sometimes the CSS file can be

117
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,039
very big I can tell you like in one

118
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,380
company I worked I had a CSS file that

119
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,030
was nearly 1 megabyte so this was a ruby

120
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:09,560
monolith so yes so what can we do we can

121
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,280
also split our CSS into meaningful parts

122
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,979
because we only need to have two CSS of

123
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:19,550
the stuff we show and so we are already

124
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,710
very smart and putting our HTML on our

125
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,590
JavaScript so why not create one chunk

126
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,849
of both of them and only render stuff we

127
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,719
need to see right now and cut this in

128
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,199
small chunks which means

129
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,360
this great solution because we only

130
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,999
download what is necessary and don't

131
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:44,080
delay any rendering okay now finally

132
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,419
tools so one very very popular tool to

133
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,719
approach the CSS and J's thing is called

134
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:55,180
sty components it is an NPM package for

135
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,590
react and yeah in nine components you

136
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,810
are now finally allowed to get rid of

137
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,360
that dot CSS file you just write all

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,870
your Styles in your JavaScript and then

139
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,419
you can probably configure it with the

140
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:13,770
use of bubble and here Jeremy screaming

141
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,449
and if you don't want to use sty

142
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,339
components there are other packages some

143
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:21,330
would be mentioning worth mentioning is

144
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,759
emotional and then you just add it to

145
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,729
your package in your react and then you

146
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:31,029
import style from stock components then

147
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:33,069
you write your CSS and your JavaScript

148
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,960
and then you can return it as a

149
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,759
higher-order component and just use it

150
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,490
as any other react up on it great

151
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,490
another approach is a different kind

152
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,789
where you let your build process work

153
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:48,370
for you and for that there are bungalo -

154
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,430
it's like web pack so this is a bundle

155
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,449
for node and this works like that that

156
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,939
it's collecting all your assets like

157
00:07:57,939 --> 00:07:59,979
your CSS combines it with your

158
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,319
JavaScript and then splits it into small

159
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,560
chunks so exactly what we want and then

160
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,919
of course it has a huge configuration

161
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,409
possibility yada yada and if you don't

162
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:13,629
want to use webpack there's a popular

163
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:16,620
alternative which is called parcel and

164
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,509
so as I said you just can import a

165
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:22,509
normal vanilla CSS file or a CSS file if

166
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,870
you want and then configure in the

167
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,029
bubble convict as CSS our CSS loader

168
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,639
great okay so as I said we're doing

169
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,789
fact-checking here this is science so

170
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,099
what are we going to look into so first

171
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,019
of all we want to solve our render

172
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,029
blocking problems so we want to go fast

173
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,150
and then another very famous problem

174
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,460
we heard from Mike is scoping and naming

175
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:56,120
and um has to be heard from earlier we

176
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,940
also are super fancy about stage so

177
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,750
let's you state question number one now

178
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,900
have you fast yet I said we're going to

179
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,380
experiment but we just my cat call and

180
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,780
for Karl I built a website which I'm

181
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,250
going to use to experiment

182
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,740
it's called Park Club and it pops up you

183
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,260
can upload a picture wait something

184
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,800
about you and other cats can comment and

185
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
if you want to also play along with it

186
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,210
after this talk and here's to get up to

187
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,060
it and so does my experiment it's just a

188
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,420
very tiny react application and I have

189
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,450
set it up in three variations one is

190
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,700
with vanilla CSS this is going to be my

191
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,030
control group and so there I just have

192
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,820
written one CSS file and this one CSS

193
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,870
file I included in the index dot HTML

194
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,540
the other one version is the one with

195
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,000
backpack where I have also set up a CSS

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,700
loader and then of course the third

197
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,450
variation is the components and then I

198
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,760
have used the performance tool on the

199
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,290
Chrome browser and as you can see in the

200
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,880
frame part of the performance tool we

201
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,190
can see that on the mark of 250

202
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,770
milliseconds we have our first

203
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,720
meaningful render so the thing I said

204
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,180
earlier that we have a blank page before

205
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,550
we actually see it is true and it takes

206
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,590
around 500 milliseconds for our tiny

207
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,680
tests to fully be loaded and in a

208
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
summary part of the performance so you

209
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,420
can see how many time we spend on

210
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,550
rendering loading and scripting and

211
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,540
painting but I focused mostly on loading

212
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,930
and scripting because so loading is

213
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,870
influenced by the file of file size and

214
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,320
of course by the connection of the user

215
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,310
because nobody wants to travel the

216
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,280
deutsche bahn and surf

217
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,480
so and then scripting time which is

218
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,770
influenced by the complexity of our

219
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,770
script and of course again the file size

220
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,550
which goes along with the complexity and

221
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,710
then it is also dependent on the user's

222
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,230
device so if someone has a very old

223
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,160
cranky phone this will also be heavily

224
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,710
influencing our scripting time and so I

225
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,930
did just test several times and

226
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,530
calculated an average and so we can see

227
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,310
data for the vanilla CSS we have around

228
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,030
60 milliseconds floating around 100

229
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,270
milliseconds of scripting and to prove

230
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,160
my other argument that the bigger the

231
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,890
file the more loading time we have I

232
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,930
just added for fun bootstrap CSS to it I

233
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,640
didn't even use any of the bootstrap I

234
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,070
just included it also in the HTML file

235
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,280
and when I had done that the loading

236
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,190
time increased already significantly as

237
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,010
I set aside average numbers I calculated

238
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,010
over I don't know how many times so then

239
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,410
the next approach was the web pack one

240
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,050
where we decreased again our loading

241
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,240
time because even though the bootstrap

242
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,790
was still there it wasn't used so it's

243
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,600
not downloaded and also understand

244
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,660
component side we had an even more

245
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,420
decrease of the loading time but if you

246
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,060
look close there is a huge and

247
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,430
significant increase on the scripting

248
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,710
time and you might have heard this

249
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,990
already the people say the CSS and J's

250
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,760
is bad on your performance and so we

251
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,330
asked ourselves why is that so if you

252
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,770
now look in the virtual DOM and denotes

253
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,320
that the visual Thomas rendering so as I

254
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,080
said I have the same set up for all of

255
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,290
my variations and on the component side

256
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,330
it's the same so this is the few of the

257
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,900
components for the vanilla CSS and the

258
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,600
web pack version so where we can see I

259
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,120
have a blog I have a button component

260
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,950
and all those kind of things but when we

261
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,930
have a look at the one from site

262
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,750
components

263
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,370
it doesn't even fit on the screen and

264
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,540
now we can read that okay so

265
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,470
implementation looks like this I have my

266
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,450
style block container and then I

267
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,940
returned this higher-order component

268
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,160
which I have to do in order to be able

269
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,090
to use the style components while on the

270
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,360
epic variation I only can just add a

271
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,320
class to it like I would normally do and

272
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,930
this means that instead components for

273
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,210
every normal container I have a

274
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,180
higher-order container that is giving me

275
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,080
my CSS and this is also context using so

276
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,520
I have around four nodes instead of one

277
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,700
when I have to backpack variation so

278
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,790
what did we learn now so yeah if you

279
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,800
have a very small website you still can

280
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,660
use modular CSS but be warned so if the

281
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,470
CSS and J's approach is very strong the

282
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,150
bigger hue application is growing

283
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,670
because it can not grow over a certain

284
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,440
threshold by chunking your JavaScript

285
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,120
and your CSS together but be aware there

286
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,070
is definitely a scripting time increase

287
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,170
so your performance is getting lower the

288
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,560
more of the JavaScript you're using okay

289
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,520
number two can we finally scope now okey

290
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,230
the promise of style component is that

291
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,190
we don't have to think about this

292
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,980
anymore so it's a common problem you

293
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,320
probably have everybody can not think a

294
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,980
second about what color this button has

295
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,350
it's plum of course even though the

296
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,710
primary classes later in the file the

297
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,970
class that is combining two class names

298
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,790
is stronger and this is why we very

299
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,850
often end up in a complex thing like

300
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,550
this we just add more classes to a

301
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,310
component in order to give it finally

302
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,770
the style we want it and this is bad

303
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,710
nobody can remember any of these classes

304
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,589
later and also just brings you in a spot

305
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:12,140
where you don't feel safe to delete any

306
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,560
of

307
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,440
CSS and this is how you end up in a CSS

308
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,980
file that's one megabyte big

309
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,930
okay so sty components what can you do

310
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,570
for us as I said we have this component

311
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,210
with style and the higher-order

312
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,750
component and when we render this it

313
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,750
generates a class for us and the package

314
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,000
itself promises us that this is more or

315
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,060
less an ID so it's unique and it will

316
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,029
only be used one time on the same

317
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:45,620
component and it also uses this giberish

318
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,410
class name to add our Styles here so

319
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,170
we're sure this no leaking it is always

320
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,990
one strong selector awesome

321
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,510
six months later someone comes in and

322
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,930
says oh we have a park on that component

323
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,790
so you look in your development tools

324
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,240
and the questions start evolving like

325
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,040
where the heck is that code from income

326
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,210
coming from and what do these classes

327
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,150
mean I mean why is it purple is it meant

328
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,670
to be like the main action is it only

329
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,930
for this page I have no clue and why

330
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:28,460
always so I did go to github and looked

331
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,400
at the issues but if I did something

332
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,800
wrong and one of the contributors

333
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,280
answered and said like oh this is done

334
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,370
by intent we want to have two classes

335
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,890
with only one is styled so one of them

336
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,040
is used for identifying this in our site

337
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,230
component context and I'm like yeah

338
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,910
great that you can identify your

339
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,220
component and I can so please how can I

340
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,280
do it oh yeah I said Bubble Bobble for

341
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,230
the rescue yes

342
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,920
it's Jeremy already crying and so we add

343
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,850
bubble to our system it's another NPM

344
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:09,079
package and then we top-level did we

345
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,530
have this plug-in and if you don't want

346
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,150
to configure bubble or ourselves because

347
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,179
we are lazy and use create react app or

348
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,610
we don't have access to our context we

349
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,120
can also use bubble macros and import

350
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,530
then the macro instead

351
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,580
of the actual site component and then

352
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,040
finally we have a meaningful readable

353
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,630
name on this thing that doesn't change

354
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,420
every time we load the freaking page so

355
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:42,070
yes okay but beware our apocalypse

356
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,590
because you once started very meaningful

357
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,160
by creating one component named wrapper

358
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,560
and then you start to add something

359
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,720
general to it to it because it's your

360
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,360
layout things so you add some more CSS

361
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,780
and call it web component and then

362
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,980
somewhere in a block container is

363
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,190
somebody named it again wrapper and edit

364
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,810
more style to it and yeah so I have

365
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:13,880
again this long class names that nobody

366
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,520
can understand and read and this is to

367
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,130
see this that goes with it but don't

368
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,170
think you will find any of the CSS in

369
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,000
any of the classes you have written on

370
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,950
there because for example I can assure

371
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,620
you that border is not living in la

372
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,630
crapper I don't know where it is coming

373
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,680
from okay web pack so what can you do

374
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,780
for us nothing because web pack is a

375
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,510
bundler and has nothing to do with how

376
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:43,310
we architect our power system but when

377
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,410
you're all listen to Mike we have some

378
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,660
tools we can use because we can use

379
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,490
naming conventions like BEM

380
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,370
so we can make a card and take hard

381
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,120
image and have modifiers and we also can

382
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,080
use design patterns like atomic design

383
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,200
where we have small big and large things

384
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,810
and if you are combine this we maybe end

385
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,980
up with a design system so architecture

386
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,350
can help us here and so then we maybe

387
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,690
have class name which we have written

388
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,000
ourselves which is then like something

389
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,160
like comment from text field and if you

390
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,960
compare this to this like components

391
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,750
once it's not even that far away so sky

392
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,820
component also uses naming convention

393
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,820
and still uses your names

394
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,979
and then I hear somebody screaming

395
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:36,919
naming his heart I don't know what I

396
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,960
should name the things my designer comes

397
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,289
up with after a long weekend on the pub

398
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:47,149
and yeah I have experienced the same so

399
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:49,580
sometimes my designer comes up and shows

400
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,440
me something and I don't know what I

401
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,749
should frickin name it and then some

402
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:55,850
people just call it shining our fancy

403
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,159
and then it's the fancy rapper but I

404
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,309
have an utter solution yeah if you can't

405
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:07,340
name it you don't need it seriously

406
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,739
because when my designer comes up with

407
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:11,779
something and I only want to call it

408
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:14,149
fancy rapper I go back to my designer

409
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:17,840
and ask them some questions like what

410
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,489
problem of our user is this solving is

411
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,289
it maybe a variation of something we

412
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,769
already have or is it a combination of

413
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,769
some things we already have and also

414
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:32,869
what is it semantic meaning is it a

415
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,960
primary thing is it a call to action

416
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,349
what are we doing and if you two people

417
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:41,720
or more still not able to answer these

418
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,059
questions and now still not able to find

419
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,820
a name for the thing then please just

420
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,220
get rid of it I promise you you will not

421
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,440
miss it learning's so the generated

422
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,590
names as helpful they might be they also

423
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,629
do a lot of harm especially when you

424
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:02,929
want to maintain your stuff please

425
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,359
collaborate with your designers makes

426
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,229
things so much easier and yeah pattern

427
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:11,450
and conventions they're always helpful

428
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,429
no matter if you used our components or

429
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:15,979
not it will help you keep the oversight

430
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:20,779
off your coat okay number three props

431
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,970
state I want to have it

432
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,080
I live in JavaScript and I live in a

433
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,809
stateful environment so I have a couple

434
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:31,879
of buttons and all of them are able to

435
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:34,369
get inactive and so when they're

436
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:36,019
inactive they of course have to reflect

437
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:40,700
the state to my user wire visually okay

438
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,190
the classic approach as we already have

439
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,340
seen is just adding

440
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,230
a couple of classes to it nobody wants

441
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,100
to remember that and it's that we want

442
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,110
yeah having variation on it and then

443
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,630
using the state so this is where we want

444
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,580
to go and sty components is here to help

445
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,120
us because we are in JavaScript so we

446
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,510
can write JavaScript in RS CSS which is

447
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,690
in JavaScript so we can use error

448
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:12,870
functions and if and more ifs Morris

449
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,980
okay so I think now Mike is crying and I

450
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,669
am crying so but maybe maybe this is all

451
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:24,690
worth it let's have a look so oh yes we

452
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,870
have one class name yes yes yes and I

453
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,190
don't need to remember this class and

454
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,640
great because there's a so generate it

455
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,330
and I can see the props but somehow I

456
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,789
don't have a connection between the used

457
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:42,240
attribute and the props so yes and then

458
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,950
my designer comes in and says oh yeah I

459
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,630
have a new variation we now have an

460
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,880
alternative button and I'm getting a

461
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,840
headache web pack so web pack now here

462
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,399
same problem as before where peck

463
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:58,020
doesn't do anything for you in this case

464
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,169
you just can go back to our architecture

465
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:05,250
and so we just try to write some BEM

466
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,690
classes with modifiers and then we are

467
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,600
now writing our own higher-order

468
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,149
function component which is now our

469
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:17,940
button and I'm using a very small tool I

470
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,890
found it very helpful which is called

471
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,440
class names and this is basically just

472
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,750
doing some string operations for me

473
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,080
because I'm lazy and so I have no my

474
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,500
props the same as before variant and the

475
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,190
inactive state and then I use those

476
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,669
class names package where I'm like

477
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,770
combining my classes based on those

478
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,640
props and the state and then I'm just

479
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,649
adding these classes to this component

480
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:49,110
button component and then I just can't

481
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,840
return it and also there's this very

482
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,690
helpful thing called prop types and

483
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,559
there I can define like

484
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,159
example what variations are possible so

485
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,499
I can expose to everybody that is using

486
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:04,929
this component what props are there and

487
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:08,409
what they can use and also I can set

488
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:11,980
default props which is very helpful if I

489
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,659
just want to use one button without

490
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:16,840
thinking too much and it is used like

491
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,549
this and that looks like the thing from

492
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:20,049
the beginning we wanted it looks the

493
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:23,110
same and rendered it looks like the

494
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,759
thing we didn't want but we don't care

495
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,769
because we didn't write this ourselves

496
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:30,279
and this is this looks now as we know it

497
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,309
so we have our modifier clusters and we

498
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,889
can clearly see what attribute is

499
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:39,519
triggered by which modifier so thank you

500
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,899
architecture you helped us yeah so the

501
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,860
learnings here is that there is a hard

502
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,970
way to connect the attributes from CSS

503
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,009
to the attributes you put on our

504
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:57,070
components so the development tools are

505
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,730
not there yet to support us in this way

506
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,809
so maybe this will change hopefully then

507
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:07,749
one thing that is dangerous in most

508
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:11,289
cases which is mixing props that are

509
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:13,929
only there for styling with props that

510
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,450
are there for functions because

511
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,740
sometimes when you didn't change

512
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,629
something you are not sure entirely

513
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:22,570
which is triggering a style and which is

514
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,909
triggering a function so this is a

515
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:27,600
warning I want to just announce for all

516
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,259
solutions then yes again architectural

517
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:34,899
pattern conventions even though we hope

518
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,730
the tools are going to solve this for us

519
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,429
are always helpful

520
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:41,740
let's summarize our three effects we

521
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,289
wanted to check so

522
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:47,200
sty components fast loading but it

523
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,610
definitely comes with a cost of

524
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,619
performance so you have to watch out

525
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:53,470
what you're doing there web pack yeah

526
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:57,179
sure a little bit but it's JavaScript so

527
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,999
yeah naming I'm scoping it has good

528
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:03,399
approach but I'm not too sure about it

529
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:06,460
so I definitely would not go without

530
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,679
conventions namings architecture as

531
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,340
these

532
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,860
yes and I can use the same architecture

533
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,170
tools for going with whatever other

534
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,860
solution I want the same is for the

535
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,060
props and a styling part and I can use

536
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,100
some little tools like the class names

537
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,890
package to help me solving my

538
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,760
architectural problems to be honest the

539
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,690
prop thingy it really scares me a lot so

540
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,580
I would not use it without any

541
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,140
conventions of patterns so should we use

542
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,280
tools of our conventions and patterns I

543
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,110
say it's not a nor question we can have

544
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,470
both because tools should always support

545
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,890
to retain our patterns and conventions

546
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,040
so tools should not be necessarily there

547
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,740
to solve all your problems but to help

548
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,290
you solving your problems to make it

549
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,570
easy for you to follow the conventions

550
