1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:22,790
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:28,119
The less serious talk is linking to anything
on the web.

3
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,929
My focus will be around text content.

4
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,890
Some of this is more applicable to that.

5
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,960
You can go into iframes and images.

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,930
My focus has been more on the journalism side.

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,140
Blog post, articles.

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,750
And just while I am here I tried adding German
to the slides.

9
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,750
And failed.

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:59,199
You have seen some of the workings of Google
translate.

11
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,030
The population speaks my language so well.

12
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,230
I don't have a word of German.

13
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,110
I tried to brush up.

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,600
But life, work, anyway.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Good to be here.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,310
As you said, I worked at journalism companies.

17
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,909
12 years in total.

18
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,250
At the New Yorker.

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,540
Prior to that Quartz.

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,549
An american business focused news startup.

21
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,340
And New York Times.

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,259
Frontend, platform.

23
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:45,680
And at the New York Times I stumbled upon
the problem we try to figure out.

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,630
It is about links.

25
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,259
These amazing things for the web.

26
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:53,380
They bind everything together.

27
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,890
Everything we have built today goes back in
a shape.

28
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,899
Move from 1 document to another.

29
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:08,320
Within links would be, it is like the Dna.

30
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,060
If you see a good descriptive link, that is
beauty.

31
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,030
To find its place on the web.

32
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,930
But also has meaning in itself in readability.

33
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,629
Not Sco.

34
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:30,610
It is something that is definition and context
is a big win.

35
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,599
That will only get you so far.

36
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,400
The problem I'm trying to solve.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,510
It is a solved problem.

38
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,870
Built upon, is linking within the documents.

39
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,680
You get to the page.

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,750
What next?

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,770
And there is a question of doing that in a
reliable way.

42
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:56,260
Right now, people are probably saying that
we have that solution.

43
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,150
It is Url fragments.

44
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,840
Whatever you call them.

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:10,569
If you take a look at that landscape, you
find it is not many anchor tags out there.

46
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:11,970
Used reliably.

47
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:20,760
Most of the anchor tags I have seen that are
in the document are usually there, they wanted

48
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,180
to do something to fill it.

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,610
Why is the page jumping pack up when I click
this.

50
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,049
The other problem I have with the url fragments
is, it is a manual process.

51
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,799
People don't want to do manual things.

52
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,210
It is hard to get journalists to moderate
articles on their own.

53
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:50,030
But going in and find, even to understand
markup.

54
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,510
You have a Cms or system that will not expose
them.

55
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,280
And you know, when it is a manual process
and you try to name things.

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,879
I'd be better off to explain cache and validation
than anchor tags.

57
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,850
There are a few things you can do.

58
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,390
Sequential numbering pattern.

59
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,810
People don't do it.

60
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,920
People are abstracted on a Cms level.

61
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,550
They are not typically the used case.

62
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,100
In the Cms, you do have the ability to generate
these.

63
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
What you can do.

64
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,580
Generate them in a structured manner.

65
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:45,260
But then the problem we are trying to solve
is that many writers, their work will change.

66
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,860
If you have an article.

67
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,720
We didn't change the articles very much.

68
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,690
Only if there was a known error or correction.

69
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,750
Every now and then, between the time published
to 10 minutes.

70
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:06,250
There was a window that changed dramatically.

71
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,420
Something would be rephrased.

72
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,390
It didn't happen often.

73
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,900
They don't like to do it.

74
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,530
It did happen from time to time.

75
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,170
The worst thing you can do is have a deeplink
to a paragraph.

76
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,370
You are doing that with a purpose.

77
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,680
Something here important.

78
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,810
If you are landing somewhere else, that's
a problem.

79
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,000
How do you do that without digging into Cms.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,870
Track these keys.

81
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,680
That map upto content that is changing.

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
It is a very hard thing to describe.

83
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,740
It leads to crazy situations.

84
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,740
You are trying to match them up.

85
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,740
Within Drupal or WordPress.

86
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,740
It is not something we would like to do.

87
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
So, you take JavaScript and reinvent what
is solving the problem.

88
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
There are a few approaches.

89
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,040
The steps is, you need to be able to generate
key off content.

90
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
To be tolerant.

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,720
If the context of the paragraph, I'm using
it as example.

92
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,060
If that changes and the key changes.

93
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,010
Do you use that pairing.

94
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,010
In tollerance again.

95
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,010
It can be updated, corrected.

96
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,010
Sentences are rearranged.

97
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,220
You don't want a system, when it goes out
of sync you have to giggle around to match

98
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,220
up again.

99
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,347
The other thing you have to accept, in the
web.You need something that will cover 90%

100
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:10,347
of the cases.

101
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:11,347
There is an acceptable margin of error.

102
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,347
When you fail, you fail back to the original
Url.

103
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:13,990
You need to deliver the person at the correct
location.

104
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,990
There are a couple of methods.

105
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,990
5-6 different pretty detailed methods that
I'm going to dig into 2 of them.

106
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,990
The first one I recommend.

107
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,990
It is dynamic unique keys.

108
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,800
You take a piece of text, generate keys from
it by the first 3 words, of the first and

109
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
last sentence.

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,020
Sometimes the same sentence, if the paragraph
is 1.

111
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,040
You use that to identify the paragraph.

112
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
It works very well.

113
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:34,380
If you are using that as identifier and you
build in something like, you measure the distance

114
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,670
between keys, you can end up with something
robust.

115
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,650
With that Url, you can throw in multiple different
keys with different variations.

116
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,650
I cannot pronounce this word.

117
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:47,640
Do you have it where you read a book with
a character that has a name, you say it inside

118
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
your head.

119
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,960
I have that going on here.

120
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,510
We use this function in Javascript to pretty
much match keys.

121
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,090
If you have a key off a paragraph and cut
off one of the sentences.

122
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,830
If you change anything in the middle.

123
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,060
It will still pair against the correct key.

124
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,120
You don't have to do anything on the backend.

125
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,240
You don't add overhead to the page.

126
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Unless it found something in the Url.

127
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
That's a recap.

128
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,790
The flow would be, if you hit the page you
provide a link with this key in it.

129
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,270
At that point, it inspects the page, generates
keys.

130
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,940
Looks for the match.

131
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,820
And do I match this or this and what is the
level of difference.

132
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,130
We can this for several hundred articles.

133
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,140
With 10-20 paragraphs.

134
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,050
We found 2 cases where there was a false positive.

135
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,100
An all the cases the first key was the correct
one.

136
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,060
You could extend this to images for example,
you want to restrict it to something.

137
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,480
This is the fun part.

138
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,210
I'm going to attempt a live demo.

139
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,210
And fall back to screenshots.

140
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,210
What we did to this.

141
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,400
There is a great article here.

142
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,100
The NY times did a wonderful redesign.

143
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,270
They cleared away everything and started from
scratch.

144
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,780
This is functionality that did not make it
back.

145
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,860
It was an oversight.

146
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,190
Someone is going to do it.

147
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,670
Until something gets done.

148
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,840
They have published the pages through the
redesign.

149
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,880
Technically it exists.

150
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,260
Let's see what happens.

151
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,650
This is an old article from 2012.

152
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,790
The idea was that one of the things, a quick
backstory.

153
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,560
My first job, I was doing customer service
for email.

154
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,060
One day we got 200-300 emails about an article.

155
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,440
You are so pro Palestine.

156
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,210
The other half was saying, you are so pro
Israel.

157
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,060
It was about the same article.

158
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,110
Context can matter.

159
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,240
If someone wants to tweet something, lies,
lies, lies, and provide a Url.

160
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,770
You are not going to read it.

161
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,620
If the person says, actually, on this paragraph,
this line, and here, these are the things

162
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,620
I'm disputing.

163
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,620
That are interesting.

164
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,620
That are interesting facts.

165
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,099
Whether it is a business based article.

166
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:41,300
You would share the link now and you wouldn't
have to give this long copy and paste.

167
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,810
You can use a keylike structure.

168
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,460
Not just for deep linking.

169
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,430
But in terms of highlighting or sharing or
annotation.

170
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,130
We did it at the time.

171
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,130
It was successful.

172
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,310
A power user feature not many people knew
about.

173
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,580
You have to double tap the shift key.

174
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,810
And even then, it was when it was used, used
for something interesting.

175
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,560
We would track how this was shared.

176
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,670
You can see people coming in.

177
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,670
We didn't set it up.

178
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,280
It is sad that it was gone.

179
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Anyhow, back to.

180
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,301
The ability that you can link to a paragraph.

181
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:09,410
You could also highlight content as well.

182
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,640
As you can see, these keys are not necessarily
readable.

183
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
That was one of the downsides.

184
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Depending of the level of granularity.

185
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
You can change the rules.

186
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
The first word.

187
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,600
The first words of each sentence.

188
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
That would take you on.

189
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
The screenshot I talked about.

190
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
More readable urls.

191
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,670
The first I recommend if you have long articles.

192
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,240
If you require more robust measures of tollerance.

193
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,300
As soon as you start changing, the Url or
text.

194
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,260
You need to include fuzziness if you look
it up.

195
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,530
This is my blog, I'm never going to change
that.

196
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,820
You can make that call.

197
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,670
We try to do something more specific.

198
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,550
Again, the examples are mostly text based.

199
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,550
How you would do it.

200
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,550
Link to interactive content.

201
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,750
Link to anything else you want to have on
a page.

202
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,750
I avoided that.

203
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,860
I can talk about that for hours.

204
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,860
But, readable text.

205
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,350
It is a robust solution.

206
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,562
If you need to deeplink quickly.

207
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:55,300
You can write it in 5-10 minutes.

208
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,380
The key generation is more robust.

209
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,670
To go to the other way.

210
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,540
After the times it worked well, it was solid,
people who used were happy.

211
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,700
We avoided the problem with integrating with
Cms.

212
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,630
It is a front end driven process.

213
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,290
You interact with it upon with a double shift
tap event.

214
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,060
You can have a button, add it.

215
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,340
It was loaded after the fact.

216
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,181
Likewise, there was a check to look at the
Url.

217
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:21,620
Is this person trying to deeplink.

218
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,870
If they weren't, no more code.

219
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,140
The process of generating keys for the article
and looking for matches.

220
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,910
We had a different problem to solve.

221
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,100
In hindside, I would go more towards the frontend.

222
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
An annotation system.

223
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,920
Not only to link to paragraphs.

224
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,170
But annotate it.

225
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,500
The original plan was to leverage social media.

226
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,080
By highlighting and annotating and tweeting
was the annotation.

227
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,870
We could pull it back.

228
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,870
The annotation is powerful.

229
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,250
Comments are a great way of readers to interact
with the author.

230
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,880
Comments can be a sestpool.

231
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,330
That's a terrible thing to say.

232
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,990
Unless you put in the editorials.

233
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,990
To properly maintain.

234
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,990
You are going to have problems.

235
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,130
They put in a lot of time of people to do
it.

236
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,130
They are strapped.

237
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,130
They have more writers.

238
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,490
So, with annotation plan was, if you get someone
to say, this article sucks, which is not helpful.

239
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,960
To let them go in and say, this paragraph
sucks.

240
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,950
That's actually a little step up for more
helpful information.

241
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,940
Maybe they will make specific reference.

242
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,620
They knew their comment was going to get lost.

243
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,960
We want to do that.

244
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:36,550
In turn people could annotate and tweet the
annotations.

245
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:46,330
And link back to the page.

246
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,330
It was there.

247
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,960
I'll quickly show you what it is.

248
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,240
And explain how we did it.

249
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,410
And what I would change.

250
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,740
Within a given article, you have the things
at the side.

251
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
You can link.

252
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,270
I don't work there anymore.

253
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,920
Within here, you can have these annotations.

254
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,830
Again, if you look at the source of the document.

255
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:10,220
It is creating a unique ID for every single
paragraph.

256
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,460
What they are doing that is different from
the times.

257
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,140
This is heavily tied into the backend system.

258
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,220
We used WordPress.

259
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,080
essentially, we do try to sync.

260
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,410
The difference in engineering required was
high.

261
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,930
In comparison when there was just me and another
person.

262
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,660
This took, I forgot how long it took.

263
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,660
It took...

264
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,660
Weeks.

265
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,660
Yes.

266
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Spread over months.

267
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,660
Other projects came in.

268
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
That we have to stop.

269
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,790
It took a long time.

270
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:42,610
And it is still one of those things where
annotations can get lost.

271
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,480
You have to go into the backend.

272
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,620
On Cms level as well.

273
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,710
You don't want the writers worrying about
matching keys up.

274
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,990
Or them getting the emails.

275
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,740
An annotation has been lost.

276
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,790
It did happen.

277
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,880
It was lessons learned.

278
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,860
We thought we could nail it.

279
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,860
You can.

280
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,290
At the level of effort and return.

281
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,230
You need to balance that.

282
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,910
One of the reasons why I bring this up.

283
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,820
There is a lot of other things to build on
top.

284
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Linking to paragraphs is straightforward.

285
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,640
Linking to content that can change.

286
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,410
And a system that is tolerant is helpful.

287
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,930
It can go the other way too.

288
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:36,590
Typically, if

289
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,530
you are a WordPress user or writer.

290
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,530
You have shortcodes.

291
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,530
We know the behavior of that.

292
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,530
To embed a Youtube video.

293
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,900
What if we can do that with articles?

294
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:49,470
I can build a WordPress article.

295
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,660
That would pull in the people.

296
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:04,060
What about embedding parts of the article.

297
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:14,110
I want to reference, cite, i want to have
that piece that I'm quoting in the before

298
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,360
and after paragraphs.

299
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:40,060
Building a service to do it

300
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,060
is straight forward.

301
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:47,970
How do you link it back to specific bits of
content.

302
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,530
Without iframing the entire article.

303
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,310
There are things that we could do to build.

304
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:03,990
I'd like to explore within the New Yorker.

305
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,740
But, it seems there is a lot of potential
still there.

306
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:34,860
The other thing in terms of services that

307
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:49,410
you 
can build on in

308
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,610
the page.

309
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:59,940
Main examples are linking, highlìghting and
annotation.

310
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:13,220
I'm sure there are

311
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,550
other things.

312
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:26,770
There are a lot of people here.

313
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:42,940
You are

314
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,230
very bright.

315
00:16:47,230 --> 00:17:08,960
I know there is some of the things you hear
ideas all the time.

316
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:22,270
And someone else will build on that.

317
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:33,309
I hope that happens.

318
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:50,690
There is 
a repo on github.

319
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,810
Project Emphasis.

320
00:17:55,810 --> 00:21:14,780
A

321
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,870
drag and drop.

322
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,760
Only dependency was J query.

323
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,710
It is no longer required.

324
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:28,600
More for the Css selectors.

325
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,670
You should dig into it.

326
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,410
And play around with it.

327
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,520
And see if it works for you.

328
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Thank you very much.
