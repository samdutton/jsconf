00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,990

thank you for having you here today I am

2
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,220
really excited about CSS Kampf so I have

3
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,500
always been kind of stuck in the middle

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,649
because I'm not a very good designer but

5
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:35,680
I love CSS and so I spent a lot of time

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,890
doing JavaScript in html5 but really

7
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,500
there's so much to be learned about CSS

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,930
and there's so very few places for

9
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,870
people like us to go to learn about it

10
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,430
to share what we've learned with each

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,589
other so I'm excited to be here today

12
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:55,420
I'm excited to be with all of you my

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,399
name is Jeff Burt oft and I work for

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,129
Microsoft I'm an html5 evangelist which

15
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:02,550
means I get to go around and talk with

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,770
developers about html5 and how they

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,869
implement it and how it works it with

18
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:10,590
Internet Explorer in Windows 8 apps and

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,330
today specifically I wanted to talk

20
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,030
about flexbox so I have kind of a

21
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,300
love-hate relationship with flexbox

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,369
which I'm guessing that many of you do

23
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:25,450
as well but I want to start out with

24
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,320
kind of a definition of flexbox and this

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,939
is the definition I pulled from this

26
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,990
back it's quite boring and dry and it

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,670
says the children will flex container

28
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,189
can be laid out in any direction and can

29
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:42,040
flex their sizes either growing to fill

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,860
unused space and shrinking to avoid and

31
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,469
you get the idea you're probably bored

32
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:47,979
already

33
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,039
I like to describe it as this it's

34
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:54,909
parental control so we have an element

35
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,759
that has children inside of it and we

36
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,280
define rules on that element and the

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,890
children follow those rules do I have

38
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,829
any parents in the room does anyone wish

39
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,840
that they could have CSS flexbox for

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,479
their kids I mean I wish I could get my

41
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,459
kids to act like I want them to and to

42
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,109
followed the rules instead they end up

43
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:15,970
acting like me and I can't figure out

44
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,850
what I'm doing wrong but with CSS

45
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,700
flexbox we have parental control so we

46
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,160
can define how we want each of the

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,760
children of an element to behave and if

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,440
you start to think about the power in

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,109
that you realize what there is to get

50
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:32,740
excited

51
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,150
with flexbox I can have an element that

52
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,280
just by changing some CSS properties

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,800
some flex properties on that element can

54
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,110
you control and change the behaviorist

55
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,360
of as children depending on the

56
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,820
circumstances so we often think about

57
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,860
this for media queries and how important

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,390
it is when we have different sizes of

59
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,240
screens or different device orientations

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,220
and we want to lay out our content

61
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,160
differently we can do that with Flex box

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,450
you know also think about localization

63
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,570
you know we often think about how we

64
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,170
read and we go from left to right on a

65
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,890
screen but there's different languages

66
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,750
that have completely different set of

67
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,350
rules on how they read text and flexbox

68
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,150
actually gives us the power to be able

69
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,400
to change based on what we know about

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,620
the person who's reading it so we have

71
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,380
parental control

72
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,170
now here comes a bad part so flexbox

73
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,440
does have a sordid history so I'm going

74
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,600
to take you all the way back to 2009 the

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,310
original flexbox spec was quite exciting

76
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,080
introduced and then by 2010 it was

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,670
already implemented in a number of

78
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,770
WebKit browsers myself I was

79
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,810
specifically excited about seeing it

80
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,240
inside of webOS it was one of the main

81
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,430
controls for laying out your apps in

82
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,430
webOS so as a webOS developer at the

83
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,670
time I got real excited and dug into it

84
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,850
and really learned how flexbox worked in

85
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,960
the how to get the power out of it and

86
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,500
then I woke up one day and it was gone

87
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,930
the flexbox spec was just canceled they

88
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,670
had decided that it wasn't working out

89
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,410
it wasn't going to be interoperable it

90
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,340
wasn't going to translate a

91
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,580
cross-browser as well and that actually

92
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,240
turned out to be a good thing because in

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,360
2011 a new modern spec was developed

94
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,520
which actually had more power gave you

95
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,970
more flexibility and was a lot easier to

96
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,910
use so we'll talk about why this is

97
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,070
important in a minute but then in 2012

98
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,160
ie10 implemented the spec as it was and

99
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,310
then the spec

100
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,520
changed a little bit more so mostly it

101
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,710
was syntax changes you know we the way

102
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,950
that we we state those properties but it

103
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,930
also added a few new key features so

104
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,150
that was good as well but as developers

105
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,640
what that leaves us with is with

106
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,130
different browsers supporting different

107
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,920
versions of this same spec so we have

108
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,570
some older browsers that support the

109
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,630
2009 spec IE 10 is supporting the

110
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,730
earlier implementation of the modern

111
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,270
spec and release candidate in browser

112
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,280
versions going forward are going to

113
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,160
release the support the final spec so it

114
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,190
can be difficult for us to utilize but

115
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,660
I'm hoping by the end of this to

116
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,870
encourage you all to want to use flexbox

117
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,270
in the future for your applications so

118
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,450
there's a lot of good there's a lot of

119
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,320
bad now to really demonstrate how

120
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,740
flexbox works I tried to figure out kind

121
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,110
of some of my favorite things that I can

122
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,990
use to put a demo together so I thought

123
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,480
I love the Brady Bunch

124
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,350
and I love the animated gifs so what

125
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,360
could go wrong right let's go to flexbox

126
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,760
demo out of that so before I show you

127
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,500
this demo I want to tell you I had a

128
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,300
really hard time finally finding the

129
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,080
models for this demo so I do think I

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,940
ended up with some pretty attractive

131
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,200
models and at Microsoft we do have you

132
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,260
know availability to these high quality

133
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,850
models that maybe not all companies do

134
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,320
but I'm gonna start out and play the

135
00:06:18,320 --> 00:07:18,130
demo for you

136
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,550
all right hopefully that's a little bit

137
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,540
more fun

138
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,790
a little bit more fun than just some

139
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,760
boring blocks on the screen now the key

140
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,280
to this is that I didn't change markup

141
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,190
for any of that I didn't change margins

142
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,140
I didn't change patents I didn't change

143
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,340
layouts the only thing that I changed

144
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,610
was flexbox properties and then display

145
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,000
so I could control which of those boxes

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,830
we're showing in which ones weren't so

147
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,210
just real quickly I'm going to show you

148
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,150
the code that went behind that it is

149
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:58,180
very simple

150
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,880
so all I had is a parent container which

151
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,940
is the screen area and then divs with

152
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,010
the animated gifts inside of them so

153
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,020
whenever we look at the CSS we're really

154
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,640
going to be looking at the CSS that we

155
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,410
apply to the screen area because

156
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,780
remember it is parental control that

157
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,180
we're looking at here so to start out

158
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,520
with mrs. braiding

159
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,510
what we actually did is let me stop for

160
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,580
a sec what I'm going to show you on the

161
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,560
the side of the screen here with the CSS

162
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,100
the top is going to be the MS prefix

163
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,080
that I'm using remember I talked about

164
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,120
the earlier version of the spec that was

165
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,039
implemented because that's what I use

166
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,410
for this demo writing ie ten and then

167
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,240
this bottom section is gonna be the

168
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,250
current spec okay so we're gonna kind of

169
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,380
focus on the current spec because that's

170
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,100
what ie

171
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,310
future versions of ie and browsers that

172
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,210
adopt flexbox in the future will use so

173
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,830
first of all we set the display property

174
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,840
to flex so that's how we know that we're

175
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,630
going to manage our children inside this

176
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,200
elem element as flex elements we then

177
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,490
are going to decide whether we're gonna

178
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,310
set it as a row or a column so we can

179
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,920
have our elements fall in a row which

180
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,030
means they're going to go from left to

181
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,740
right or in a column where they're gonna

182
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,900
go to top to bottom we also are going to

183
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,220
have the option to reverse that and

184
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,300
we'll show that in a minute

185
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,370
and then we're gonna decide that it's

186
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,400
gonna wrap or not wrap so what we've

187
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,710
done with Mrs Brady we've actually set a

188
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,190
justify to be the end which is basically

189
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,130
going to kind of cram all of the content

190
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,160
into the end of the Flex box so in this

191
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,200
case it keeps her on the right side of

192
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,960
the screen and also we're going to add

193
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,330
an alignment or to keep her centered so

194
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,590
we're going to keep her centered into

195
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,510
the light the right and so we apply that

196
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,760
to the parent element and it applies

197
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,650
those controls to the child next when we

198
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,560
add in the girls we have four boxes on

199
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,300
the screens that are different sizes and

200
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,010
it's important to remember that since

201
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,540
we're managing the parent not the

202
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,270
children it can be any element they can

203
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,340
be all divs that can be divs in images

204
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,400
they can be a mixture of whatever and

205
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,440
for this we have again our display set

206
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,060
to flex and then we're putting them in

207
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,050
columns because we

208
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,779
go from top to bottom and then we're

209
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,880
gonna center align it so it'll naturally

210
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,740
flow from one column to the next and

211
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,720
everyone will be centered aligned and

212
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,480
have equal spacing around each side so

213
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,880
when we introduce mr. Brady again we

214
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,250
have them set in a column and have him

215
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,010
centered but we have the justify set to

216
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,589
flex start so instead of kind of

217
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:39,200
bunching the elements to the end like we

218
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,500
had with a flex end for the justify work

219
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,540
on a bunch into the beginning and that's

220
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,750
gonna be the Flex start now adding the

221
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,220
boys was actually a little bit tricky

222
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,610
because what we wanted to do here is we

223
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,269
wanted to have one element in a column

224
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:59,690
of its own and then the other elements

225
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,860
in their own column so to do this we had

226
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,490
to add some additional CSS to each of

227
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,390
the child elements otherwise if we

228
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,880
applied it as the CSS is on the screen

229
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,089
now Peter or excuse me Greg the guy at

230
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:20,149
the top would be under mr. Brady because

231
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,370
he would want to flow in that column and

232
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,850
he wouldn't wrap onto the next column so

233
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,060
we added an element - or excuse me a

234
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,380
rule to mr. Brady where his order is a

235
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,839
different number than the rest of the

236
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,990
boys so we set him to be order of one

237
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,050
and by default all the boys are order of

238
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,360
zero which puts them into two different

239
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,970
groups so I talked about how powerful

240
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,490
flexbox is you can actually change the

241
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,680
order of your elements even though they

242
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,459
may be in a maybe out of a natural order

243
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:57,890
that they are in the Dom so in this case

244
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,510
we're going to group them by setting the

245
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,820
orders to one and zero and that means

246
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,529
that the groups are going to flow

247
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:06,320
together which makes mr. Brady in his

248
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,690
own column and all the boys flow

249
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:15,110
together in the second column now

250
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,360
centering is actually something that's

251
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,730
been difficult for us in CSS and

252
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,800
everything that we've done to try to get

253
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,000
something to Center on the

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,980
Paige has always been in my mind

255
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,950
borderline hackish to get it going but

256
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,230
flexbox actually has built into the spec

257
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,630
the ability to be able to Center

258
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,430
something top to bottom left to right

259
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,010
and in this case we want one column

260
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,770
centered in the middle of the screen

261
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,260
with Mrs Brady and mr. Brady together so

262
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,350
we have the Flex flow set to column the

263
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,780
alignment centered and then the space

264
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,060
the justified of the content to be

265
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,590
spaced around which just means it's

266
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,810
going to have equal space on both sides

267
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,730
so left and right is going to be the

268
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,100
same which puts it in the center of the

269
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:04,760
screen so whenever we add all of the

270
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,160
boxes on the screen together we're using

271
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,930
a wrap for the columns so it's going to

272
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,250
have three different columns on the

273
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,140
screen and they're all going to be

274
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,670
centered which is going to give them an

275
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,910
equal amount of spacing in between and

276
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,410
it's going to go from the first column

277
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,550
wrap to the second and wrap to the third

278
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,960
now when we think about outside of our

279
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,180
brady boxes the way that we can

280
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,730
implement this in real life we really

281
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,220
have some flexibility now what I have

282
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,770
here is the Bing sports app this is a

283
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,780
Windows 8 application that's written in

284
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,720
html5 and JavaScript okay that's one of

285
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,790
our platforms and while we're hearing

286
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,980
from our developers is that there's

287
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,100
actually more control and more

288
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,630
flexibility that they have when they use

289
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,300
CSS for their layout then when they use

290
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,450
manage code like sam'l so CSS is

291
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,060
actually producing more flexibility for

292
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,750
developers so our apps are Bing apps the

293
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:10,070
sports app our news app finance are all

294
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,740
written in HTML and use CSS for styling

295
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,280
and this is a beautiful edge to edge

296
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,800
layout that utilizes flexbox and

297
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,470
utilizes grids in a lot of new CSS

298
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,810
layout technologies to make these

299
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,900
beautiful pages and they're flexible as

300
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,960
well so here we have columns with fonts

301
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,230
and texts that are different and inter

302
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,649
woven pictures with the articles out

303
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:40,730
with CSS so flexbox is also great

304
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,649
because when you change the size of the

305
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,689
screen you can use your media queries to

306
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:46,999
determine how you want the layout to

307
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:49,040
change so if you have it in a wide

308
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,199
column it may look one way if you have

309
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,189
it in a full-screen it may look another

310
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:58,759
so point up one more example here so

311
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,619
mixing flex with media queries gives us

312
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:06,980
a lot of flexibility to change without

313
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,889
making any CSS alterations to those

314
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,990
elements so depending on the width of

315
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,110
the the screen here I choose the

316
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,550
direction of the layout whether it's

317
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,439
being from left to right or up to down

318
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:21,800
and also the order so I can set it to go

319
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:29,689
forward or reverse of that content so

320
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:33,920
the CSS flexbox still can be confusing

321
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,529
it can still be a lot to swallow and I'm

322
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:37,999
sure that you're not all going to be

323
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:40,100
flexbox experts from watching a few

324
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,170
minutes of a presentation here but I

325
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,540
hope what you do take away is that

326
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,189
there's power in this we have a lot of

327
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:50,809
control over how our page is going to

328
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,360
are going to layout and how each of our

329
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,389
users are going to see the content that

330
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,589
we want to provide for them

331
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,720
so I have a few resources here I'll make

332
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,519
sure that at the end I tweet out these

333
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,189
resources some of these are from Chris

334
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:06,019
Mills over at opera he's done a really

335
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:08,629
great job of explaining how to use

336
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,879
flexbox in today's world if you want to

337
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,189
support the legacy versions along with

338
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,620
the modern versions and then the

339
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,779
Microsoft implementation and of course

340
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:23,269
the the spec itself from the w3c so

341
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:25,879
that's the content I had for today I

342
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:29,420
hope that you walk away wanting to

343
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,490
implement flexbox in your applications

344
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,119
as well so question so I have a few

345
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,869
minutes for questions yes so the

346
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:40,549
question was are there any performance

347
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,089
concerns that you have to be considered

348
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,990
considerate of whenever you're using

349
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,299
flexbox so flexbox

350
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,220
being natively controlled

351
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,750
is actually going to perform very well

352
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,420
across browsers so if you are using

353
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,060
currently heavily nested CSS or even

354
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,000
JavaScript to control some your layouts

355
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,460
CSS in almost every case the Flex box is

356
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,410
going to perform better now it is

357
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,450
important to keep in mind that there is

358
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,900
not full support it's it's a this is a

359
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,910
fairly new spec that's been introduced

360
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,700
and being adopted so when you do use it

361
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,070
in a web environment you need to be

362
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,080
concerned about your legacy browsers and

363
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,200
either using polyfills or falling back

364
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,060
to a different layout for browsers that

365
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,280
don't support it yes so regions is a

366
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,890
great companion with flexbox the

367
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,590
question was have we used have we tried

368
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,250
adobe regions with the Flex box and a

369
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,070
lot of the layouts that I showed inside

370
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,840
of the Bing apps are using regions that

371
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
allow your content to flow from one

372
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,920
container to another so it gives you the

373
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,250
ability to be able to layout use the

374
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,410
high-level elements using flexbox and

375
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,560
then let regions control how much text

376
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,740
ends up in each of those boxes so it

377
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,270
becomes a very natural companion

378
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,610
together whenever you're trying to do

379
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,890
some creative layouts with text using

380
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,640
flexbox with regions again gives you a

381
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,500
lot of control over your content so the

382
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,750
question is whenever you change the

383
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,930
order of elements with CSS than they are

384
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,460
in the Dom are there accessibility

385
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,640
concerns I would say there are

386
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,220
accessibility opportunities because a

387
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,420
lot of times you layout your HTML in a

388
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,760
way that may be natural for markup and

389
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,130
generally natural for a screen reader

390
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,800
but if you want it to appear different

391
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,430
for the visual needs that you have then

392
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,440
you introduce flex box to change the

393
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,610
layout for that so if you are going to

394
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,060
if you're going to use flex box to

395
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,100
change the order of your Dom instead of

396
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,419
changing it you know in your markup

397
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,409
guess if you're doing it because you're

398
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,269
lazy then yes you need to be concerned

399
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,489
for accessibility but if you're doing it

400
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:09,259
because you actually need a difference

401
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:11,059
between what is being presented on the

402
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,789
page and what the visual users are

403
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:16,309
seeing then it's actually an opportunity
