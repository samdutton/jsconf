58
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:01,670

nuts eps level 2

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,140
you got it okay thank you alright so

65
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,739
let's go so yeah not one part 1 we will

66
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,680
start with some music and what is music

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,440
you can say the most simple explanation

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,780
is that music is organized sound and

69
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,680
this sound can come from everything like

70
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,230
a voice or an instrument like the guitar

71
00:03:51,230 --> 00:04:06,440
or created digitally and Archer if you

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,019
have the sound and you create music it's

73
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:14,659
called a sample if you use the music for

74
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:18,470
something else and so what is the sample

75
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,019
a sample simply some part of the music

76
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,240
that is record and you can use it so

77
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,110
example is recorded sound and you can

78
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,310
get a sample from everything like your

79
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,010
little puppy that's playing a saxophone

80
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,000
and you can record this if you like or

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,580
if you eat some flies of pizza and the

82
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,270
sound of you chewing it I'm gap that

83
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,300
might be awesome too awesome view that

84
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,699
surfing exploding volcano in his

85
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:52,340
streaming hahaha what happen would be a

86
00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:00,470
nice sound too so yeah let's come to the

87
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,120
first demo we will use a microphone to

88
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,690
record a sample and this is the

89
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:15,620
microphone and i will switch to my the

90
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,510

101
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,580

126
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,780
in mind Martin didn't you tell me you

127
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,940
beatbox when you were younger don't you

128
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,700

129
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:12,010
would be nice okay just do your thing

130
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:32,800
Martin please Thank You Martin so what

131
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,150
you see on the screen is my very fancy

132
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,510
microphone recording demo and what it

133
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,060
does is when you push the record button

134
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,720
and the media stream API is used to

135
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,410
fetch the odd user input stream and when

136
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,480
I push the record button again it stops

137
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,540
and create some blog and you can

138
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,180
download this blob as a WAV file and I

139
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,640
also create an audio element here so I

140
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,810
can replay it oh I will do this and I

141
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,300
can also download it and specify a name

142
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,620
and whatever sound what there was and if

143
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,560
I download I can download the wav file

144
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,910
and this is all happening in the browser

145
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,930
which is super awesome you should

146
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:29,070
applause me please welcome to the class

147
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:37,460
so the next demo to create a sample you

148
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:45,740
can also use the Web Audio API Oh what's

149
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,800
happening m in combination with a midi

150
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,580
controller to create sounds

151
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,910
programmatically and this is my awesome

152
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,730
synthesizer demo which looks completely

153
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,650
different and what's the design tag

154
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,670
super fancy thank you and what's

155
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,700
happening here is when I push the midi

156
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,040
controller i show it to you one month 12

157
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,240
x 11 second please why is it so ok no no

158
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,090
problem if i push your money this short

159
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:39,740
no it's because I hand push Alhassan so

160
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,170
what is Tim doing on stage you can't see

161
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,090
it right I push something but you comes

162
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:50,570
here is it as shitty so I have a webcam

163
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,480
here and what I have here is a midi

164
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,170
controller that is connected over USB to

165
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,370
my pc and because we have the web MIDI

166
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,930
API I can control any mini controller

167
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,620
with my browser and when I open the

168
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,970
console you can see my awesome debug

169
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:20,750
lock and when I push a key it sends some

170
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,270
kind of events to the browser which I

171
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,180
can listen to and like like mouse down

172
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,880
and now as a puppy down and here exactly

173
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,390
exactly like this and you can push the

174
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,220
keys and create some sound in this case

175
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,840
i'm using the Web Audio API in

176
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,330
combination with to obsess laterz to

177
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,730
create sound

178
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,610
I'm going to push another key you can

179
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:49,120
see that every key has a unique note so

180
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,209
I can trigger different sounds based on

181
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:56,230
every key which is awesome and of course

182
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,920
I have some canvas in the background to

183
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,500
create a zone but this yeah just for fun

184
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,850
and we could record this but i will show

185
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:22,310
you something later so the book

186
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,580
we have some samples now and what should

187
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,890
we do with the samples there is an

188
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,610
awesome desktop app based on electron

189
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,710
that's called loop drop and Luke drop is

190
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,230
created by Matt macaque and you can use

191
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,120
it to create electronic music life and

192
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,280
it's open source and you can find it on

193
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,610
Luke GS com and I will show it to you

194
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,580
now because I can't program stuff like

195
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:05,140
this myself and this is Luke drop and

196
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,690
what you see here is on the left side

197
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,090
you can create setups and those setups

198
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,750
you create you can create groups of

199
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:21,450
sounds or samples and I'm removing my

200
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:29,230
awesome piano to show you something else

201
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,600
yeah I'm sorry but it will be happening

202
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,510
any second

203
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:45,680
so what I have here is what can now no

204
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:55,640
that's not what I want so now I am I

205
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,670
have another midi controller as it's

206
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:04,640
also connected over USB and you can see

207
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,790
here I have some samples already in my

208
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,670
set and if i push a button like on the

209
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,450
on the piano i can create a sound for

210
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:29,090
example like this one ooh alright so and

211
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,780
now I will take my time to you get all

212
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,060
your samples and put it into your crop

213
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,880
but I will do this in the background and

214
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:51,270
now it's Martin Stern all right then Oh

215
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,379
keep all the still connect up

216
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:02,269
see oh this works well alright so my

217
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,389
part was the light show and the first

218
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:08,209
thing i did this at james caan for you

219
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:12,549
last year um for the first time and I

220
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:17,209
kind of extended on the idea but who few

221
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,779
walls at jazz comfy you last year are

222
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:24,249
not so many though for the rest of you

223
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:26,899
just a quick and true what professional

224
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,829
lighting is so um there is this one

225
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:35,019
protocol named dmx512 and it's a

226
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,759
actually it's the only protocol that is

227
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,039
used to control professional stage

228
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,649
lighting and basically every piece of

229
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:49,249
stage equipment what sorry we don't want

230
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:55,659
you to event you okay um so DMX

231
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:59,839
specifies just 512 channels hence the

232
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,629
name and each of those channels is just

233
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:07,759
a single bite then you have DMX devices

234
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,939
which can be simple simple floodlights

235
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:15,229
or even more advanced kind of lighting

236
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:18,470
equipment and they can use up to any

237
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:24,299
number of channel to say oh sorry whoo

238
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:26,990
hello ray

239
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,279
that's what that was offensive sorry

240
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:38,820
sorry really sorry okay um so each of

241
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,940
the issue is just these diseases can be

242
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,370
independently address and has a couple

243
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,500
number of channels for all sorts of

244
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,430
different functions like the color or

245
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,690
yeah you will see you can of course by

246
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,630
such DMX USB interface but those are

247
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,029
tend to be a really expensive so I built

248
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,040
one my own out of a food container an

249
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,260
Arduino and some custom electronics that

250
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,420
the only cost 10 0 so really a the cheap

251
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,959
way to go it's a live and it works quite

252
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,120
well so and having our we know which

253
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,750
talks over serial port guy use beef I

254
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,520
can simply do this so i have a unsigned

255
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,809
byte array 512 bytes long and if I now

256
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,050
write that byte array to a serial port

257
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,900
that will get sent out as a DMX signal

258
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,280
to all the devices here in the room so

259
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,260
um manipulating such a byte array is

260
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,540
painful because DMX is a really weird

261
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,140
protocol you can can't really keep track

262
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,780
of what each of these channels does and

263
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,960
what the values mean so I started to

264
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,050
write interface for that I called 512

265
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:11,309
which simply lets me use all this DMX

266
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:13,440
stuff simply by setting properties on

267
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,820
objects so while writing that i found

268
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,280
out that objectifying property is really

269
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:28,800
my friend but before I explain how opens

270
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,710
works just moving to this demo here so

271
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,790
um what

272
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:38,040
see maybe a zoom boot yeah like this so

273
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,890
what you see here is one of those

274
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,080
so-called moving hat spotlight so

275
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,270
there's in the middle here it's a

276
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,050
regular spotlight but fancy one but

277
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,180
basically just just lamp and it's

278
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,130
mounted within that bracket and the

279
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,280
bracket is mounted on that base and it

280
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,130
has cell to degrees of freedom and I can

281
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,060
control them like this so i can adjust a

282
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,630
tilt angle which is a rotation around

283
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,730
the x-axis and then there's the rotation

284
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,920
around the z axis which is called pan

285
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,210
and so this is this is how such a spot

286
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,970
like an basically move freely around so

287
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,690
now I'm this 512 library I've wrote is

288
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,450
written in JavaScript and so it becomes

289
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,060
really easy to just put it in a browser

290
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,400
and open the web socket the WebSocket

291
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,260
talks to server the server talk to the

292
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,350
DMX interface sends out 512 bytes of

293
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,280
data so then I'll just open this console

294
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,140
here maybe quick reload just see it says

295
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,880
hi it's nice so I can interact with my

296
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,800
or maybe I should increase the font size

297
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,480
good the bezel yeah all right so yes

298
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,150
there's this one object I named device

299
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,450
registry and this gives me access to all

300
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,570
the devices in a summer meaningful way

301
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,460
and I can now go ahead and select some

302
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,260
devices in this case I assigned to

303
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,440
variable name p and I want all the dot

304
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,240
profile so um what does this is it

305
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,250
selects all all the devices that I name

306
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,010
to profile from the selection of devices

307
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,070
in this room and you can see those are

308
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,860
four of them and they are hanging right

309
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,450
up there the four lamps so um I can now

310
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,049
assign some values for

311
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:45,169
pan and tools for instance so by moving

312
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:48,619
into position but in order in order to

313
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:52,970
light them up there are two things about

314
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,149
these lands I have to open the shutter

315
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:58,999
which shuts the beam off and Bess turn

316
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:01,970
the light so additionally to the shutter

317
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:08,590
they also have a dimmer and so buses now

318
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,529
and really it's just a assignment of

319
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:15,499
object property and I can just adjust

320
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:16,909
the brightness a bit for you in the

321
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:21,549
middle or maybe I can adjust the color

322
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:28,999
so back to full brightness a new a new

323
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:32,299
thing accepts actually everything that

324
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,239
will CSS classification allows at

325
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:37,279
California's because those devices have

326
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:44,179
a 48-bit color mixing unit so what else

327
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,940
yeah of course um i would like to

328
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,340
animate them now but the problem is i

329
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,309
can type so fast just the panel values

330
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:55,999
so now we have it on the browser right

331
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,649
on the browser has a lot of awesome

332
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:02,019
stuff for instance the gamepad api so um

333
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:06,080
graph here this is a this is actually a

334
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,289
3d mouse a cold space navigator and it

335
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,419
connects to the browser via the gamepad

336
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:17,629
api showing 6 axis of freedom whether

337
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:20,119
that i can adjust and i have rope some

338
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,519
adapter for those this is called space

339
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:25,700
enough pan tilt controls and i can now

340
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,489
just put the moving hats in there and

341
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:34,480
hopefully is now I'm able to

342
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,160
just play around with them like this

343
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,640
maybe not so much in the audience more

344
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,790
to the stage all right Tim how you're

345
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,120
doing the samples are awesome i don't

346
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,180
know what i'm doing i try to fix them

347
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,170
somehow but yeah it's the one guy would

348
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,520
shout that you have a script at the

349
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,230
wrong time thank you it's ruined

350
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:06,950
everything but ok so this is all this

351
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,680
all really really great and I could I

352
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,050
could just really go ahead and program

353
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,620
animations with these lamps and do all

354
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,660
kinds of awesome stuff with them but i

355
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,390
would have to write javascript and what

356
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,810
about maybe if i want to do a light show

357
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,420
I I would need to have a lot of

358
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,520
different settings and I would need to

359
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,880
be able to combine them like different

360
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,100
colors and different positions should be

361
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,800
you should be able to manage

362
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,360
independently maybe I want something

363
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,710
like inheritance and yeah I actually

364
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,010
started trying to do this was with a big

365
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:53,270
Jason fire but yeah turns out using CSS

366
00:23:53,270 --> 00:24:01,460
as a way better way to us oh oh oh wait

367
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:08,600
I'm sorry

368
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,480
sorry

369
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,850
okay so this is what I ended up with

370
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,280
because all these all these object

371
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,530
properties that are already had can now

372
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,200
be simply something written a CSS

373
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,289
properties and I have the selection of

374
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:28,470
devices which is upfront so i can I can

375
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,929
just do the same that I just do it with

376
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,000
open the shutter and set a color and set

377
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,460
the brightness panel tool values and

378
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,450
write this and CSS so um and this

379
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,840
actually is something that does work I

380
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,559
just need to this is a serial port

381
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,070
communicating so what do i need to do i

382
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,799
need to start next demo here okay it's

383
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,140
doing something let's see if it's the

384
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,590
right thing so this thing has a

385
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:08,529
presentation mode right where is it ah

386
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:14,520
does it doesn't matter um I will just do

387
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,450
it like this okay so um what you're

388
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,520
seeing here is a CSS file that was

389
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,080
currently running in the room and just

390
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,480
to prove this I actually implemented

391
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,990
live reload um follow so i can now

392
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:42,430
adjust this what no like this

393
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,620
or maybe a bit more JavaScript of color

394
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,390
here or do some uneven on any way we can

395
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:58,460
be we can put a color here whose ok so

396
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,429
all of this is working but yeah I'm the

397
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:05,010
thing else I didn't actually do this

398
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:10,620
just for fun so um this is what I

399
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,409
actually did so i have to some i'm

400
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:17,039
writing zas photos so i have to use

401
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,950
notes as to produce some CSS that i can

402
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,039
further use I used to rework passer to

403
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,580
take that fierce as a part and so I have

404
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,990
that AST and I then just implemented

405
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,750
this aquarium get computed style for the

406
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,799
room which based on what I what I set as

407
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:41,820
styles yeah but creates all the

408
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,280
properties for every device and send

409
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,000
some out over my DMX interface and the

410
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,330
next thing I'm going to show you is why

411
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,799
I did this because i also have such a

412
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,919
large pad here now just quickly need to

413
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,630
stop that demo and what was the launch

414
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:09,140
pad yeah makes sense this is not good

415
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,590
but I know um just not plugging us

416
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,780
beyond this a bad idea if you want to ah

417
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:22,630
there it is awesome let's stop this okay

418
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,580
all devices initialized and now you can

419
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,010
see I have this to come with you uh oh

420
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:35,610
no matter so I can just push some

421
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,320

422
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,500
the whole on button then they have

423
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,809
buttons that control where the lights

424
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:47,100
are pointing and I have buttons for

425
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,200
color presets like pure

426
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,470
yellow or stuff like that and a lot of

427
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,650
