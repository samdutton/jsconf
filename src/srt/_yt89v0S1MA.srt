00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,390

[Music]

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,859
I'll raise rock

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,360
oh I don't hear it

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,960
I'm ready to rock okay so let's go

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:33,150
[Music]

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:50,750


7
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:50,760
[Music]

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,420
so yeah every city occurred voice

9
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,269
precedes by JavaScript and actually Web

10
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:01,870
Audio stuff so before I go and deep how

11
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,159
to make it I just introduced myself so

12
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,710
my name is Vitaly I'm Ukrainian who

13
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,750
lives and working in Poland nice city

14
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,700
called broad Slav I'm working for a

15
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,680
company called open systems

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,930
I'm Corgan izing and go abroad Slav

17
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,229
meetups here and yeah I have a hobby to

18
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:22,780
play a geezer time to time and to relax

19
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,539
you can follow me on Twitter this is my

20
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:31,860
handle and my personal blog so web audio

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,080
what is that how we can use it actually

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,250
Web Audio is a uni directed graph that

23
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,909
contain out there notes so what is

24
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,300
actually uni directed graph it's a bunch

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,810
of dots connected with some directed

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,869
arrows basically we have some input or

27
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:59,229
source of our sound and we have an

28
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,410
output between source and output we have

29
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,920
some nulls that's going to add some

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,099
effects processor audio our audio

31
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:13,840
analyse it whatever and we have the same

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,890
four meter stack we have an input our

33
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,370
instrument and we have output speakers

34
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,300
or some stack of speakers and between

35
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,470
those we have some effects amplifiers

36
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,550
cabinets distortions OverDrive's all the

37
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,599
stuff so first of all how we can connect

38
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,319
our Geezer to Web Audio to do that we

39
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,450
need first of all create an audio

40
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,930
context so we create in our audio

41
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,200
context and is the main point where we

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,340
operate in audio graph then very

43
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,770
question is in

44
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,000
idea using navigator media devices and

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,040
if you want to use only audio video

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,010
question audio that's easy yeah but it

47
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,970
won't be that easy so wait for a moment

48
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,580
to use an instrument as a stream as I

49
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,880
said be requesting audio true getting

50
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,060
user media but to clean up our sound we

51
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,570
need to use some constraints because by

52
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,330
default browsers apply an echo

53
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,920
cancellation noise suspension after gain

54
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,980
control and some latency to our input so

55
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,370
to have the clean input we need to use

56
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,350
those constraints and this is last step

57
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,370
we creating a media stream source that's

58
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,700
the stream that goes through our inputs

59
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,810
audio card and then we connect in our

60
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,020
source with context destinations that

61
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,500
our speakers or another destinations

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,160
that we can choose in our system so when

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,200
we connect something we want to control

64
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,820
the volume how loud it is how to do so

65
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,020
we have a special mode gain node and we

66
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,840
can imagine our sound wave as a sign and

67
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,020
if we divided by 2 or multiply by 0 5 we

68
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,350
will get the smaller sine wave and the

69
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,480
amplitude of this sine wave actually

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,710
means our volume how loud our sound so

71
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,960
to reduce sound we need to divide by 2

72
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,650
to increase sound we need to multiply by

73
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,110
some number so house looks in cold

74
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,690
recreational gain node using constructor

75
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,040
or factory method on context and after

76
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,290
that we can apply value we use gain node

77
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,670
gain where

78
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,740
you and set up zero will mean our sound

79
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,180
will be muted one is it's normal and if

80
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,820
it's higher than 1 it will be louder

81
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,990
than original input next we need to

82
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,510
build this graph so we have our source

83
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,210
then we connected to gain node to

84
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,920
control volume and connect again to

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,590
destination so let's try it how it looks

86
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:49,530
like okay let's do that

87
00:05:49,530 --> 00:06:03,330
not it's not visible okay let's desert

88
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:11,029
[Applause]

89
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:26,000
okay oh that's better and

90
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,450
okay

91
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,570
now it's better

92
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,190
so yeah I have an application and I have

93
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,230
connected source here and we got this

94
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,560
green sound

95
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:51,520
[Music]

96
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,320
and I have a volume control so I can

97
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:02,670
make it not the cloud

98
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,500
[Music]

99
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,870
so yeah it was the basic stuff actually

100
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,449
as this manager I wrote myself some time

101
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:23,240
ago so okay the first effect I want to

102
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,449
show is this social so you can't imagine

103
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,879
any rock music without distortion sound

104
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,810
and basically what is this ocean it's a

105
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,629
group of effects that shaping our way

106
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:40,159
input sound with some function so what

107
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,530
is this group of effects we have few of

108
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,590
them overdrive distortion and fools and

109
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,000
all of them still called fools I want to

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,520
tell sorry how it was invented so in the

111
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,150
past the amplifiers wasn't that good as

112
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,400
they are now and they were broken

113
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,449
sometime so who if speaker was broken is

114
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:10,849
that to produce disordered sound so some

115
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:14,000
people started to distil destroy their

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,430
amplifiers themselves to get this sound

117
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,340
before it was done by some transitions

118
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,880
and so on now you don't need to do that

119
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,430
you can just use Web Audio for that yeah

120
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,680
don't destroy speakers so how its look

121
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,570
like again we have any input that's

122
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,409
actually a say a sine wave yes and we

123
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,200
apply some function to it to make it

124
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,790
more square so this mu squared sound

125
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,240
gives out our sound to be disordered for

126
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,310
example we can apply that function that

127
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,860
is here but what's the difference

128
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,209
between overdrive distortion and food so

129
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:02,060
the difference is how smooth is that

130
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,370
curve overdrive is usually something

131
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,270
lamp based so it's more smooth curve

132
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,100
distortions have some more harder one

133
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,440
and fools basically sounds like

134
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,520
something ditional it's almost flat sine

135
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,110
wave

136
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,510
so to shape our input in way we want it

137
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,810
we can use wave shape or node we can

138
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,430
create in and apply a curve and curve is

139
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,400
a floating 32-bit array containing

140
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,040
numbers that will be applied by Web

141
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,520
Audio and reshape our sound so we

142
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,630
creating some array we loop sweet and to

143
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,450
plan our function then that function

144
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,290
will be Bill rebased on our input to

145
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,270
achieve the desired sound also we want

146
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,990
to control tone or even create some

147
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,230
equation for our effect to create simple

148
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,110
tone control we can use big wide filter

149
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,260
node this type of flow paths low-pass

150
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,860
big glass filter means that everything's

151
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,270
everything that goes down to some

152
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,450
particle frequency will be cut off from

153
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,020
our sound so controlling this frequency

154
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,330
of this filter from lower 350 to highest

155
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,270
we control it if our sound will be

156
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:45,550
higher or lower west right

157
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,779
so I have a bunch of distortions here so

158
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:57,410
now we have a clean sound yeah and let's

159
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,400
try some overdrive

160
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:08,250
[Music]

161
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,930
and let's try to use some tone we can

162
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,380
make it darker

163
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:29,940
and white sir

164
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,430
this kind of classic overdrive let's

165
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,480
make some some crunch

166
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,890
[Music]

167
00:11:41,900 --> 00:12:02,250


168
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:16,280
[Music]

169
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,110
okay let's switch to some distortion

170
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,640
more heavy sounds

171
00:12:21,640 --> 00:13:08,850
[Music]

172
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,410
okay I have something more heavy it's

173
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,500
quite noisy but it sounds like something

174
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,870
matter

175
00:13:16,870 --> 00:14:00,400
[Music]

176
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,080
yeah that sounds really nice but it

177
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,290
still sounds digitally so to make it

178
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,800
more realistic we need to simulate

179
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,770
cabinets or amplifiers so to simulate

180
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,960
amplifiers we can use something called

181
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,650
impulse response so it's a short sample

182
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,540
really just a second or even less that

183
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,300
captures the impulse response from some

184
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,610
real device

185
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,230
imagine this impulse response like a

186
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,050
photograph of the sound so like

187
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:41,850
photograph is taking a snapshot of some

188
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,300
light at some moment the same with

189
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,670
impulse response we have a snapshot of

190
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,900
something in real life so how to apply

191
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,730
it in Web Audio we can use special mode

192
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,250
can go over node and it's actually

193
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,910
really awesome because that node hides a

194
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:07,110
lot of complexity it gets this impulse

195
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,880
response for you and applies it via fast

196
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,760
Fourier transformations so all heavy

197
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,370
work was done for you by controller node

198
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,670
so you just fashioned an impulse

199
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,300
response then converting it to array

200
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,450
buffer then this array buffers need to

201
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,720
be decoded by audio context and applied

202
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,090
as a buffer for controller also usual

203
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,910
amplifiers has equalization at least

204
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,770
romantic visor so we also want to do it

205
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,500
so what is sexual is romantic reviser we

206
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,270
have bus is everything that goes behind

207
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,030
500 we have me do that takes from five

208
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,590
hundred to three thousand and treble

209
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,020
that takes everything highest and three

210
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,210
thousand gates

211
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,510
and we have special notes for that in

212
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,690
Web Audio we can again use big fat

213
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,420
filter loud but different types of

214
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,260
filters now so region wall shelf what

215
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,110
does it mean it takes everything that is

216
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,120
above the frequency and cut its off

217
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,720
beacon is take the nearest range from

218
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,770
the provided frequency and amplifies it

219
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:36,470
high shelf it takes everything that

220
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,100
above some frequency and amplifies and

221
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,160
cut off everything behind below this

222
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:54,720
frequency let's read

223
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:01,300
okay so I have is the faucets also kind

224
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,550
of crunchy amplifier we can turn it off

225
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:25,690
it's clean so it sounds more realistic

226
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,930
and we can apply different impulse

227
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,870
responses to get different kinds of

228
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:42,210
amplifiers simulators and first-rate

229
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,970
musical Iser who has cut off all middle

230
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:53,210
frequencies

231
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,280
[Music]

232
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:10,630
or increase them with treble

233
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,630
[Music]

234
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,990
okay let's reset it right now and try

235
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,860
distortion without amplifier first

236
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:39,909
[Music]

237
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:44,330
let's apply our controller notes right

238
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,110
now

239
00:18:46,110 --> 00:19:17,490
[Music]

240
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:28,279


241
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:38,840
so it's make our sound more realistic

242
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,080
yeah and the icing usually when some

243
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,269
company doing sound record in they

244
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,059
applied ifficult reverberation to add

245
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:51,929
some volume to the record room so

246
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,409
basically we usually to hear some sounds

247
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:58,990
more realistic we imagined it in some

248
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,009
space in room or Hall or something else

249
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:07,809
so how to do this whether it's more

250
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:10,509
complicated effect to implement so

251
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,419
basically we want to split our input

252
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:16,929
into few two channels just what will be

253
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:19,450
clean Channel and untouched completely

254
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,929
we will mix it with the modified stream

255
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,659
merging it again at the end and on the

256
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:32,200
second stream we want to slightly g'way

257
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,620
our sound to express the times that gets

258
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,559
for the sound to go to the walls and

259
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:46,539
come back to you so it's trying to do

260
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:48,909
the same thing that in real world then

261
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:51,519
we apply some the tone control this big

262
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,850
fat filter and apply special impulse

263
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,700
response you can not only have impulse

264
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,279
responses for amplifiers you can have it

265
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:03,370
for some spaces right rooms or concert

266
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,500
halls holes or theaters so then we get

267
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,799
in this chain and merging it back to one

268
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:16,120
stream and we can switch how many the

269
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,040
anti sound we want and

270
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,280
how many of modified we want so do that

271
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,180
with mixing it out and achieving more

272
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:33,580
realistic sound that's right okay so now

273
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,620
we have reverberate that sound

274
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:53,220
[Music]

275
00:21:53,230 --> 00:22:01,600


276
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,140
and we can increase delay to immolate

277
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:14,120
response from some space let's try some

278
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:38,990
hole okay and if you combined everything

279
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,559
together we can achieve some white

280
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:48,650
Lydian guitar sound ready for solos

281
00:22:48,650 --> 00:23:21,870
[Music]

282
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,510
right listen for it without libration it

283
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:32,380
sounds without volume like

284
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:44,430
[Music]

285
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,550
let's try something more

286
00:23:48,550 --> 00:24:19,090
[Music]

287
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:41,550


288
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:50,930
[Music]

289
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,280


290
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,620
or we can do something like that

291
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,500
[Applause]

292
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:39,200
[Music]

293
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,250
[Applause]

294
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,660
[Music]

295
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,710
[Applause]

296
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,960
so yeah as I told you before we creating

297
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,570
all these vows for reverberation click

298
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,720
create channel splitter first then we

299
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,990
create in the delay node we creation

300
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,780
tone note this big fat filter the

301
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,010
creation can go over and gain nose for

302
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,140
increasing make up our come over

303
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,230
afterwards then we create another gain

304
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,200
node that will be used in parallel for

305
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,740
dry sound and we created merger to merge

306
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,400
everything back then we need to actually

307
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,800
build this graph so we connection

308
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,590
everything chain by chain splitter with

309
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,870
the lead away with don't always come

310
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,050
over and over we sweat and to merger and

311
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,620
in parallel we connections right again

312
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,190
note if we connect in splitter to it and

313
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,020
then dry no to merger and that's how we

314
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,810
achieve it so should recap what I showed

315
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,390
today so I showed first of all how to

316
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,330
connect your stream source to

317
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,060
destination how to control volume using

318
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,420
game node how to create distortion

319
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,090
effects using wave shaper note that

320
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,930
because filter for tone control I showed

321
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,440
how to emulate cabinets with controller

322
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,830
nodes and how to implement reverberation

323
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,100
using channel measure and splitter delay

324
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,520
nodes because filters and making

325
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,540
everything up so just try it at home

326
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,300
every all the code available on github

327
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,830
application is deployed on github pages

328
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:37,350
as well try it and rocket thank you for

329
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,330
listening

330
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,990
[Applause]

331
00:27:40,990 --> 00:28:42,950
