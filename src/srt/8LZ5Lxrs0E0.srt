1
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:21,310

you

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,210
so historically I'd say the web platform

3
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,050
has really been this kind of clutch it's

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,720
grown organically into more or less a

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,110
mess it has no sense of cohesion most of

6
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,580
the API is that we have to deal with

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,250
have been poorly designed by C++

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,500
developers and they write them in this

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,140
binding layer called IDL which was

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,570
originally meant for korba if you can

11
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,019
believe that and and you know even more

12
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:53,030
so than just the the problems with what

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,800
we already have there's a things we

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,719
don't have there's the major gaps in

15
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,210
what we can do on the web compared to

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,370
native apps compared to desktop apps

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,009
compared to mobile apps and even for

18
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,990
those things we can do we end up doing

19
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,119
them mostly by drowning ourselves in

20
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,090
large JavaScript libraries that polyfill

21
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,950
like this functionality that we need or

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,869
let us create a new select element so

23
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,539
that we just really we can style it so

24
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:19,369
why does this happen what's what's the

25
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,110
problem with the web with this platform

26
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,020
that we've we all love and work on well

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,420
the problem is really in the process I

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,240
claim and the deal is that generally

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,610
when we introduce new features into our

30
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,369
web platform it's done via this this

31
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:36,590
complicated waterfall this months or

32
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,869
years of mailing lists standardization

33
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:41,869
where people debate to no end like the

34
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,970
my new details of how exactly the

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,490
perfect API should work from their

36
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,619
perspective and they write it down in

37
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:51,350
prose or in this this web IDL interface

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,299
definition language and there in the end

39
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,920
they're really driven by this scenario

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,659
solving idea where they say oh we have

41
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,159
this problem we need to solve it let's

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,649
let's throw some C++ over the wall

43
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:04,219
attach a tag name to it and then say oh

44
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,890
here you go here's your API so we get

45
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,630
this fundamental capability that we want

46
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,940
but instead of getting a kind of exposed

47
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,280
in a way we want to use we get this high

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,980
level thing that just burrows down from

49
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,459
some tag down to C++ we can't customize

50
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,170
it we can't work with it in the way that

51
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,430
we'd want to if we'd written it

52
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,370
ourselves in JavaScript and all this

53
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,989
time you know you eventually get this

54
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,079
thing as troublesome as it may be well

55
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,669
you try and use it and you end up

56
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:33,169
telling the standards body as wow it's

57
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:33,980
it's kind of a hue

58
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,019
mess and it solves half your problems

59
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,870
and half the time I mean indexdb is kind

60
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,220
of the quintessential example of huge

61
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,409
mess but this is just a general issue

62
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,830
with most the api's today and yet

63
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,870
despite all of this like somehow as a

64
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,599
platform we've we've done just okay I

65
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,360
mean well okay maybe better than okay

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,890
maybe we're the most successful platform

67
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,700
ever how did we manage to do that well

68
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,379
there's a few few techniques that we've

69
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,310
used as a community we've wrapped we've

70
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,069
said you know your API sucks let me

71
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:09,500
build a better one jquery is the most

72
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,209
famous example of this obviously but we

73
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,849
also do this amazing thing which was

74
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:16,430
called prolly filling we're saying

75
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,280
wouldn't it be cool if we could select

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,410
elements in the dom using CSS selectors

77
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,230
and the sizzle is born or wouldn't it be

78
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,900
cool if we could create custom tags that

79
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,400
have their own behaviors just like

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,170
normal HTML tags and thus something like

81
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,690
angularjs is born so these are these are

82
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,090
prolly fills right like a probably this

83
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,709
will fill in for the future of our

84
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,200
language and of our platform and

85
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,260
eventually they do but but sometimes

86
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,669
that isn't enough sometimes we need to

87
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:45,680
transpile write our language itself

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,139
fails us so we create things like SAS

89
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,959
well i'm with which extend CSS with some

90
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,720
pretty darn obvious features or

91
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,620
CoffeeScript it just gives us a more

92
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,470
expressive language to work in these

93
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,630
have their problems but but in the end

94
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,849
they helped us a lot towards a more

95
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,340
expressive platform finally in one case

96
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,840
that's particularly close to my heart

97
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,030
you know we even built an interoperable

98
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,620
standard among a bunch of implementers

99
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,019
of a certain pattern promises from the

100
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,989
ground up but I mean in general for all

101
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,329
of these things that we do we say we do

102
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,799
them because we need our platform to be

103
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,870
better and so we need to make it better

104
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,080
ourselves so the extensible web

105
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,120
manifesto is this thing we put together

106
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,330
a few months ago saying that the

107
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,090
standards bodies are really ready to do

108
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,800
their part in this this game that's

109
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,080
platform that we're trying to create you

110
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,760
know until now we as the community have

111
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,260
been shouldering all the work we've been

112
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,060
writing our massive JavaScript libraries

113
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,729
or trans piling just to reinvent basic

114
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,110
functionality and get

115
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,540
we want but there's a better way where

116
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,640
we work together with these these bodies

117
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,140
and these implementers towards the

118
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,960
future and so you know well one way of

119
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,610
putting this you know a good analogy I

120
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,110
think is what the standards bodies have

121
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,330
realized is that the web platform is our

122
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,880
language but like all languages it must

123
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,580
evolve and there's two ways that this

124
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,950
primarily happens two ways in which we

125
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,130
extend the web forward as we say so we

126
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,470
need to extend our basic vocabulary our

127
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,260
basic pieces of this language and the

128
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,400
second part is we need to start

129
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,740
incorporating slang I want to go over

130
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,480
some of the things like what does this

131
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,000
mean when I say extending our vocabulary

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,700
there's really two key ideas here first

133
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,830
we need to explain the features of the

134
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,040
platform that are already there so you

135
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,570
know going back to the language analogy

136
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,520
wouldn't it be weird if we had these

137
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,190
compound words like sci-fi but we didn't

138
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,020
actually have words for science or

139
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,630
fiction well that's that's kind of how

140
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,340
it is on the web today if some standards

141
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,500
body maybe the the French making up

142
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,140
words rolled wide consortium just handed

143
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,000
us the word like sandpaper but we never

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,970
actually had a word for sand or paper

145
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,350
individually that's that's the problem

146
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,790
we face today where we have these high

147
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,350
level features but they're not built

148
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,730
from anything that we could actually

149
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,460
reuse and create new words out of create

150
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,250
new new things out of we just have all

151
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,120
this magic compound concepts in the

152
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,950
second part of extending our vocabulary

153
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,360
is giving you new low-level features

154
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,340
that you can use right if you wanted to

155
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,470
invent the word sci-fi somebody better

156
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,760
have come up with the concepts of

157
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,880
science and fiction first right and just

158
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,740
like that on the web there's a lot of

159
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,510
things we just don't have words for and

160
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,640
we're slowly getting there but still

161
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,040
native apps are hurting us here they're

162
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,420
saying we have the ability to access

163
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,610
this device feature we can do the

164
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,430
clipboard but you can't so we need to

165
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,680
extend our platform in a way that's that

166
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,290
takes these into account so with this in

167
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,640
mind like what are what kind of

168
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,190
initiatives are underway to give us this

169
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,930
this new vocabulary this new feature of

170
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,150
the web platform what has the extensible

171
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,310
web philosophy kind of yielded and what

172
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,440
can you look forward to well well first

173
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,030
one the most fundamental gap in the

174
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,640
platform i think is is how these darn

175
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,889
tag things work

176
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:59,229
and custom tags is a feature that tries

177
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,150
to explain that because think about it

178
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,610
right now you feed a string painting

179
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,919
some angle brackets into the browser and

180
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,509
then they get turned into these

181
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,249
JavaScript objects with these wonderful

182
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,919
api's and we call that the Dom how does

183
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,199
that even work right like what what what

184
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,199
tags how do they work we'll custom tags

185
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,729
explain this process they say you

186
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:22,509
register the mapping of tag names to

187
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,189
element prototypes with the browser and

188
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:26,020
then when the HTML parser gets its

189
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,779
string it says oh well I see this tag

190
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,120
let me give you this prototype and this

191
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,500
is great this is this is the

192
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,990
democratization of HTML essentially this

193
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,000
is saying that you are now on the same

194
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,560
level as browser vendors when you want

195
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,930
to create new semantics and new widgets

196
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,150
for your web and what's even great

197
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,310
better about this right is you have no

198
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,810
more of these crazy widget libraries

199
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,520
with their own weird semantics no more

200
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,370
jQuery UI with its option magic function

201
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,110
that sometimes as a setter and sometimes

202
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,520
as a getter and sometimes calls a

203
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,949
function no more dojo digits if you

204
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,659
remember those no more bootstrap

205
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:01,479
craziness div class equals button no

206
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,550
more win j/s with its wind control

207
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,069
property off which all the magic happens

208
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,750
right like just you have tags and they

209
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,669
turn into elements and they behave like

210
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:11,169
normal Dom things with getters and

211
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,509
setters and properties and methods and

212
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,539
just like you'd expect so now we have

213
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,009
the ability to do this in our platform

214
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,580
and this is coming but even you know

215
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,050
what about all the existing tags right

216
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,550
half the reason we have these widget

217
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,349
libraries these jQuery UI is and so on

218
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:27,789
is just this so that you can create your

219
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,159
own custom select because otherwise you

220
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,110
can't style it you can't you can't

221
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,419
customize it I mean in general this is a

222
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,279
problem with our existing platform right

223
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,140
we have these tags these magic tags like

224
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,339
select or input or details or video with

225
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,320
these pieces that you can't really reach

226
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,420
even something as simple as Li has this

227
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,190
bullet which is like where did that come

228
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,740
from you know what's the explanation for

229
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,240
that there's this extra stuff the

230
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,130
browser is doing but you have no idea

231
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,220
how well so the concept that we've come

232
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,380
up to explain this with to explain this

233
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,600
is the shadow Dom the idea that there's

234
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,250
a Dom behind the Dom that you can

235
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,019
normally access we're all these hidden

236
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,910
little pieces the the controls the

237
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,760
placeholders the bullets whatever

238
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,070
where they live and what's great is that

239
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,810
once we have a basis for these hidden

240
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,510
parts of the Dom in reality instead of

241
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,750
in C++ magic land then we can hook into

242
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,730
styling and rebuilding and extending

243
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,370
these controls instead of having to

244
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,110
rebuild them entirely in JavaScript with

245
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,570
all the accessibility issues and

246
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,260
behavior issues and cross-platform

247
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,750
issues that come along with that and so

248
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,280
I you know a couple of days ago as

249
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,700
researching for this and I saw this this

250
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,130
beautiful beautiful line on the blink

251
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,170
dev forum which I want to just take a

252
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,640
moment to read to you which is I'm

253
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,770
working on transitioning the select

254
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,110
element from a custom renderer to shadow

255
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,500
Dom tears of joy guys you know after so

256
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,260
many years of having this this horrible

257
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,880
select element having the designers be

258
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,530
like no you need to create a custom

259
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,590
select soon soon we're going to be able

260
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,230
to style select and customize it and

261
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,480
make a combo box and everything will be

262
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:14,140
beautiful so a good example of both

263
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,210
adding new capabilities and explaining

264
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,340
the old ones is Web Audio because Web

265
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,290
Audio is about new capabilities in a

266
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,880
large part you can do fundamentally new

267
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,380
things like we've already seen a few

268
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,660
talks today on positional audio audio

269
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,840
synthesis really great stuff but if you

270
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,610
remember the first time audio gone to

271
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,860
the web was back in 2009 we had this

272
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,110
audio tag which is kind of the

273
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,720
quintessential throws some C++ magic

274
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,580
over the wall to you given this high

275
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,050
level construct with limited

276
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,210
customizability and just like all these

277
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,700
this restrictions right that's from the

278
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,710
extensible web perspective the audio tag

279
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,330
should essentially be explained in terms

280
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,430
of web audio and that's the direction

281
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,840
we're trying to go we're trying to say

282
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,120
all these you know high level things we

283
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,460
need a way to explain them and audio is

284
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,190
just a great example of that and more

285
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,810
generally for new capabilities we're

286
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,160
getting a lot of these in the platform

287
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,540
more and more as we go a lot of

288
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,850
Mozilla's Firefox OS work is pushing the

289
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,500
boundaries here saying we need to have

290
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,690
all these capabilities and so things

291
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,160
like full screen notifications you

292
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,350
location and so on this is the kind of

293
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,520
thing that we're going to get parodied

294
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,410
with native apps and what's cool is that

295
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,060
we've prioritized these things we've

296
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,610
said you know the extensible web is all

297
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,030
about saying these are the most

298
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,140
things to get in the platform because

299
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,030
these are the things we cannot do we

300
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,680
don't need to design a perfect new

301
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,410
database API we need to design you know

302
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,100
full screen finally you know the last

303
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,900
piece of extending our vocabulary is

304
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,940
extending the base language JavaScript

305
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,770
that we work in and the features coming

306
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,050
up in Ekron scoop 6 and X America soup 7

307
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,520
are going to give us these capabilities

308
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,040
and so they're kind of subtle but like

309
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,100
for example in Equus script 6 there's a

310
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,510
lot of work going in to make sure the

311
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,490
built-ins things like array or date or

312
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,770
so on are extensible so instead of

313
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,420
having to rebuild the entire date

314
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,460
parsing logic just because you need to

315
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,080
be able to format dates you'll be able

316
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,840
to do you know class moment extends date

317
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,470
you know instead of and in so proxies is

318
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,820
another good example of this you know

319
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,160
things like Amber or backbone or so on

320
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,320
you know they all need this this custom

321
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,390
object model that can intercept all the

322
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,760
gets and sets and method calls well

323
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,530
right now they end up rebuilding a

324
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,690
parallel object model you know the

325
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,090
saying oh you have to use get set and

326
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,030
all this crazy stuff well proxies will

327
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,830
actually be able to use normal

328
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,630
JavaScript semantics to allow you to

329
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,400
build your own objects of the type you

330
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,880
need and in es7 will have object not

331
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,790
observe and which allows you to observe

332
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,380
arbitrary properties of an object

333
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,420
perfect for data binding and similarly

334
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,340
weak references which is a great thing

335
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,680
that will be able to use to bind view

336
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
models and models and so on together and

337
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,100
not have to worry about cleaning up

338
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,020
after ourselves I'm in this in this way

339
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,930
and so now that we have this capable

340
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,160
platform right with all these new

341
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,590
low-level capabilities and with our

342
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,600
existing capabilities you know composed

343
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,850
out of low level primitives will be able

344
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,410
to stop rebuilding the entire platform

345
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,050
just to customize one piece but there's

346
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,150
one thing left you know the second half

347
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,250
of the extensible web which is that we

348
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,570
need to tighten the feedback loop

349
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,460
between developers and standards bodies

350
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,140
and in short we need to incorporate the

351
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,910
slang that you guys are already building

352
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,970
over and over into the platform itself

353
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,800
because think about it you you've built

354
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,030
all these great things out of low-level

355
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,920
tools but now you're downloading

356
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,200
megabytes of JavaScript or trans piling

357
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,060
from some other you know non non

358
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,000
standard language and fracturing the

359
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,130
community you know because you need to

360
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,830
get your base platform up and running

361
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,990
this is why I almost every web page uses

362
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,730
jQuery you know the platform hasn't

363
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,800
stepped up to the plate and incorporated

364
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,780
jquery's innovations back in but we're

365
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,110
trying to change this to right so so one

366
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,790
of the greatest you know easiest

367
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,620
examples of this philosophy of saying

368
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,970
you know we've been doing this for a

369
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,940
long time let's do it you know let's put

370
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,470
it in the standard is the template tag

371
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,570
you know everybody knows script type

372
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,730
equals textext handlebars or whatever

373
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,010
like all these these crazy custom script

374
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,450
tags that you use to put your templates

375
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,760
well we finally recognized that this

376
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,470
pattern is something that we actually

377
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,150
need support for in the platform it

378
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,160
needs to be optimized it fast a native

379
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,080
and injection proof and that's why we

380
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,150
have this template tag which is now it's

381
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,100
now in the spec it's being implemented

382
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,850
in browsers you know even more like

383
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,710
higher level something like dialogue

384
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,310
right you know j.crew UI dialog has been

385
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,930
around in a venerable workhorse and a

386
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,630
pain in my ass like for many many years

387
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,800
but it's the best thing out there well

388
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,360
wouldn't it be nice if we actually

389
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,190
recognize that this is a common pattern

390
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,220
and put it in the platform so that's

391
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,660
exactly what is in there now we have

392
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,640
this dialogue tag represents a dialogue

393
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,950
has open closed result return value like

394
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,030
we can actually say Oh developers are

395
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,010
doing this over and over why don't we do

396
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,050
it for them so that's what we're trying

397
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,200
to do here you know turning to CSS right

398
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,260
like these basic basic things like like

399
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,420
variables or reset style sheets or

400
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,540
nesting of you know when you offer your

401
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,000
CSS well there's actually the people in

402
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,490
charge of CSS have realized we need to

403
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,840
start doing this we need to incorporate

404
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,850
this we need our base language not to be

405
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,650
just a compile target but actually

406
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,910
something that's reasonable to write it

407
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,490
so there's specs you know variables and

408
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,410
hierarchies you know borrowing from SAS

409
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,990
but also unset which is this ability to

410
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,580
basically create reset style sheets in

411
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,680
one line star property unset right and

412
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,600
so that's that's the basic idea there

413
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,620
pointer events a good example

414
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,450
Microsoft's been pushing this very hard

415
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,830
but they're pushing it for a good reason

416
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,540
because we've got all these libraries

417
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,420
abstracting away saying oh you know both

418
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,600
touch and mouse are pointers and when

419
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,400
somebody clicks or touches I want to

420
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,329
create an event

421
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,009
of course that seems pretty obvious in

422
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:52,720
retrospect but that's what pointer

423
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,489
events are giving you because and now we

424
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:55,779
don't have to create those libraries

425
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:57,160
unifying them and unifying these

426
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,529
concepts and you know of course

427
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,579
something very close to my hardest

428
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:04,959
promises you know when you have a

429
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,569
pattern that's been adopted by jquery by

430
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:10,809
dojo by angular by ember by wind j s and

431
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,540
by yui maybe it's time to put these in

432
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,709
the platform maybe it's time to

433
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,629
recognize we have consensus on an async

434
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:18,610
primitive and that now we can build on

435
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,389
top of that so what's next what's next

436
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,369
for this extensible web philosophy that

437
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:26,649
has brought us all these goodies and is

438
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:29,619
still bringing them to us well this is

439
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,809
just a sneak peek but you know perhaps

440
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:33,279
the most important thing that we need to

441
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,949
get right next is streams so we have all

442
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:37,929
these crazy abstractions with great

443
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,059
names on the platform right now great

444
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:42,040
interfaces great API is like file reader

445
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,670
you know Rita's array buffer yoo-hoo xml

446
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,489
hvd request best API ever you have to

447
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,939
pass true not to block the browser

448
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:53,319
getusermedia right like there's just

449
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,749
another example some other way of

450
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,399
getting a streaming streaming set of

451
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,439
data postmessage you're posting these

452
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:01,419
messages across iframe boundaries you

453
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:02,649
know you have to build your own

454
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:05,260
streaming protocol on top of that object

455
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,789
URLs which are I think one of the

456
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:09,370
greatest most ingenious but also most

457
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,130
disgusting hacks in the history of the

458
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,139
web platform where you're like oh I have

459
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:16,870
this this URL representing a stream of

460
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,510
data from from the webcam or whatever

461
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,029
i'm going to set image SRC equal to that

462
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:24,699
and we have media streams which is this

463
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:26,439
new way of saying oh well stream data

464
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,750
the video tag I mean it seems like just

465
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,370
like with promises we're missing a very

466
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,559
important piece of slang here that the

467
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,389
platform is already created and no Jas

468
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,639
has led the way but there's a lot of

469
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,000
lessons we can learn from DOJ's mistakes

470
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,139
so to get something that'll work really

471
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:43,149
well with the web platform and unify all

472
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:45,399
these crazy different concepts and then

473
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,039
make our life easier because in the end

474
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,090
we want to be able to take all these

475
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,340
different sources you know URLs which we

476
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,740
fetch data from camera data binary

477
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,210
payloads which are in the cache already

478
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,769
we want to pipe them into different

479
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:58,450
sinks we want to put them in image tags

480
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,559
we're going to put them in video tags

481
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,870
audio tags I'll put them across the

482
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,960
boundary to other I

483
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,179
James we want to have custom ways of

484
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:06,830
consuming them and transforming them and

485
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,340
building things in the browser so that's

486
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,929
that's I think one of the most exciting

487
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:14,809
and most fundamental pieces missing but

488
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:16,010
you know another good example is

489
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,570
something you know the basic act of

490
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,549
doing an HTTP request right because

491
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,110
think about how much complexity we have

492
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,549
built into that system in the browser

493
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,169
right now there's cross-domain

494
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,659
protection there's redirect following

495
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:27,919
there's there's the actual

496
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,720
deserialization process you know if you

497
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,399
want access the raw bytes that's not as

498
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,130
easy as you'd hope there's cookie jars

499
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,809
right maintaining and drawing where your

500
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:38,120
cookies go there's caches you know does

501
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,289
this stuff go in the cache or does it

502
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,140
get pulled directly from the website

503
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,820
what we need to do you know to provide

504
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,679
developers with what they really need to

505
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,740
build the kind of servers we want and

506
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,029
websites we want is to provide the basic

507
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,130
building block just the fetch and then

508
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,659
all of these different features of the

509
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:55,730
platform are just options to fetch or

510
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,250
layers on top of fetch and so that's

511
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,960
what we'll be trying to do you know is

512
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,370
provide the correct primitive not

513
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,380
something as high-level its xhr or as

514
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,960
you know with one semantics for script

515
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,059
tags and one for link tags you want

516
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,789
something like this another and this is

517
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,950
when I've been pushing because I asked

518
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,539
around in chat rooms you know what are

519
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,580
you missing and people tell me over and

520
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,409
over is we need we need Z libs or we

521
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:21,260
need gzip we need zip and so so there's

522
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,240
active investigation going on how are we

523
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,820
going to get gzip exposed to you guys so

524
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,380
that you can actually start g zipping in

525
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,730
the browser right this is something you

526
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,740
can write in j us and people have

527
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,049
trolley filled this they've created a p

528
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:36,049
is that we'll we'll use binary data and

529
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,340
actually do compression in the browser

530
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,559
which is awesome but the browser has

531
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,090
already got some sequel us sitting there

532
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,710
ready to do this for you that should

533
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,820
just be exposed and and perhaps my

534
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,440
favorite because this has just happened

535
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,990
a couple days ago is class elements

536
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,870
extends array this is the new node list

537
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,470
no more stupid you know though for each

538
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,809
is not a function it's like no now we

539
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,549
can actually have something that extends

540
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,289
array has a race semantics you can do

541
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:06,590
map filter for each whatever and that's

542
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,360
what will return

543
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,100
and what else I mean I mean what do we

544
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,900
need guys what's preventing you from

545
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,370
building the web apps of your dreams

546
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,880
well I want you guys to tell us so so

547
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,590
get involved right and the best thing

548
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,570
you can do to get involved you know just

549
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,760
just off the bat with your existing

550
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,600
skills is prolly fill okay so there's

551
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,159
only so much standardization bandwidth

552
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,360
to go around you might think that

553
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,070
there's these people up in their their

554
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,020
ivory towers at Mozilla and Google and

555
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,809
Microsoft like I will type out specs all

556
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,850
day turns out there's actually they

557
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,250
don't have that kind of time right so if

558
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,929
you can create a de facto standard like

559
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:50,450
jQuery or an open specification like

560
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,150
promises a plus the world is waiting for

561
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,610
you to take on that and to show us what

562
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,770
the web should look like so for example

563
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,030
if you wanted to figure out what a

564
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,549
Xeelee of api for browsers look like the

565
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:03,710
best thing that you can do is first

566
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,690
learn what the constraints are and what

567
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,429
the use cases are not just your use case

568
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:09,919
not just no JSE's use case and not just

569
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,820
your your i love whatever use case right

570
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,620
you need to figure out what are we the

571
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,789
problems that everybody is trying to

572
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:18,650
solve that'll make this a good general

573
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,830
purpose solution once you have that then

574
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,650
you can design an API and a library to

575
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,240
probably fill this gap in the platform

576
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,280
something that kind of shows off how is

577
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,350
this going to work and then the last

578
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,789
step and this is what I think a lot of

579
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,860
kind of like the the new jazz developers

580
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,090
don't do they're often their little

581
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,740
world saying oh we'll build this awesome

582
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,780
thing you will need to evangelize its

583
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,390
use you need to ship it to everyone so

584
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,669
that everybody sees oh this is the

585
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,950
perfect way to do z lib this is the way

586
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,809
that at this is the great API this is

587
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,090
general purpose low-level exactly what

588
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,490
we want and so when everybody recognized

589
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,289
this is the clear solution for how to do

590
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:56,120
z lib in the browser it's going to be

591
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,039
really easy for the browser vendors to

592
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,960
just say oh let's put that in the

593
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,799
standard done and i want to emphasize

594
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,860
that in general this this extensible web

595
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,860
philosophy has teeth okay it's not just

596
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,230
a bunch of guys wrote a document and and

597
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,970
now all the implementers are going to

598
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,010
ignore them or all the standards writers

599
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,080
are going to ignore them so what's cool

600
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,090
is that the the w3c technical

601
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,340
architecture group which is kind of the

602
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,120
over the

603
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,100
standards by the body overseeing all the

604
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,320
standards bodies I mean had four seats

605
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,900
go up for reelection recently and 44

606
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,820
reformers as they call themselves were

607
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,620
elected at once so yet these people are

608
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,809
you who to cats alex russell marcos

609
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:39,410
cazares and an event kesteren and so the

610
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,880
extensible web philosophy is really

611
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,650
something they they're pushing and

612
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,660
giving this as a mission to the

613
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,670
technical architecture group now this is

614
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,530
the ultimate technical body which gives

615
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,380
governance and guidance to all of the

616
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,210
standards than all the specs that we see

617
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,460
and we've already seen fruit from this

618
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,900
from this technical architecture group

619
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,059
overhaul they've given some really great

620
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,190
feedback you know mediating between

621
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,750
developers and between their own

622
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,490
understanding of JavaScript idioms to

623
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,770
the Web Audio group trying to make that

624
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,360
a more idiomatic and more easy to use

625
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,440
and more low-level spec and generally

626
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,940
just make it less magical and more

627
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,190
JavaScript and what's also cool is that

628
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,690
all their work is being done on github

629
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,910
and and more and more specs are being

630
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,130
done on github at their urging so this

631
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,750
is happening we're really starting to

632
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,059
get a web that we want and wed that we

633
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,780
can participate in how to make friends

634
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,880
and influence standards bodies more

635
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,220
generally like if you have beyond just

636
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,600
prolly filling the kind of thing that

637
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
you already you can build libraries

638
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,990
today if you want to be involved in

639
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,730
helping the web succeed and guide us

640
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,950
towards better standards right then

641
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,590
let's talk okay I mean it's a

642
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,570
complicated subject but this idea of

643
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,520
interfacing with standards bodies and

644
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,540
interfacing the people who write

645
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,280
standards is something I've been diving

646
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,140
into over the last half year or so it

647
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,510
started with my promises work but it's

648
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,850
expanded into many other things you know

649
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,320
finding the right approach is delicate

650
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,820
right these people are very used to you

651
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,960
coming onto their mailing list and

652
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
saying let's add a radar prototype top

653
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,610
my favorite thing and then there that

654
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,350
you just flip the bozo a bit and and

655
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,910
they're like oh well who is this guy we

656
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,620
don't need to tell like listen to him

657
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,210
but if you if you kind of approach in

658
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,670
good faith and have a use case and don't

659
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,470
have a prideful demeanor they're really

660
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,480
happy to listen and I've had a few

661
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,860
success stories where I've kind of

662
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,870
talked other developers through how do

663
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,040
you know what's a good way to approach

664
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,350
this this problem and how should you

665
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,150
talk to and and what channel should you

666
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,300
use in this area already and and by this

667
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,280
time next year I'd love to have a lot

668
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,980
more and i'll be giving a talk at lxj

669
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,809
s with this title and by the way so stay

670
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:40,460
tuned if you want to know more about the

671
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,490
exact process so I finally I want to end

672
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,380
on a hopeful note right because it's

673
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,610
easy to think about all these cool

674
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,960
things that I showed you earlier and all

675
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,730
these cool things that I talked about

676
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,860
coming and then go to back to your job

677
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,240
and get depressed because you have to

678
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,500
support IE 8 or Android 2.3 but but

679
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,660
that's really not so bad when you

680
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,309
consider the alternative this is the

681
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,190
price we pay for the open extensible

682
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,830
multi-platform web as opposed to

683
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,870
something like say dot net where it's

684
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,669
like Oh everybody upgrade from three

685
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:13,340
point 0 2 4.5 sucks if you get left

686
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,559
behind that's that then there's only one

687
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:18,710
of us so no choice right we need to work

688
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,330
through this collaborative process

689
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,400
cooperative process build a shared

690
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,559
language that we can all you know use

691
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,169
together so in the end the future is

692
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:29,059
longer than the past and and i look

693
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:30,260
forward to not only living in that

694
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,360
future but also helping to shape it

695
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:49,270
together with all of you
