1
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:18,890

so I'm Julie I design and build stuff at

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,920
github I it's kind of difficult to

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,500
describe what I do to people who ask in

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,119
passing just because I'm somewhere in

5
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,310
between a designer and a front-end

6
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,360
engineer or developer you can find me

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,910
all over the internets well that sounds

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,920
really disgusting actually you can find

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,269
me on you know very appropriate social

10
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:44,000
media sites at nerdcore and that's three

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,370
hours I'm sorry what ok yeah yeah ok 44

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,100
in total we I stand corrected um ok so

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,519
um I know that the talk description

14
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,289
itself was a little mysterious so I kind

15
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:04,699
of want to go into more a little more

16
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,649
detail about what the talk is that I

17
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,810
will be giving today actually while I do

18
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,570
it so the description I gave was we

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,580
build systems we build systems that

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,590
evolve and grow with a company its users

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,630
and both of their needs and the way we

22
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,979
design and build these systems should

23
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,720
reflect the living breathing things we

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,429
want to create and leave more room for

25
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:24,649
them to grow so the question is like how

26
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:26,209
do we accomplish this with static assets

27
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:29,569
like Photoshop comms for example and the

28
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:31,670
answer is we don't the answer is we set

29
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,560
them all on fire and we start in the

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,989
future and for me and I think for a lot

31
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:38,780
of developers and designers who you know

32
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,119
code I think the future is very much the

33
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,030
browser okay so I did some very

34
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,280
scientific research because I wanted to

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,979
know what the you know general opinion

36
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,860
on Photoshop was and so I you know

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,470
obviously credible sources they grew

38
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,099
degree so the Internet agrees um because

39
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:04,700
fuck Photoshop other there may be a few

40
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,950
f-bombs dropped in this talk if you if

41
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,360
you didn't see that coming i apologize

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,270
thank you thank you for my inappropriate

43
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,430
pneus um ok so so the process so when we

44
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,670
use a one tool like Photoshop to design

45
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,560
and build websites we give that to land

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,180
the company who makes it absolute power

47
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,370
over our process we no longer can

48
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,200
control that process and it's a very

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,030
centralized right

50
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,980
um whoa okay so uh when I say that I

51
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,110
design in browser it doesn't mean that I

52
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,480
write code in web inspector and then

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,430
export it to you know some text editor

54
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,740
it means that i start in code and i

55
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,270
almost work exclusively in code so a

56
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,340
website design should start where it's

57
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,810
going to live and this is a quote by

58
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,910
Megan Fisher she's a really early

59
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,890
proponent of doing mock up and markup

60
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,540
and it's she's someone that I've

61
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,310
definitely followed and looked up to in

62
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,489
this respect so she definitely she and I

63
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,380
both believe that you should wherever

64
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,239
whatever you're building it should

65
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,890
probably start where it's going to live

66
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,390
or exist so for me I love building

67
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,840
things for the browser I i love WebKit i

68
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,900
love i love you know styling things

69
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,950
designing things been building them

70
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,319
specifically in browser we hear so we

71
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,760
hear the word dev environment all the

72
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,739
time but we never hear design

73
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:27,319
environment design tool is much more

74
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,970
common like you use a tool to design you

75
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,860
use photoshop you use illustrator use

76
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,400
fireworks sometimes maybe keynote I

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,410
heard that's like up and coming or

78
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,230
something so so it turns out the browser

79
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,140
actually provides a pretty neat little

80
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,090
package environment for designers and

81
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm going to try to elaborate on that

82
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,720
what that means for you guys adds both

83
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,400
developers and if you're a designer as

84
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,600
well so so luckily I have some help it's

85
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,980
not just the browser doing all the work

86
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,040
I work primarily from the command line

87
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,680
is how I push and pull code to github

88
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,030
and that's where I host my coat

89
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,340
obviously I think I would not be working

90
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,230
there if I used bitbucket or some

91
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,780
equivalent of that so basically my

92
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,109
workflow is somewhat between you know a

93
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:15,470
text editor obviously my terminal and

94
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,350
then the browser so when I make design

95
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,209
decisions or design decisions I'm

96
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,600
thinking in code so css3 is fucking

97
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,680
beautiful so so it wasn't until css3

98
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,330
that we really had the option to create

99
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,650
really like you know the glossy sort of

100
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,300
really beautiful aesthetics that you can

101
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,729
you see in a lot of Photoshop comps with

102
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:38,990
sort of like the lighting effects

103
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,210
photoshop effects don't actually

104
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,889
translate pixel for pixel

105
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,349
um you know into the browser like colors

106
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:46,669
render differently in different browsers

107
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,830
and then shadows rendered differently

108
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,780
according to like what rendering engine

109
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,090
you know browser uses so so because css3

110
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,620
was our first shot at creating like

111
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,779
these effects in browser we got things

112
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,539
like multiple scalable background images

113
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,069
like you can see him this is something

114
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:05,629
from Dance Theatre home I don't know if

115
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:07,159
if anyone's familiar with him but he's

116
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:09,680
um he invented he started the company

117
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,050
dribble and has been a really successful

118
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,409
designer even before that and he wrote

119
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:20,120
the book apart about css3 so so along

120
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,150
with background images ingredients

121
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,650
lighting effects with box shadows and

122
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,060
transition with like interactive

123
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,199
elements like I don't know like a trenta

124
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,520
CSS rotating all these different things

125
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,650
now there's full animation libraries

126
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,089
that you can use to create the same

127
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,229
effects that we would normally use

128
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,529
JavaScript to create so there's always

129
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,719
going to be this inconsistency going

130
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:45,349
from comps to the browser so so the key

131
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,389
the key thing with that is not to panic

132
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,819
and to do the work now instead of later

133
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,979
so when you start in Photoshop and you

134
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,419
create this beautiful comp and you think

135
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,219
it's perfect and you ship it off to your

136
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:57,169
front-end developer and you say or maybe

137
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:58,250
you're on the other side of that and

138
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,689
you're the front-end developer who gets

139
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:04,039
that Photoshop comp handed to you so

140
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,810
implementing that design on the front is

141
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,580
you're gonna you're going to find a

142
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,379
couple things are different right you're

143
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,520
going to find that may be your type

144
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,259
doesn't render the same way you're going

145
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:13,669
to find that you know the color palette

146
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:14,960
looks slightly different in other

147
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,870
browsers and instead of going you know

148
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,909
back to photoshop it's a lot easier just

149
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:23,479
to start in the browser to begin with so

150
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,610
that you this is incredibly small for

151
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,349
for these screens but you can actually

152
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:31,909
see the text rendering differences Megan

153
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:33,529
Fisher again wrote an article about

154
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,060
designing in browser and pointed out the

155
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,919
font rendering effects and photoshop

156
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,419
don't really keep up with the browser

157
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,870
and i'm pretty sure with cs6 it just got

158
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,789
a little worse now you have these kind

159
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,129
of like arbitrary options of sharp chris

160
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,080
strong and smooth which obviously don't

161
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
translate to browser at all if you know

162
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,709
anything about text rendering and

163
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:54,229
browser it's either anti a list or

164
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,510
sub-pixel anti-alias

165
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,340
so it's becoming even more complicated

166
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,310
over necessary like not necessarily

167
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:11,990
commented okay so assassin s CSS are

168
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,270
your new best friend both as a designer

169
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,490
and a developer so if you're not

170
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,680
familiar with sass it's basically a tool

171
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,110
that kind of hack CSS to allow you to

172
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,480
pass in logic that spits out a value

173
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,770
that the browser can interpret so it

174
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,630
also allows you to do things like much

175
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,330
more efficiently so for example this is

176
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,580
like a really a momentary example but

177
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,050
for instance you can pass in a variable

178
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,940
here for the color gray and I can say

179
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,860
okay on the board on the top border of

180
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,540
this button I want to make that color

181
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,130
ten percent lighter and it actually

182
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,990
spits out that hex value in the browser

183
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,640
which then I mean if you decide you

184
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,320
don't want to have all of these

185
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,970
variables you can actually go back and

186
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,560
fill in the hex color that the browser

187
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,000
sits out but it's much better than

188
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,580
sitting and like a GUI and hand picking

189
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,350
the colors you know from your favorite

190
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,060
websites or whatever it is that you do

191
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,450
to get that consistency so you know the

192
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,220
opposite would be darkened you can take

193
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,420
that same variable and say I want to

194
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,040
darken this by ten percent and get those

195
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,990
effects without having to kind of repeat

196
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,440
the process in Photoshop another thing i

197
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,260
really really love about SAS and spss is

198
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,670
the way that it handles errors

199
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,440
specifically when you're writing like

200
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,180
for instance of rails app like we do at

201
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,190
github our main github com is a ruby on

202
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,470
rails app so what's great is it actually

203
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,750
throws syntax errors for you and tells

204
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,080
you what line of code is creating that

205
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,750
error which is really useful because if

206
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,490
you have ever written a CSS file before

207
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,590
it normally doesn't and you could have

208
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,720
left off like an arbitrary semicolon

209
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,729
from you know some element and you will

210
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,470
have to go through line by line to try

211
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,540
to find where where you fuck that up and

212
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,730
so it's a lot easier if the browser is

213
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,310
telling you you fucked up here go and

214
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,720
fix your mistake and everything will be

215
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,920
fine so the great thing another really

216
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,750
wonderful thing about designing in

217
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,220
browsers is that there's fewer surprises

218
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,110
like I said the translation from a

219
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,080
Photoshop comp into a you know a browser

220
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,740
is never going to be exactly precise but

221
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,120
and you don't really want to deal with

222
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,590
those surprises because if you're

223
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,320
working between

224
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,970
people it means that you can no longer

225
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,100
you can't do the job that you want to do

226
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,350
until they correct that mistake or make

227
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,060
it more consistent and that was in their

228
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,500
cons so you can create sort of this test

229
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,960
suite for yourself and have cross

230
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,000
browsers in as i like to call it and do

231
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,830
it all at the same time and this is sort

232
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,600
of the way that my design environment or

233
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,310
my dev environment is set up is i'll

234
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,200
have you know firefox i'll have safari

235
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,530
i'll have chrome obviously all running

236
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,780
at the same time and now with some

237
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,400
amazing developer tools you can actually

238
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,190
change like you can change the browser

239
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,920
agent to anything mobile you can do it

240
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,320
for like an older version of even IE now

241
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,990
on both browsers so it's really really

242
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,570
excellent to be able to kind of you can

243
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,250
see into the future a little bit instead

244
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,330
of fucking yourself in the beginning

245
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,830
okay so you can obviously with developer

246
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,450
tools another really great thing that's

247
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,400
in the browser is you can debug CSS

248
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,140
which like I said it could be a little

249
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,060
difficult when you don't have something

250
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,430
that's throwing you errors if you've

251
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,990
ever searched the web inspector for

252
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,700
something that's you know overriding a

253
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,440
style before you you can kind of you

254
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,510
understand that frustration and then you

255
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,370
can obviously get a bug JavaScript so

256
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,520
I'm not a JavaScript developer I write

257
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,500
JavaScript but it's not necessarily my

258
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,510
role at github and I know a lot of

259
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,130
people are going to cringe when I say

260
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,460
this but we actually now with anything

261
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,140
new that's written we write purely

262
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,270
coffee script and if you guys want to

263
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,220
see that you guys can go check out

264
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,530
github.com / style guide our style guide

265
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,470
is actually public and you can look at

266
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,230
it we use KSS which is a CSS

267
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,730
documentation that automatically

268
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,640
generates our style guide for us so it's

269
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,000
pretty up to date with the site so why

270
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,530
does why does the designer need to know

271
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,870
javascript or at least uh understand it

272
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,240
to understand that main concepts of

273
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,950
javascript is the interaction layer

274
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,800
right a designer you know you can see

275
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,440
the set places the big organizations

276
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,570
where it's just very granular like you

277
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,490
have a UX designer and then you have a

278
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,170
visual designer and then you have you

279
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,880
know a front-end coder and it's even

280
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,270
more granular than that at some places

281
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,130
but in order to totally understand the

282
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,209
experience you're creating

283
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,040
it's a designer you need to be able to

284
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,869
understand all of the interactions that

285
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:29,550
a user is experiencing when they go to

286
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,800
your site or your app whatever product

287
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,249
you're building so this is a little

288
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:37,079
hostile i realized that after writing it

289
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,910
but software crashes suck their kind of

290
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,029
the worst and a great thing is you know

291
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:46,470
when you're constantly refreshing your

292
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,839
browser you're you're hitting the save

293
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,279
button literally every time you make a

294
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,410
CSS change to view that change and so

295
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,329
you're kind of safeguarding yourself

296
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:55,709
from those photoshop crashes that

297
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:58,170
literally like screw your day like I

298
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,759
don't know anyone who has had that

299
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,350
happen to them who hasn't almost had an

300
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,269
emotional breakdown uh so so yeah so

301
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:07,740
yeah so we have a problem with the would

302
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,709
sell for quashing so obviously when you

303
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,569
save a file and then you refresh it in

304
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:13,649
browser it's not going to affect your

305
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:19,069
code at all okay so version control

306
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:21,509
version control is an awesome design

307
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,279
tool and I don't think enough designers

308
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,329
actually use it the way that it's I kind

309
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,740
of naturally evolved to be used by

310
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,329
designers so I'm going to give you guys

311
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,829
a few tips and maybe if you're not

312
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,749
necessarily a designer you guys can

313
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:35,549
start helping you know the designers you

314
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:37,350
work with understand why version control

315
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,600
is important to your process and getting

316
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,329
the kind of development process closer

317
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,579
to the zine process is kind of I don't

318
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,740
know I think it all I think it'll be a

319
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,439
lot more beneficial for kind of everyone

320
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,910
working together I don't know that

321
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,139
sounds kind of like okay okay so that

322
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,519
was a couple companies now doing this

323
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,889
where they use version control the to

324
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:00,779
manage their design assets square does

325
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,639
it github we definitely do it and

326
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,199
there's a couple github tools that can

327
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,259
actually help you do this a lot better

328
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,299
so long with tracking changes what we

329
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:11,610
have is image diffing do any of you guys

330
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,399
use image diffing on github yeah one

331
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,249
person two people I see like random

332
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:19,259
hands going up awesome I know you guys

333
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,610
are tired this is the last NOC it's so

334
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,769
image shipping is fucking awesome so I'm

335
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:28,769
going to take Facebook's logo and i'm

336
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:29,970
going to show you what you can do with

337
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,949
image dipping in a commit message

338
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,110
basically so you look at the commit and

339
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,699
you see that you know you've changed

340
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:37,529
this you want to see the exact

341
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:38,430
difference between the image

342
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,600
is that you swapped in and out of that

343
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,089
last commit so there's actually four

344
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,620
different modes of image differing and

345
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,540
github and the first ones to up and you

346
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,180
can see them side-by-side the second one

347
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,710
is swipe and you can actually kind of

348
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,880
you kind of you can drag the GUI like

349
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,770
you can drag it drag the anchors to the

350
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,420
side and it actually reveals like the

351
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,080
image beneath it the other one is onion

352
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,779
skin which is basically it's like an

353
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,520
opacity over the other image to see

354
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,830
maybe more like not so much in logos i

355
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,839
think but like in bigger kind of photos

356
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,029
to see like maybe change like the

357
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,010
rounded corners on something for

358
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,940
instance that's a good example okay they

359
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,760
via the oh my god I really thought that

360
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,220
part is when you accidentally delete an

361
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,140
image and you realize that the one you

362
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,089
just uploaded is worse or you made a

363
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,360
mistake so one amazing thing that you

364
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,270
can do with github is you can actually

365
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,760
go back and to that commit and you can

366
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,050
actually you know right click and save

367
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,910
your older image and replace it in your

368
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,920
next commit which is amazing because if

369
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,230
you've ever lost something you know

370
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,940
after you know and realize that it was

371
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,830
actually the thing you needed usually

372
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,690
there's not an out for that definitely

373
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,410
not in Photoshop so designers ask your

374
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,339
Deb's for commit access awesome because

375
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,050
it's the only way you're going to have

376
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,910
more control over the design process and

377
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,860
you're going to be I don't want to say

378
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,940
like more respected but you're

379
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,500
definitely going to have a bigger

380
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,600
opportunity to contribute to your team

381
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,060
and the product you're designing and

382
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,560
developers give your designers commit

383
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,500
access build more trust like your does

384
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,260
like they're gonna break some things

385
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,850
like your designers are going to break

386
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,220
some things but they might not and I

387
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,930
think once they do break some things

388
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,339
they're going to realize how to how to

389
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,779
get themselves out of that Jam or

390
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,880
realize what who they need to go to to

391
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,260
get themselves out of that Jam and it's

392
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,610
kind of invaluable when you're working

393
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,010
on a team and you're working you know

394
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,450
asynchronously so yeah command-line

395
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,550
tools are hard we get that I work from

396
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,870
the command line but most of our

397
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,329
designers actually use one of our

398
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,670
products to do that are like a GUI for

399
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,279
github essentially yeah we know gets

400
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,500
confusing but I think we have this down

401
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,270
so we have a product called github for

402
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,019
Mac

403
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,329
which is basically a GUI interface on

404
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,129
top of get that you can push to github

405
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:58,199
from and it's actually incredibly easy

406
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,959
to use you literally only hit sync and

407
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,489
it syncs the branches for you so there's

408
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:05,220
no push in pool unless you have and like

409
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,860
really bad conflict or merge conflicts

410
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,720
which doesn't usually happen if you're

411
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,429
just replacing assets so it's a pretty

412
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,319
safe thing to give your designers access

413
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:19,220
to so prototyping is great for the soul

414
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,480
so when it's really easy when you write

415
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,879
code so one thing that i do and i found

416
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,230
is a great prototyping tool is just

417
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,850
using the hell out of juice is one of my

418
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,309
favorite things to do so essentially you

419
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:34,100
can start with the code on a gist and

420
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,059
you know it doesn't obviously it

421
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,129
obviously doesn't have to be public but

422
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,239
there are some benefits to it being

423
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,189
public and one of those is adding

424
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:43,170
screenshots in the comments and maybe

425
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,769
even linking to a demo of that and also

426
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,449
receiving comments like people are going

427
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:49,790
to want to contribute to your project

428
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,309
and regardless of if even if it's just a

429
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:54,869
CSS snippet they may have a more

430
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:56,220
effective way of doing it and that's how

431
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,160
you learn and they learn so there's

432
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,679
another tool called ablett and it's an

433
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,199
open source tool made by leav arooo and

434
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,819
it's also really awesome because it

435
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,709
allows you to visualize just and it

436
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,289
actually saves that just to your github

437
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:16,079
when you write code and dalit so CSS is

438
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,279
usable so I we try to stay away from the

439
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,779
whole dry concept like don't repeat

440
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,779
yourself but don't write the same code

441
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,149
twice unless you can make it better or

442
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:28,439
unless you can improve it or someone

443
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,610
else can so if it's not reusable set it

444
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,590
all on fire and start over just burn it

445
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,950
to the ground so pattern libraries are

446
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,840
something that's been coming incredibly

447
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,970
interesting to me especially being a

448
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,580
friend encoder and a designer it's it's

449
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,380
a good way to like study how someone

450
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,510
else implements something and learn from

451
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,399
that but it's also a good way to reuse

452
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:55,980
the CSS and other other parts of the UI

453
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,950
that you normally implement it's really

454
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,450
great to kind of create those patterns

455
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,309
for the pattern libraries for yourself

456
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:05,490
but also for other for other people

457
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,670
okay so I learned how to code from

458
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,530
viewing source I didn't go to school for

459
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,370
computer science and I didn't really

460
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,660
have like a mentor I was really

461
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,370
interested in the way that the the web

462
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,200
worked it was the closest thing to magic

463
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,320
for me and so I really wanted to learn

464
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,170
how they how you know developers created

465
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,420
these certain effects I'm using pure CSS

466
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,520
so I learned from viewing source and I

467
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,679
think it's really important it's a

468
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,090
really important thing to you like past

469
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,400
that forward especially you know I think

470
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,290
designers tend to think of it as their

471
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,080
secret sauce but I mean realistically

472
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,880
their front end coder is just going to

473
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,370
take their take their photoshop comp

474
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,720
they're going to write CSS and you're

475
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,679
going to be able to view the source

476
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,750
regardless so it's better to make it

477
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,330
more consumable for other people in a

478
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,670
pattern library sort of like this so

479
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,559
pairs is something created by Dan

480
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,080
cederholm that he released I think and I

481
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,420
think April or May of this year and it's

482
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,740
really interesting because it's the

483
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,600
first thing that I've seen where it's

484
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,120
like a kind of consolidated front-end

485
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,640
library where you can you can view you

486
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,050
something visually but also keep track

487
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,050
of it based on like kind of a module or

488
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,480
like kind of object oriented CSS which

489
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,140
is really really fucking awesome so I

490
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,080
use gist and other pattern libraries to

491
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,809
open source things all the time because

492
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:26,670
i think that other people can make them

493
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,110
better i think one of the most common

494
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,850
things that happens is i'll open source

495
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,890
something in pure CSS someone will take

496
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,960
it and make like a compass mixed in or

497
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,510
you know apply some other yeah you know

498
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,460
preprocessor to it and I think that's

499
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,000
kind of really really fucking awesome

500
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,170
something that's not it's not really

501
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,809
like common when you think about

502
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,120
designers in general I think like the

503
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,880
first time I saw pattern libraries was I

504
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,100
used dribble buckets I don't know if any

505
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,200
of you four are familiar with us but I

506
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,850
basically use them to identify certain

507
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,130
visual patterns but I always wanted a

508
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,110
way to show the code for that like okay

509
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,630
how do you get there and so pairs is a

510
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,130
really great way to do that it's

511
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,260
actually written in PHP it's open source

512
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,330
but it's in it's on github but it's

513
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,980
written in PHP which I would you

514
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,020
couldn't pay me to touch so if any of

515
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,340
you want to write that in something else

516
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,260
I'll probably give you all my money so I

517
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,270
the future is what I'm hoping for is one

518
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,810
where designers are seen you know almost

519
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,300
as equally as developers are in building

520
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,830
products they sit at the table and

521
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,210
they're people who are respected by

522
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,340
their peers and also contribute as much

523
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,110
as developers due to the products

524
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,220
they're building so as of now I mean I

525
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,590
see this all the time on job sites when

526
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,360
I look at designer rules just to see

527
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,220
what the new qualifications are and how

528
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,410
they're changing all the time and one of

529
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,630
them is always pixel perfect Photoshop

530
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,780
comps like that's your responsibility

531
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,010
and if you're if you're told that's your

532
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,450
responsibility why would you learn

533
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,950
anything else like why would you step

534
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,130
outside of your normal realm in order to

535
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,720
challenge yourself if that's your only

536
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,900
responsibility so if that's your

537
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,790
responsibility then you're in product

538
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,320
that you're producing is a picture of a

539
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,130
website and we don't really build

540
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,510
pictures of websites we build websites

541
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,540
we build ass so I mean I think having

542
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,070
learning these things and designing and

543
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,060
browser is going to give you an

544
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,190
opportunity to have more control over

545
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,560
the process in general and contribute

546
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:31,830
more as well so you're all so fucking

547
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,490
awesome thanks for listening to me uh I

548
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,590
wanted to share a couple resources with

549
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,590
you guys so you can check out the github

550
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,750
style guide its price it's kind of

551
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,280
interesting to see the way we write code

552
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,890
we have like if they're more like

553
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,160
considerations and not hard rules so

554
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,890
that's not 24 ways and do your mock-up

555
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,810
and markup is the article written by

556
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,150
Megan Fisher which is an amazing article

557
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,770
about designing in browser it's a little

558
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,150
old but she was definitely one of the

559
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,370
pioneers of kind of making the shift

560
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:07,320
from static assets to a writing code

561
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,040
like starting in HTML and CSS and then

562
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,220
the dance theater home thing was the

563
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,930
links right here and then sass laying if

564
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,970
you don't if you haven't you sass before

565
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,560
it's definitely worth checking out and

566
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,390
if you haven't used just please use this

567
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,600
they're awesome I put up my buckets on

568
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,860
here because you can kind of see what i

569
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,480
mean about like visual patterns and

570
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,010
trying to kind of like consolidate them

571
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,320
just for not necessarily for like oh i'm

572
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,999
going to take this and i'm going to copy

573
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:36,419
but it's more about understanding like

574
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,819
how people interpret a certain like you

575
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:41,039
I piece or a certain like you know like

576
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,689
a drop down or something really really

577
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:44,309
simple like that it's just exposing

578
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:45,509
yourself to the different ways that

579
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:47,789
people do them and then pairs obviously

580
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:50,549
is a really cool thing to check out if

581
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:53,069
you if you write markup regularly but

582
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:55,529
anyways um that's it and if you have

583
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:58,019
questions I'd be glad to chat or and or

584
00:22:58,019 --> 00:22:59,429
answer your questions now I think I'm

585
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:01,259
the last talk so we have about five

586
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:12,359
minutes I think whoo so awesome yeah so

587
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:20,639
if anyone has a question hey yeah oh do

588
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:22,829
you have any advice for people with a

589
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:25,409
very good photoshop skill how to transit

590
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:29,069
to do javascript and CSS skills yeah so

591
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:32,149
I I forget who said this earlier I

592
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:34,829
there's a lot of people who are really

593
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:37,139
interested with like the whole it

594
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:39,179
started in Dreamweaver right where you

595
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,279
can drop in a PSD and it'll right the

596
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,679
CSS for you and every every developer

597
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,259
cringes when they hear that you know so

598
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,169
I I don't recommend to like using one of

599
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:51,239
those tools because I think someone

600
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,789
mentioned before it was like using a GUI

601
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:56,359
is not really learning to code and

602
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,649
you're not going to learn how to solve

603
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:00,869
the problems that you're going to end up

604
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:01,979
facing or just kind of going to

605
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:04,409
overcomplicate things so let's learn to

606
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,599
code is my best piece of advice I mean

607
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,739
uh I mean I know what I just I don't

608
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:12,359
think software development is that hard

609
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,379
uh yeah I really don't I think it's I

610
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:17,969
think it's I think if there's a high

611
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:19,529
barrier to entry but I think if you're

612
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:20,879
passionate enough about what you do and

613
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:22,979
you want to contribute more and you want

614
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:24,779
to learn more the thing about designing

615
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:26,549
in browser is the browser's constantly

616
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,289
changing you know it's decentralized

617
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:30,179
obviously it's not in one tool but it's

618
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,409
constantly changing so it's constantly

619
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:33,749
forcing you to pick new things up right

620
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:35,939
and you uh you want to do that because

621
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:37,619
your coworkers are going to do that you

622
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:38,969
know and otherwise you're going to fall

623
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:41,729
behind and I don't know I mean it's not

624
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:43,679
the end of the world but I think that

625
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,629
it's it's it's going to always challenge

626
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:47,280
you so I guess my best

627
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,230
I should beat always to learn how to

628
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:56,040
code this is a question specifically

629
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,500
about comparing images and using github

630
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,460
for Mac and the the way that a lot of

631
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,850
design works is you produce multiple

632
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,160
versions of the same concept and they're

633
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,230
not it's not the same progression

634
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,930
forward the way it would be with other

635
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,480
code you would sort of branch out

636
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,030
literally and to say five ideas my

637
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,840
question is is it pretty simple for

638
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,120
someone who's a bit intimidated by get

639
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,670
to then compare their versions against

640
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,800
each other and the other I think problem

641
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,590
is when you when you want to see all of

642
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,210
them together is there any thought about

643
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,110
show me all the versions you know the

644
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,420
way that we do it is through purely

645
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,700
screenshots that's kind of the way we do

646
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,680
it the way we discuss different versions

647
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,480
is yeah you would you basically break

648
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,060
something out on a branch you know and I

649
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,320
don't think that part is necessarily

650
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,320
challenging but the workflow the way

651
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,360
that we do it and we find it really

652
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,680
efficient I don't know that it's the

653
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,590
easiest way is we essentially just after

654
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,910
we're done marking something up even if

655
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,290
you end up doing it in photoshop and you

656
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,610
just want to start a branch to start a

657
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,440
discussion you know and start a pull

658
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,940
request and start talking about you know

659
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,500
the different versions of the design we

660
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,420
literally just take screenshots and drop

661
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,860
them in and then we start pointing

662
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,800
things out I mean it's it's it's a good

663
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,660
it's a good visual way to discuss what's

664
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,980
going on in the code and if there's not

665
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,900
code it's a good way to discuss future

666
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:30,860
steps yeah one more question sir anyway

667
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,710
um so you talked about doing doing

668
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,200
design starting design entirely in code

669
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,780
right do you have any steps before thats

670
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,530
a paper or yeah anything else like um so

671
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,900
I saw this really amazing treat actually

672
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,820
I think it was from Jeff Broderick um

673
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,010
who said that designers actually spend

674
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,660
more time thinking than they do

675
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,370
designing and I think that's absolutely

676
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,690
right i think i think that uh if you're

677
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,430
not spending more time thinking then

678
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,140
designing you're just pushing pixels

679
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,970
push pixels and it's not really that

680
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,410
feeling of accomplishment that you're

681
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,290
probably looking for but yeah so I start

682
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,400
with sketching I sketch I I don't like

683
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,560
that's my the way that I used wireframes

684
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,210
basically is I sketch things out i

685
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,100
scribble my sketches look like a

686
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,050
third-grader did them they're pretty

687
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,910
awful but it definitely gives me an idea

688
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,770
of where to go like I'd usually don't

689
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:29,760
start from nothing right yeah cool thank
