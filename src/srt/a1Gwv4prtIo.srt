1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,160

yeah I am going to talk a little bit

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,740
about the thing that sits here and my

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,990
own software and stuff but like I said

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,869
this morning I've been asked to do

5
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,869
something different I'm I'm not the best

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,600
human beatbox in the world as you can

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,250
imagine otherwise I wouldn't be a

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,369
software developer anymore because human

9
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,489
beatboxing is just so much more fun but

10
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,510
if you're interested in how this works

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,879
and what you can do yourself you can

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,890
follow along so this is going to be like

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,879
a very simple explanation I'm going to

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,980
show three fundamental sounds of human

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,649
beatboxing the first one is the bass

16
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:57,600
drum it goes a little bit like this this

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,210
is not it could be louder but that's

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,059
probably fine and if you want to follow

19
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,729
along and you want to try this yourself

20
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,159
you should probably stand up because

21
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,780
it's it's kind of hard to beat barks

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,290
while sitting so if you want to you want

23
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,299
to do that nice and so there are there

24
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,750
few fundamental ways how you can do a

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,810
bass drum and it's basically two

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,470
different types of yeah sounds you can

27
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,850
make the first one is a little bit like

28
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:39,270
try that and it sounds unimpressive but

29
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,320
that's because you don't have a

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,939
microphone like a lot of human

31
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,310
beatboxing relies on the fact that you

32
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,479
have a microphone and the microphone

33
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,020
responds in a specific way to the sound

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,540
waves that your lips make and it sounds

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,090
dull like that sounds like nothing but

36
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,979
if you have a microphone it will sound

37
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,020
more impressive and the other one is

38
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,060
actually a D so you could do something

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:13,449
like

40
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,980
and at some point at some point you need

41
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,569
to start breathing and then things go

42
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:21,000
wrong that's that's totally normal for

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,970
beginners as well the next one is a

44
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,739
snare clap rimshot kind of thing and the

45
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,090
original human beatbox people mostly did

46
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:41,760
like like and it's like and it sounds a

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,370
little bit like a synthesized snare of

48
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:51,329
sorts and yeah try that again now the

49
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,069
interesting thing is if you get into the

50
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,860
breathing rhythm thing you actually need

51
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,959
to learn how to do this backwards so by

52
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,599
not pushing out air but to breathe air

53
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,760
in and this is I I'm not really good at

54
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,590
this so you don't need to try this

55
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,780
because it's hard it goes a little

56
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,729
something like this

57
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,560
and I'm breathing in ear air while I'm

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,810
doing that so it helps with a breathing

59
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,380
rhythm now the second one is a a clap is

60
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,170
really hard to to do with a mouth it's

61
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,940
easier to just clap and that's and

62
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,430
that's because a clap is usually a

63
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,440
couple of impulses that come like in

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,750
random order like if you if you see how

65
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,720
drum synthesizes synthesize collapses

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,060
it's relatively complicated and so what

67
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,430
you can do is a rimshot which is the

68
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,310
sound when the drummer hits the rim of

69
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,280
the snare drum so the outer rim and a

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,709
and it it's a it's a very harsh sounds

71
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,870
look like and it's really just and and

72
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:05,700
that one you can also do backwards and

73
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,400
now we have two sounds and that's

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,569
already something right and the last one

75
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,229
is the high hat cymbal and that's really

76
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:21,869
easy it's really just

77
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:27,680
yeah that sounds right so if you want to

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,060
turn this into a simple rhythm there's a

79
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,250
really nice like a really nice way to

80
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:47,270
say which is just and like I said I

81
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,629
really suck at this so here's a couple

82
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,210
of names to Google of people who can do

83
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,870
it really really well just look at each

84
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,199
YouTube and look at these people doing

85
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,389
things so much better than what I can do

86
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,999
here

87
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:21,349
cool nice okay so why am i doing this so

88
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:25,250
last year's j/s conf EU in Berlin was

89
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,860
really special for me because I

90
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,389
participated in the call for artists and

91
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:32,900
I've been I've been doing weird stuff at

92
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,199
J's confit you for awhile I for some

93
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,389
reason even opened up J's confluence

94
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,569
with another musician doing my live

95
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,069
coding stuff that I was doing back in

96
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:49,400
the time and last year we did music

97
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,020
during the breaks we did the

98
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,960
introduction we did a lot of things and

99
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,080
after the conference ended I was invited

100
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,110
to join live j/s which is sort of a

101
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,479
music group collective of audio visual

102
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,409
artists and you can find out more at

103
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,389
live jazz the network there's also a

104
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,240
live jazz slack if you're interested in

105
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,400
audio-visual stuff it's a very helpful

106
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,650
like it's an open slack very helpful

107
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,949
people with all kinds of info on like

108
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:23,659
modern WebGL visualization stuff web

109
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:27,860
MIDI web audio all of that stuff yeah

110
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,320
this is a picture from like a screen

111
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,129
grab from a youtube video that exists

112
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,979
this is me in the front there and we

113
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,869
were doing the introduction of last

114
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:43,149
year's live Jay Jay s con few I can tell

115
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,509
you that was nerve-wracking it was a lot

116
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:49,509
of fun too so this is most of life Jay s

117
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,479
in one picture there

118
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,199
our current lineup Ruth Tim Martin who

119
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,430
was here yesterday I don't see him today

120
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,249
Sam Matt Meadows Mehta's our New Zealand

121
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,779
representative which sometimes makes

122
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:10,020
travel a little harder than it should be

123
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,229
yeah and like I said I joined last like

124
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:15,580
I said we played at a couple of

125
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,830
conferences Jays continue we are going

126
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,869
to play Jays count of Asia this year

127
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,959
which makes me super happy and also a

128
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,330
bit anxious because I'm flying to

129
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,979
Singapore we played at a s last year we

130
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,360
played a cold front I think two years

131
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,360
ago we played at were Jay s which was a

132
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,999
lot of fun great great conference

133
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,649
maybe we're going to do something again

134
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:46,059
could be and yeah so I needed to come up

135
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:48,360
with a tool that allows me to quickly

136
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,620
improvised music with my with my

137
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,229
synthesizers and my computer and I was

138
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,360
doing like I said I was doing music life

139
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,029
coding before which was fun but also way

140
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,419
too slow I'm a I'm a bad slow coder I

141
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,999
I'm not very good at memorizing all the

142
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:12,009
shortcuts and I wanted to have something

143
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:13,719
that was a little bit more intuitive and

144
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:18,189
quick for me and I wanted to yeah I

145
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,709
wanted to build this tool which would

146
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,809
have a couple of features quick

147
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:24,939
workflows means that I don't need to

148
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,490
kind of go through a lot of menus to do

149
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,800
stuff needs to be all kind of a Tibetan

150
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,620
press it should be pattern based which

151
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,130
is if you know more about music it

152
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,370
probably makes sense to you if not

153
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,110
patterns are basically very small pieces

154
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,880
of music that you repeat over and over

155
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,360
again

156
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,420
and that makes it really easy to

157
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,180
more complex stuff out of them it should

158
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,700
fully utilize the Ableton push which is

159
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,500
this weird thing sitting at the side

160
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,269
here I'm going to hold it up in a second

161
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:57,540
and ideally I wanted to have it so that

162
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,190
I don't need to look at a different

163
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,290
screen I don't want to want it to look

164
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,529
at the computer screen because it's easy

165
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:06,389
to get lost in a computer screen and

166
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:09,149
like if you need to start like moving

167
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,190
your mouse around especially on a touch

168
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,649
pad or something you're already lost in

169
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,860
terms of speed I wanted it to be

170
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,310
built-in with web technologies mostly

171
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,870
because the whole thing is called live

172
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,510
j/s and not live C++ or live rust even

173
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,820
though Matt does have a performance

174
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,290
system that is built on rust but I mean

175
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,360
he also did awesome stuff in JavaScript

176
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,980
so I think that still counts and I

177
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,380
didn't really want to have a huge build

178
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,290
pipeline but that's just me I don't like

179
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,000
to fiddle around with web hacker and

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,579
whatnot and you know with modern web

181
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:51,690
technologies so to speak you can

182
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,820
actually do things like use JavaScript

183
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,890
modules without having a build pipeline

184
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,079
which is pretty cool the Ableton push

185
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,910
tube from the top looks like this it's a

186
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,860
controller that has been Bill

187
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,500
purpose-built for a music software

188
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,449
you're going to see the music software

189
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:12,740
in a second as well but this is very

190
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,100
like it it is very special hardware for

191
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,300
that very special purpose

192
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,269
but fortunately Ableton was kind enough

193
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:23,459
to completely open up the specification

194
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,140
of this thing and even though it has

195
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,300
lots of buttons that are labeled in very

196
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,430
specific Ableton ways you can kind of

197
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,880
use them to your own avail and it has

198
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,149
this awesome collection of 64 buttons in

199
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,850
the middle which are velocity sensitive

200
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,040
so you can play them lighter and harder

201
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,740
and get different sounds out of it

202
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,199
lots of encoders on the top which is a

203
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,569
fancy name for knobs that you can turn

204
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:51,569
endlessly and lots of buttons as well

205
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:55,690
and yeah

206
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,760
there's also a touch strip which is

207
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,380
interesting so it's this piece of

208
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,000
plastic and you can slide your fingers

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,230
across and get different values

210
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,410
depending on where your finger sits lots

211
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,320
of LEDs every button has an LED below it

212
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,230
so you can turn it on turn it off I

213
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,200
don't know something like 60% or so our

214
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,180
RGB LEDs so you can turn them into

215
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,400
different colors as well which is cool

216
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,470
the other half is just white LEDs and it

217
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,360
has a display and we're going to see

218
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,170
that this is interesting because well

219
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,110
with the buttons pads and Coda's and

220
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,060
touch strips and LEDs you can actually

221
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,120
like all the input elements just send me

222
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,950
D I'm going to talk about media in a

223
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,690
second but it's it's like it's a really

224
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,400
simple protocol that is easy to

225
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,830
understand easy to work with and the

226
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,750
LEDs of the on the other hand you just

227
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,670
send MIDI data to the device and it's

228
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,250
gonna display different colors depending

229
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,570
on the values the display is too big and

230
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,240
too high resolution that you could do

231
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
something with Metis there so we need to

232
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,340
figure out what's going on there this is

233
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,340
the official description so you connect

234
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,620
the whole thing by USB and use B as a

235
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,410
so-called composite device with a media

236
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,810
interface and a generic bulk data

237
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,060
interface used to drive the display that

238
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,760
sounds fancy right generic bulk data

239
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:27,070
interface what so use B yes we can do as

240
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,090
we know many things

241
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,150
it's called Universal Serial bus for a

242
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,340
reason so you can have storage devices

243
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,530
you can have so-called human interface

244
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,450
devices as we heard in the talk from

245
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,650
Raman earlier yesterday so human

246
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,900
interface device the keyboard mice game

247
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,730
controllers whatever and then you have

248
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,100
things like audio so you can connect

249
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,340
something that isn't an audio card and

250
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,710
listen to some music you can do media

251
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,690
quite surprisingly and lots of other

252
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,120
stuff and then you can also do generic

253
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,130
data around a KA vendor-specific crap

254
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,310
MIDI like I said is a ver

255
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,820
simple protocol media the media or the

256
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,730
original media specification is from

257
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:20,260
1983 who in here is born after 1983

258
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,050
interesting I mean that sounds like I'm

259
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,390
trying to brag up here but to be honest

260
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,880
like in 1983 I wasn't thinking about

261
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,900
like doing stuff with computers and

262
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,839
synthesizers to be fair because it's

263
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,190
such an old standard it's it's a basic

264
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,560
serial protocol for the most part in

265
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,440
modern API is its encapsulated in a way

266
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,880
that you don't have to parse out the

267
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,640
data yourself so for example from web

268
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,080
MIDI will you will get something like

269
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,500
this which is three bytes that probably

270
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,410
don't mean too much to you so there's no

271
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,050
like high level tagging or anything it's

272
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,900
just you I mean I'm looking at this now

273
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,520
and I know exactly what it does but

274
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,860
that's because I I've been breathing

275
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,190
this stuff for far too long and my brain

276
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,560
is mush with media but let's take a look

277
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,180
so this is actually a command that for

278
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,980
example a keyboard would send if you

279
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,760
press down a key so the first command is

280
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,830
the first byte is a command bite and you

281
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,990
can tell that because the 8th bit of

282
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,890
that byte is set you've seen that right

283
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,970
so I mean the value is over 127

284
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,200
basically so yeah every other thing

285
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,450
you're sending like every data bit byte

286
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,880
you're sending is only like with the 8th

287
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,580
bit not set so it's going to be below

288
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,920
hundred 27 which also means that for

289
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,220
most things you can only send like 127

290
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,550
distinct values which is barely enough

291
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,810
for the for the note which is the second

292
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,230
byte oh yeah and the other thing so in

293
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,170
the the upper four bits of a command by

294
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,200
it encodes the actual command and the

295
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,720
lower four bits encode the channel so

296
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,310
there's sixteen channels you can send

297
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,350
data on

298
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,509
which was more interesting when there

299
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:28,500
were like no when there were like only

300
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,889
like one cable connection nowadays like

301
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,990
every synthesizer has own USB connection

302
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,379
and turns up as a their own MIDI device

303
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,420
and so it's not that needed anymore but

304
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,970
anyway you have 16 channels yeah and the

305
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,879
next one is the note and the note is a

306
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,149
MIDI note number is corresponds to a

307
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,399
note in the twelve in the standard

308
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,680
twelve tone system that we have in in

309
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,259
western music so zero would be a very

310
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:01,560
very low C and a thirty six because it's

311
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,879
12 24 36 values above that is also a C

312
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,860
because every 12 I usually get to see

313
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,899
again and then like a 1 would be a

314
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:19,529
c-sharp 2 would be a D and so on so if

315
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:21,060
you know a little bit about music it

316
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,389
makes sense to you if not I'm sorry I

317
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:29,100
guess and the last value is the velocity

318
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,290
and that's just how hard I hit the key

319
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,470
so 100 is pretty hard given that we have

320
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,519
127 values if I play like if I touch it

321
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,500
really lightly it will be a low value

322
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,920
and so you can send this byte sequence

323
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,930
to a synthesizer and it will start

324
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,970
playing a sound now the problem with

325
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,910
this is depending on the synthesizer it

326
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,589
might never stop playing that sound

327
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:54,870
because that's the different commands so

328
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,540
you would send 128 to actually switch

329
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,809
off the sound you that's one of the

330
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:03,269
things you learn quite early when you're

331
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,429
playing around with me because suddenly

332
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:08,010
you have this cacophony of sounds that

333
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,329
coming from your synthesizing and no

334
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,980
idea why so that's me D let's talk about

335
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,039
the generic bout data interface and this

336
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,510
was a fun little experiment so this is

337
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,539
all from like most of it is from from

338
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:29,280
the documentation from Ableton so what

339
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,559
you do is you have this generic bout

340
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,299
data interface and you use

341
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,090
a library called lip USB which there's a

342
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,850
node module for it and so you're sending

343
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,399
you just send bytes to it basically

344
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:43,679
almost like a serial interface I mean

345
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,139
which is not surprising USB use

346
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:49,049
universal serial bus yeah makes sense

347
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:52,230
make sense and so you send it a frame

348
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,470
header which is just a thing that tells

349
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,600
the device oh there's some data incoming

350
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,009
I should take a look at it and it's just

351
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:02,879
the same 16 bytes every time yeah and

352
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,570
then you sent the frame buffer which is

353
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,279
you know data to display on the on the

354
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,169
display and then you do that all over

355
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:16,769
again you do that 60 frames 60 times per

356
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:18,989
second so you get 60 frames per second

357
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:21,029
if you don't send any data

358
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,399
the device will cache it for about two

359
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,379
seconds or so and then the the display

360
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:29,519
would turn black the frame buffer data

361
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,109
is organized in a slightly weird way you

362
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:36,929
have 16 bit per pixel so it's not like

363
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:39,840
your usual 24 bit thing it's a little

364
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,269
bit less resolution in there makes it a

365
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:45,090
little easier to send raw data over and

366
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,389
it's packed in a kind of weird way so

367
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:52,200
you have something like 5 bits for blue

368
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,190
and then for 6 bits for green and then 5

369
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,279
bits for red and that probably makes

370
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,889
sense for some weird color psychology

371
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:06,059
you know color physic physical reason

372
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,460
whatever I have no idea but that's how

373
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,059
it works

374
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,639
it's little-endian that's something you

375
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:14,159
need to know when you're sending data

376
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:17,489
there's bigger than bytes and for

377
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,379
reasons that I do not completely

378
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:21,409
understand but I think have to do with

379
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:24,509
signal transfer over over the actual

380
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,659
wire you need to XOR it with a specific

381
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:29,909
value for signal shaping I think it's

382
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,519
just to prevent things like zero zero

383
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,769
zero zero for happening on the data bus

384
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:39,600
because that would be bad for the the

385
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,490
signal quality I think so yeah so we now

386
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,800
know what kind of data we need to send

387
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,550
but where do we get them from and I mean

388
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,210
we're web we're on a web conference web

389
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,360
related conference at least and so what

390
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,310
would be easier than using canvas so if

391
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,310
you have a canvas of a certain size why

392
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:11,190
does that there you go okay so if you

393
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,690
have something like a canvas that is a

394
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,080
960 by 160 you can do something like

395
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,620
context get image data and you will get

396
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,740
actual raw pixel data from the formula

397
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,840
canvas which is really cool you have to

398
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,270
know in which way they are organized and

399
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,990
as you will note it's kind of weird

400
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,910
because we have we seem to have four

401
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,700
bytes in there but I only need three of

402
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,330
them what's going on here

403
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,360
so yeah the fourth byte is actually

404
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,520
transparency but I just discard that

405
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,310
because yeah you know I I just show you

406
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,570
like there's no hole in it so

407
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,200
transparency doesn't make any sense

408
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:10,230
anyway well okay so we have an

409
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,330
interesting setup where we actually can

410
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,120
use web technologies to generate the

411
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,460
display data but now we have to send it

412
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,860
over something like little USB which is

413
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,260
a node module which you can't because it

414
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,660
does have native dependencies on the

415
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,940
views B which is a C library you can't

416
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,440
just load it up in your browser that

417
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,060
doesn't make any sense there is a thing

418
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,160
called web use fee has anyone in here

419
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,360
ever used web USB the thing is it needs

420
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,310
to be supported by the hardware there's

421
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:42,309
a specific amendment of the USB spec and

422
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:45,400
I don't think the Ableton push does that

423
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,240
so yeah what you can do is just use

424
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,940
something like electron and then you can

425
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,429
require a native a module with native

426
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:57,760
dependencies in your webview that sounds

427
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,020
scary to me but it works so yeah I'm

428
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,990
just initializing the device and then

429
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,809
send the frame out and that's all so

430
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:34,990
that's how you end up with a display and

431
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,730
it actually it actually works quite well

432
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,520
it's a it's pretty responsive and yeah

433
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,799
like I said this is all drawn on on a

434
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,020
canvas as I can show you because I have

435
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,330
this whole thing here and now if I turn

436
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,710
this knob now if I turn this knob you

437
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,640
can actually see that also being

438
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,900
represented in the canvas element up

439
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,409
here it's just quite cool I have a

440
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:01,750
couple of extra slides I'm running a

441
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:07,419
little bit out of time so I really

442
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,220
wanted to talk a little bit more about

443
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,070
this so why this is a great question I

444
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,400
mean first of all because I can that's

445
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,610
always a good thing because learning I

446
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,039
really wanted to figure out this display

447
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,870
thing and I also really wanted to figure

448
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,900
out how can I build an instrument that

449
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,049
works for myself because that's kind of

450
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:34,390
the important part it's I built my own

451
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,390
instrument I can do whatever I want with

452
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,549
it it's not something where I need to

453
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:42,100
wait for like a new update to a certain

454
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,890
software to make it work better with my

455
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,919
setup or something and I have my own

456
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,200
feedback process so I sometimes talk to

457
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,149
myself and say hey wouldn't it be cool

458
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:54,309
if it would do this thing and I didn't

459
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,260
just implement it

460
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,450
and this actually does make a huge

461
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,080
difference and also I just needed to

462
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,730
build something for life Jess otherwise

463
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:08,380
it would be pointless yeah and I would

464
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,470
like to if I will show you a little demo

465
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,780
of what this thing can do and I would

466
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,800
like to close with this quote who in

467
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,050
here knows where this quote is from

468
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,590
there are actually two places so anyone

469
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:30,070
knows this yeah no no no no it's it's

470
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,120
like it's it's in two pieces of music

471
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,310
like one quotes the other the other one

472
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,670
is a little bit older than the other one

473
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,560
interesting I thought like last time I

474
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,380
did this there were very like a lot

475
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,240
fewer people so I thought maybe this

476
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,430
time someone would get it so the

477
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,340
original the original quote is from Bob

478
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:57,670
Marley and let me get the song I have no

479
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,070
idea I need to look that up and then

480
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:06,760
it's been quoted by come on

481
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,350
it's bigger than hip hop here pop there

482
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:16,000
press write nice so and it actually

483
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,730
starts with that exact line one good

484
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,440
thing about music when it hits you feel

485
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,290
no pain and I just yeah I just love that

486
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,190
so let me give you a quick demo and then

487
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,930
I'm done and I'm going to attempt to

488
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,200
play this overhead so you're gonna you

489
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,910
can see it and that's going to be really

490
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:45,950
hard so forgive me if it sounds terrible

491
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,570
yeah I mean the the square I promised

492
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:55,870
you to take a look at so this is this is

493
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,950
Ableton

494
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,920
this is I'm using this in the background

495
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,320
just to generate the sounds because I

496
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,270
didn't want to bring

497
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,940
to again like additional to this heavy

498
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,530
beasts I didn't want to bring like five

499
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,390
to six synthesizers to make sense so

500
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,309
this is all done in software right now I

501
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:16,070
can do both this sounds better than

502
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,900
external synthesizers because it's

503
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,700
easier to build like this massive

504
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,150
collection of synthesizers and effects

505
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,370
so yeah this is what's going to generate

506
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,020
the sound but the whole sequencing

507
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,710
everything like you're gonna see on

508
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,870
comes from the other software and yeah

509
00:26:35,870 --> 00:27:02,000
it's going to be driven by this thing

510
00:27:02,010 --> 00:28:11,480
[Music]

511
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:18,230


512
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:50,020
[Music]

513
00:28:50,030 --> 00:29:03,459
[Applause]

514
00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:06,089
any questions

515
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:13,089
oh there yeah go ahead

516
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:16,169
good point the question was is this open

517
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:26,489
source let me answer that question wait

518
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:30,239
a second did I oh there you go

519
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:36,749
so yeah that's the github URL so yeah it

520
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:38,609
is open source if you want to take a

521
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:41,249
look at it it doesn't make any sense

522
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:43,199
without enabled and push right now I

523
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:45,059
really want to bring other controllers

524
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:46,619
to this as well because the push is

525
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,199
heavy to lug around and it would be nice

526
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,879
for conferences like this if I could

527
00:29:50,879 --> 00:30:03,769
just bring a smaller thing yeah yeah

528
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,629
it's a thing that is on NPM like always

529
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:08,130
but I wrote it

530
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:14,290
[Laughter]

531
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,750
so yeah so there's I mean there's Lib

532
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,179
USB but I actually like implemented the

533
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,730
whole data mangling to get it in the

534
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,360
right format and stuff like that yeah

535
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:36,570
yeah ah interesting point it like did I

536
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,870
ever use this with my beatboxing not

537
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,929
really so Ableton does have some looping

538
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:44,850
functions and I really would like to try

539
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,100
that out one time but the thing is that

540
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,530
I'm so nervous when I'm doing this life

541
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,890
music stuff every time that I don't

542
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,590
think that with an additional I don't

543
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,660
