1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,799

that's more than perfect thank you so

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,330
let's talk about like reading how do we

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,730
read and how the hell like how we can

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,100
help our users on internet to read

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,740
better and if I want to discuss this

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,590
topic it's because we all read like it

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,260
can be in books it can be in your couch

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,930
with a really nice atmosphere it can be

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,289
since doing a stage with vastly picture

10
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,160
but it's still reading or a bit less

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,309
pictures and both texts it's sometimes

12
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,890
about newspaper magazine just having a

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,329
really huge headache because of the news

14
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,579
we are also reading more and more on

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,210
screens all the kind of screens and

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,050
media and almost everywhere and that's

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,840
why I wanted to discuss with you today

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,039
reading because that's something we're

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,100
doing every day that's something that we

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,370
all are doing because even if we don't

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,769
want to you're reading advertisements in

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,010
the streets and usually we don't really

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,560
know how does it work

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,700
so hi Damien so really nice presentation

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,890
so we'll be really quick on that but my

26
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,689
twitter handle is I am evil oh and I

27
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,180
love Twitter at least I love discussing

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,189
with people on Twitter way easier than

29
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,830
face-to-face because in general I try

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,110
never to speak with people which is

31
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,820
today a bad example but like that's not

32
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,329
entirely true

33
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,619
I love discussing with people I'm just

34
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,060
really good at creating awkward

35
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,430
experiences with people really fun for

36
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,770
people more quad for me but you will see

37
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,259
that can be nice and I like just to do

38
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,020
some content warning so I'm using quite

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,790
a colorful language so please pardon my

40
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,159
french and there will be few videos

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,320
including one with really annoying sound

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,990
I'm really sensible to sound but I'm

43
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,149
really sorry in advance and usually my

44
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,950
sense of timing is really pretty pretty

45
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,500
bad so I will do my best to speak with

46
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,149
you about reading raccoons and Jack

47
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:03,780
Kurata

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,049
so buckle up it will be quite and quite

49
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,670
intense but let's talk about readability

50
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,060
and first why and the main reason why

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,700
it's because I can

52
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,970
I have a permit saying that I can do

53
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,800
what I want and today with you it will

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,650
be about a really complex cognitive

55
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,200
process which is readability really

56
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,730
complex because even if most of the

57
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,170
people are doing this since the youngest

58
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,050
age it's an acquired skill like you need

59
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,210
to learn to know how to read and it's

60
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,040
not something easy because you need

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,950
first to learn the alphabet and then you

62
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,680
need to learn what is this kind weird

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,230
mix of letters together that are words

64
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,940
you need to learn morphology orthography

65
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,270
semantics phonology and once you have

66
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,460
all of that you can start learning like

67
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,970
languages and the issue is that it's not

68
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,540
a life long skill like you can get you

69
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,730
can acquire reading difficulties like in

70
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,620
your life it's not something you will

71
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,040
keep like until your lecture last day

72
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,980
and the thing is the web is many

73
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,650
text-based and aside of the web being

74
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,780
mainly text-based add the debate on burn

75
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,560
on a burn but I'm sorry it will be burn

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,680
so the thing is the texts that are

77
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,110
composing our website that is the root

78
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,790
element of our website is not accessible

79
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,010
because not everybody can read it and

80
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,800
outside of reading impairments there is

81
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,140
one good example I'm not English speaker

82
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,850
in native so English for me was

83
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,470
something I had to learn I was in front

84
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,670
of a lot of website and not

85
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,320
understanding one word of what people

86
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,930
attend to me I hope that today is better

87
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,550
and I can hear my English and you can

88
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,959
understand English and not sure about

89
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,519
myself but we will try to see so reading

90
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,070
is really important and it's now also in

91
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,690
the way card so in the guidelines for

92
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,670
accessibility it's one of the success

93
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,180
criteria it's saying a lot of stuff

94
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,430
because we cog but mainly the

95
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,920
information here is the fact that it's

96
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,160
about text pacing and that's one awful

97
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,080
thing because if you're taking just the

98
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,850
accessibility guidelines and if you're

99
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,010
doing the CSS or the JavaScript for your

100
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,810
accessibility form to make your website

101
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,760
accessible the only thing you have to be

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,720
careful about is text pacing and

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,680
unfortunately there is a lot of studies

104
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,450
on dyslexia showing that we don't care

105
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,820
about we don't care so much about tech

106
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,350
spacing that's not the most important

107
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,419
element but still that's the only one we

108
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:27,230
can measure

109
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,420
so light heart space between paragraphs

110
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,880
space between words and space between

111
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,930
letters really important and before

112
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,690
going on CSS and the phones I just

113
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,130
wanted to see with you

114
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,600
why readability through dyslexia and one

115
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,830
of the reason why is because in

116
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,840
accessibility as usual the idea is

117
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,850
always to help the most impaired people

118
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,890
to be able to help everybody if you're

119
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,260
solving issues for the people having the

120
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,630
highest and the cap in front of some

121
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,200
actions you can help everybody so it's a

122
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,600
same with readability dyslexia is one of

123
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,240
the most common reading impairment it's

124
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,190
more or less 10% of the population

125
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,240
worldwide 10% of the population it's

126
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,580
huge and in some countries in Europe

127
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,130
it's even worse in a way like for

128
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,020
example Scandinavian languages because

129
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,020
of the really big amount of vowels and

130
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,980
like sounds in the language they are

131
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,200
like up to 15 to 17 percent of the

132
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,890
population it's really a lot and the

133
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,960
thing is you can try to find this like

134
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,910
sick child but it's not always inside

135
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,500
childhood too because when you learn a

136
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,360
new language you're facing your sounds

137
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,220
you're facing new things that you did

138
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,710
not know because not part of your first

139
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,140
or second or third languages and this

140
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,910
can trigger also some kind of dyslexia

141
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,910
and finally because this sixth it's not

142
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,670
only about reading it's about a lot of

143
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,440
stuff happening in your mind in your

144
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,390
cognitive processes mainly about

145
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,830
problem-solving and this is impacting a

146
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,330
lot of the way not only revision

147
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,050
internet but we just navigate so how do

148
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,170
we read them the first thing is the fact

149
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,280
that reading is not so much about the

150
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,250
text it's about the sounds that we make

151
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,000
it's about the reason that we are having

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,070
when we're speaking it's about the music

153
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,340
that we're creating so when we are

154
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,800
reading a text even just for self

155
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,080
we are always hearing a voice that's the

156
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,750
way our brain is trying to make sense of

157
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,210
a texts you are hearing it to understand

158
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,220
it to understand it and that's really

159
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,970
important because this voice will impact

160
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,760
sometimes even more than the word itself

161
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,070
and themselves like the feeling that you

162
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,290
will get from this text it will impact

163
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,420
the way you will understand it it will

164
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,330
impact a lot the way you will digest

165
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,780
this text so reading is mainly of

166
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,090
phonological process I love more than

167
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,450
three synapse like so phonological

168
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,280
basically means that it's the

169
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,710
association between a sound and the

170
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,400
meaning and that's how reading work so

171
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,560
basically like this when you're trying

172
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,360
to read there is like two different

173
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,000
voice in your head when trying to read

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,980
it and make it a loud one trying to

175
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,690
understand it and another one which is

176
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,870
the word around Eve trying to interrupt

177
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,680
all of that and if you need to create

178
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,210
this sound you need to take the words

179
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,630
and to make it a sound and for that

180
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,940
reading is using our eye but it's not

181
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,010
linear at all even if all our texts i

182
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,260
bet are based on lines it's not senior

183
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,810
at all because we're reading with a ball

184
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,760
like our eyes are kind of a ball so you

185
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,620
cannot really like move it easily with

186
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,660
six muscle on a line so we're doing

187
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,120
something called cycads so basically

188
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,800
when we are reading we're just jumping a

189
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,470
lot from places to places from group of

190
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,030
letters to other group of letters and

191
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,310
between each of the cycads we have

192
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,940
something called fixation so it's the

193
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,470
fact that we're stopping on a group of

194
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,180
letters before going to another one

195
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,000
and during this fixation it's the moment

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,830
where the reading experience is

197
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,470
happening so at this moment everything

198
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,120
is thought to be blurry around ookubo

199
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,450
feathers except the group of letter

200
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,550
itself so we are dancing like funerals

201
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,130
and all the shapes are round and that's

202
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,110
the reading moment and that's how we can

203
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,940
calculate the readability of a texts

204
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,700
usually i tracking counting the number

205
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,850
and length the duration of saccades and

206
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,060
the duration of fixation so it's less

207
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,339
about words that it is about staring at

208
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:39,260
screens and that's quite nice because

209
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,419
that's will that something we'll love to

210
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,480
do every day but it's like it's not real

211
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,400
about staring at screen it's essentially

212
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,190
about identifying shapes shapes of

213
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,200
paragraph with one more time do we care

214
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,130
because I hate as much as I love

215
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,009
despite these texts first we will like

216
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:59,649
look at the shape of a paragraph then

217
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,209
trying to find the different words

218
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:04,209
within the paragraph to identify more or

219
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,980
less what it is about and this is our

220
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,009
reading experience on string not linear

221
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,529
at all and that's why you can probably

222
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:17,130
read if despite the misspelling because

223
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,480
we don't care about the order of letters

224
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,360
we just want to recognize shapes as I

225
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,029
said to sound and this is happening

226
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,569
thanks to you letters identify features

227
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:28,769
letters

228
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,230
phones variable phones that's where the

229
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,300
link exists between the two things and

230
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,920
the I didn't think features it's

231
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,139
basically the top part and the lower

232
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,660
part of the word that can explain why we

233
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,199
can read more easily lowercase word than

234
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:47,500
uppercase and when you have mistakes

235
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,540
that's also why you can identify more

236
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,089
easily that bubble is problem and not

237
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:56,290
the awful blob of letters that is the

238
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,790
last one because it's about sound like

239
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,790
it's also like the change of letters

240
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,500
needs to happen in the sense that it's

241
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,720
part of the same syllabus it's them it's

242
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,389
part of the same group of sound and in

243
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:12,100
the two first ones we have the same

244
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,750
number of sounds that's in the last one

245
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,360
so that's how we can easily read text

246
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,439
despite installation I know it's really

247
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:23,370
early in the morning my brain hurts too

248
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:34,440
but here's something for you

249
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:41,649
I love trash pandas it's the nicest

250
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,079
thing ever

251
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:46,480
so what's the point of all of that the

252
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,930
point is like we need to design for

253
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,000
readability and we need also to

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,310
implement for readability and the best

255
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,139
way to learn it to look at airports

256
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:58,029
because they have to do that in a really

257
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:00,310
stressful environment which is a moment

258
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,959
where people just want to think about

259
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,699
the vacation just want to go in the

260
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:05,260
plane and don't want to do any

261
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,149
pathfinding and any game in the airports

262
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,699
so let's just take a look quickly at

263
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,230
what they're doing and the first thing

264
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,810
that they are doing its owning only one

265
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,990
phone face only one everything is

266
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,550
written with the same thing with the

267
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,370
same phone things and a series of

268
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,540
variations of ways this is really

269
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,120
helping for the like content charge and

270
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,250
also what they're doing it's not only

271
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,769
the way but it's really subtle but

272
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,529
they're playing with the tracking

273
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,310
between two letters like tteyuu is going

274
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,940
together so the two is way closer than B

275
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,360
and D for example so still one phone

276
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,850
face a series of different font wave and

277
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,500
different tracking and you can find this

278
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,410
consistency in the background with C Phi

279
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,680
which is also really close and way

280
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,089
closer that would be a C and E together

281
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:04,899
for example so basically that's what

282
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:07,540
they're doing it's readable it's

283
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,420
efficient that's great but can we do

284
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,319
better because it's static it's great it

285
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,140
works its efficient but it's not working

286
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,980
for everybody

287
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,250
first you need to speak English that's

288
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,079
something you need at least recognize

289
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,209
letters and numbers but also it's not

290
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,380
adapted to everybody some people don't

291
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,329
like the contrast between yellow and

292
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:36,069
black because it's really aggressive

293
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,810
it's one of the highest contrast you can

294
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,540
find great for readability not so great

295
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,390
for autistic people so some autistic

296
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,040
people so great but not cast

297
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,010
so can we do better ah the sound is not

298
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,390
there sorry

299
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,520
so yes I'm sorry

300
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,740
and yes we did because that's basically

301
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,700
what happened with with variable phones

302
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,790
it's not only we can do it like there is

303
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,700
now a way to do that with only one file

304
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,120
so variable font will help you doing

305
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,460
will help you do the extra mile and

306
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,640
doing like all the effort to go from

307
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,500
just offering a readable experience for

308
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
everybody to offering a way to customize

309
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,410
the experience for people and this is

310
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,120
important because accessibility is

311
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,230
really really really really hard and if

312
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,250
it's really hard because it's something

313
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,190
that you will never manage to do

314
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,000
entirely you cannot create a fully 100%

315
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,220
accessible solution like you have to do

316
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,950
at some moment choices between solutions

317
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,360
because not everybody's learned not

318
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,370
everything is compatible and because

319
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,779
there is no one fits all solution the

320
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:00,820
only way to be accessible if you do

321
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,510
customization and the creation of

322
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,959
accessible and inclusive experience is

323
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,520
something quite interesting because it's

324
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,490
about people quite interesting but it's

325
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,589
also about collaboration and

326
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:18,420
customization collaboration because

327
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,070
first we need to collaborate with our

328
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,290
users we need to understand their needs

329
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,450
we need to know that what we're doing is

330
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,480
meaningful for them but also because it

331
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,990
can help creating a lot of collaboration

332
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,010
between designers and engineers

333
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,330
everybody wants to do accessible on

334
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,770
accessible web like I never heard

335
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,510
someone saying yeah no I don't want to

336
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,290
like I don't care okay I don't care I've

337
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,110
heard it but nobody wants to do this on

338
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,660
purpose like being like I want to create

339
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,740
an inaccessible interface so usually the

340
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,260
gap between yeah I'm really interested

341
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,450
and I'm making accessible websites it's

342
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,640
not so much about skills because you can

343
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,100
learn

344
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,710
on internet it's more about discussions

345
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,590
on collaboration you need first to share

346
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,300
the same language between designers and

347
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,780
engineers because language is a really

348
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,300
root element to reality the best way to

349
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,010
share common reality between people is

350
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,980
to share some language and designers and

351
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,420
engineers don't really know anymore how

352
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,850
to discuss together but variable phones

353
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,960
can be a solution for that and also it's

354
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,030
a good way to customize experiences for

355
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,210
our users and to offer them the way to

356
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,420
do what they need to do to be

357
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,240
comfortable with what you're offering

358
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,430
and reading is really about this because

359
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,110
we have different we all have different

360
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,210
capabilities some people can read like a

361
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,650
whole book during the whole day without

362
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,260
any break just reading reading reading

363
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,910
reading reading if I'm starting reading

364
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,940
a book in 15 minutes I'm doing five

365
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,540
other stuff every time newspaper books

366
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,220
whatever I'm just doing five other stuff

367
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,750
at the same time so we all have

368
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,430
different capabilities attention span

369
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,500
but we also have different media that we

370
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,400
that we appreciate some people will only

371
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,890
read on screens if it's about with a Inc

372
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,860
for example like Amazon Kindle and all

373
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,320
kind of stuff other people really want a

374
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,930
book some people don't care it's like

375
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,000
different app ability is different media

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,130
and because we're all not read in the

377
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:29,060
same way so sorry medium sorry all the

378
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,530
website forcing you to read a lot of

379
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,980
content in one uniform way there is no

380
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,230
standard standard like readable

381
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,390
experiences and that's something you can

382
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,890
find in all the products in the markets

383
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,360
that you can like that you can use to

384
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,590
read some contents I have a really

385
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,290
strong hate for a MP but that's also

386
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,840
because while creating the web next to

387
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,660
the web there is medium trying to

388
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,330
recreate that this kind of like package

389
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,360
of readability like it's supposed to be

390
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,160
readable but not for everybody

391
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,080
there is solutions that will take the

392
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,880
content and offer it to you in a way

393
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,070
that is a bit more customizable and

394
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,710
that's sometimes it's quite nice because

395
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,300
you can at least find what you're more

396
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,270
comfortable with and there is

397
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,360
RSS feeds the website themselves and

398
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,829
assistive technologies that will adapt

399
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,420
entirely the content that you're

400
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,900
offering to the needs of the users and

401
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,579
basically variable phones will bring you

402
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,679
all over there with like the

403
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,750
customization possible for your products

404
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,900
and in a way if you have to see it this

405
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,200
way

406
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,559
it's basically viable phones are moving

407
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,360
more and more from the experimentation

408
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,059
stage to offering the same kind of

409
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,920
experience that we have with a font size

410
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,600
to go from size to girl are a bad idea

411
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,990
by the way just so so you we can stop

412
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,300
doing this because browsers can do that

413
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,850
and it's not the case with variable

414
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,920
phones like you cannot rely entirely on

415
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,380
browsers to do that because it's really

416
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,780
dependent on the fonts that you chose

417
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,450
and what are the different capabilities

418
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,090
so thanks for asking

419
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,190
Damian how do we implement such a thing

420
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,440
like should we give complete freedom to

421
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,020
our users and as usual when someone is

422
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,400
asking should we give complete freedom

423
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,920
to our users hell no hell no no no no no

424
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:28,820
never never never never never with

425
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,000
what's happening in here I'm a freedom

426
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
so viable like viable phones what is the

427
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,720
variable part of a viable phones the

428
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,950
variable part is in fact for access and

429
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,900
it looks like CSS and all the modern

430
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,840
capabilities really love access so here

431
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,230
we have like one which is maybe best

432
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,890
known so the weight of a font and here

433
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,500
you can play like with sorry with weight

434
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,470
and a value be like we'll value after

435
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,020
it's not revolutionary but it's quite

436
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,720
nice because the main difference is like

437
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,440
two main difference are first you have

438
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,170
only one file quite nice for performance

439
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,440
quite nice optimization but also you can

440
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,200
do really nice transitions there is no

441
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,410
jump from one state to the other there

442
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,580
is a really smooth

443
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,409
transition because it's based on vector

444
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:31,850
and you can easily go from one to the

445
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,140
other so wait the second one is width

446
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,740
and for this one it's something that

447
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,669
people love to play with in InDesign

448
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,309
that it can be really awful for the

449
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,049
readability but at the same time really

450
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:50,210
nice because you can basically expand

451
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,760
the weight of a letter but still keeping

452
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,250
something which is consistent which is

453
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,340
still designed to be like expanded in a

454
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,130
specific way even when it's really

455
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,830
condensed it's still readable I would

456
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,330
not advise going this condensed but

457
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,929
still it's readable and only working

458
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:11,240
with CSS and the same working with

459
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,659
transitions Roman versus italic but

460
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:19,970
please don't do Italy first because

461
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,519
readability is really impaired with

462
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:25,730
italic and also because usually most of

463
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,580
like most of the really cheap fonts that

464
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,380
we will find don't have a real italic

465
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,740
tetris-like slant the folks but quite

466
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,539
nice view too just for the optimization

467
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:39,320
part only one file during doing the

468
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,450
Roman and the italic here just no

469
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,500
transition and the last one because we

470
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,740
always need the last one you can slant

471
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,049
you can do some some slant like you can

472
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:58,669
change the the angle like the Dom the

473
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:01,639
degree of the fonts you can already do

474
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:03,740
that with rotation of each character

475
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,559
which is a pain but here the good thing

476
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,980
is that the baseline stay the same so

477
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,950
characters until are more and more

478
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,399
slanted but the line is still the same

479
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:19,789
so same here working with vectors really

480
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:22,880
nice for transitions and all of that is

481
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,289
working with one line of CSS which is

482
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,200
really not so difficult and in project

483
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,570
doing for example like projecting react

484
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,149
with style components assuming that we

485
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:38,120
can offer a full customization easily

486
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,039
thanks to this kind of solution based on

487
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:42,100
changing the value with JavaScript

488
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,610
so these are the foxes but as usual I

489
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,160
love adding a bit of bonus so there is a

490
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,370
bonus one it's not really an access but

491
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,240
kind of so it's the optical size the

492
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,360
optical size is a concept in in

493
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,690
topography which is really important we

494
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,540
completely lost it in font files in the

495
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,330
web we recreated it with having a lot of

496
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,970
different variation of font weight and

497
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,100
declaration in CSS and changing the

498
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,280
classes changing the declaration but now

499
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,410
we can do this just from a phone file

500
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,870
which means that the fonts can be only

501
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,430
one font again and fully adapted to what

502
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,730
we want the user to experience so this

503
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,130
can be really a great game changer for

504
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,140
the way we are loading phones and the

505
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,870
way we are doing performance because

506
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,850
only one file loading a bit of

507
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,590
everything

508
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,580
subsetting can be nice in this case to

509
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,460
not load everything but still one file

510
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,520
and you can set within this file a

511
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,570
variety of presets

512
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,630
preset like this so the optical size

513
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,290
it's a mix of everything it's the fact

514
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,100
that you can change the way you can

515
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,260
change like the space of characters you

516
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,240
can change how they behave we can change

517
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,220
the body of it you can change the sign

518
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,480
you can choose everything because

519
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,370
everything is based on vector and the

520
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,380
idea is the fact that the type designer

521
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,370
will set breakpoints like will CSS and

522
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,190
at specific breakpoints we will have a

523
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,050
different position for the vectors and

524
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,030
we can move easily from one to the other

525
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,890
and that's how we can recreate the kind

526
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,750
of layout that we have in magazine for

527
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,270
example because this is already existing

528
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,630
in CSS a lot it's in design system it's

529
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,490
what we call usually like the different

530
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,100
text variations bodies small tags

531
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,260
caption legend like all these kind of

532
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,580
things are different creative ways to

533
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,190
create different optical sights like if

534
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,750
we see the one made by Shopify supplies

535
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,420
as a design system you find it here

536
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,950
there is display small there is body

537
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,100
there is subheading

538
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,169
and all of that relying on only one font

539
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,340
so now thanks to this kind of

540
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,080
capabilities we can go from one font

541
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,380
with one star per different font way to

542
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:13,029
one song and one compile and that's

543
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:16,600
mainly for me how we can recreate

544
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,230
accessibility like features with this

545
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,049
kind of solutions for like with web

546
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:26,779
fonts like it's it's basically the best

547
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:28,759
way we can have now to propose an

548
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,129
experience where we can have like some

549
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:33,139
switcher some way to customize we can

550
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,669
let people going from one process to

551
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:37,519
another process like to have something a

552
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,049
bit like more build something a bit more

553
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:45,350
like with more ascendant with Madison we

554
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,970
can work on that and thanks to that

555
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,669
there is one linked bonus it's the same

556
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:55,100
more less but it's what it's offering us

557
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,159
it's offering us to define also custom

558
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,980
access optical size is what at the

559
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,669
beginning one custom acts so that's why

560
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,220
it's a bit linked but this can also

561
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,080
allow you to work with the designers to

562
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,789
create for example a variation for

563
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,960
dyslexic people because open dyslexic

564
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,490
open dyslexia is definitely not a

565
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,120
solution

566
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,220
in the sense of offering just this as a

567
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,750
relative is not working for this texting

568
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,549
people because it's targeting only a

569
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:24,769
really small part of the sexy people

570
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:26,450
they need to have like this kind of

571
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,210
optimization but you can just create

572
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,100
like a lot of different custom access

573
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,610
defined with four-letter tags and in

574
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,559
this case in accessibility you can ask

575
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,659
tech designers or you can try to work

576
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:39,919
with the type that you were designed

577
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,330
like that you were working with and

578
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,399
trying to merge all the phone together

579
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,080
like all the phone files together in

580
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,080
only one by working on three main axes

581
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,179
the first one is the asunder and des

582
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:52,789
under length the second one is the ball

583
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:55,570
size and the last one is the ball shape

584
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,269
so basically what does this it means

585
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:03,409
that you can change easily the length of

586
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:05,629
the the southern part and the a southern

587
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:08,000
part that also the weight of it and this

588
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,820
can reel

589
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,529
be helpful if you want to make the

590
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,350
experience more readable but you can

591
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,139
also play with the thickness of the ball

592
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:19,830
so on the B side although the main core

593
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,139
part of the letter and something you can

594
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:24,360
play with and that's the best way

595
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,049
usually for typefaces to be more

596
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:30,450
readable because if you make it if you

597
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,630
make the body a bit heavier and if you

598
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,169
make the most of the weight of it on the

599
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:39,720
baseline it's a good way for people to

600
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,509
make the difference between a b.a.p

601
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:45,600
energy especially if you also offer the

602
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,860
the idea of having a bit more lengthy

603
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,629
ascendant and ascendant because in this

604
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:52,950
case there is absolutely no confusion

605
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,110
between what's going up and what's going

606
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,289
down and you can play with almost any of

607
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:02,279
the variation so you can easily with

608
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,799
only one file move from like the regular

609
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,110
text that you would have to the one on

610
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,000
the top

611
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,809
same for serif versus Sun serif because

612
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:14,820
it's entirely based on vector it can

613
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,820
only be just a variation with the

614
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,200
optical size that you move from one to

615
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,840
the other and optical size are working

616
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,419
with like font size so you just have to

617
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,730
set for each font size which one do you

618
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,190
want to use we're gonna take another

619
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,870
crack at Whitman coming in there like

620
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,059
five times what are you gonna do annoy

621
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:41,960
him into talking haha

622
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,950
so I hope that I was not doing this with

623
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,500
you like just shouting for like almost

624
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,030
30 minutes in you hear this kind of

625
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,250
information because you can experiment

626
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,530
quite easily and you can have a better

627
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,720
success than Jack Peralta in this scene

628
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,420
and the way to experiment is basically

629
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,390
doing this like there is a fault that

630
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,430
you can use doing this and the variation

631
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,010
of the font size is helping to move

632
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,260
other font weight is helping to move the

633
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,690
horse for example but you can also do

634
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,670
this kind of things which are way more

635
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,580
useful because accessibility is not only

636
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,070
about how do we read but it can also be

637
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,350
about what is the thing that we get from

638
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,570
the texts for example like with

639
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,300
different text here we can have a

640
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,580
different feeling a feeling of anxiety

641
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,820
and we could also try to reduce anxiety

642
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,010
by providing different variation of

643
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,130
fonts so people can reduce the wave and

644
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,350
the emotional width of a font size for

645
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,540
example so these are the kind of changes

646
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,600
that you can do with only one file you

647
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,180
can also do color changes so if you have

648
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,610
like a website of or brand that are

649
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,740
using all full color that are not

650
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,110
accessible you can also rely on this to

651
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,960
change the branding and the logo first

652
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,760
of all the font in the logo to another

653
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,010
color based automatically on different

654
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,960
choices I know it's easier to change a

655
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,060
level but it's cool and one of the last

656
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,270
example it's this one it's the website

657
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,070
of a typography web typography

658
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,980
conference called unperson and all of

659
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,000
this is only one font file which in the

660
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,980
end is really amazing because the last

661
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,900
argument for one font file next

662
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,870
performance is it's only one from fair

663
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,390
to replace so all the people that rely

664
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,480
on replacing specific and main font file

665
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,150
in style sheets for accessibility reason

666
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,320
it means only one file replaced in these

667
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,540
websites to get a correct experience if

668
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,010
you cannot read the text over there so

669
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:48,190
Indian 3-3 small information if you're

670
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,850
really interested by experimentation in

671
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,140
variable phones I would really advise

672
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,880
you to follow

673
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,520
Davidge Jonathan Ross amazing type

674
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,710
designer doing a subscription model for

675
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,210
almost nothing and every month are

676
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,710
getting a new typeface that you can

677
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,770
experiment with but also what BBC

678
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,690
experimentation were because they played

679
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,460
a lot with this and that created some

680
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,550
really nice try and experiences on

681
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,310
variable fonts also on subtitles to see

682
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,530
how it can help making subtitles more

683
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,080
efficient and to visit V fonts calm

684
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,270
which is a listing of all the variable

685
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,010
forms that you can use at the moment

686
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,380
like bold well-known and access praxis

687
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,060
which is just a website giving you a lot

688
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,760
of information on in the end how does it

689
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,240
work

690
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,290
so one fun filter will demo so I hope

691
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,350
that you're ready to implement that and

692
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,190
thank you
