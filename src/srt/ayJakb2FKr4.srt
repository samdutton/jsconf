00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340

um yeah so my name's Brad Harris uh I

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,470
also work at Yahoo like Reed we work on

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,970
different different things and different

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,250
areas of the company but it was it was

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,620
fun when we found out that that there

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,480
were multiple people of us a yahoo both

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,889
using happy and in both in different

8
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,250
ways excited to speak with you guys

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,279
today I live in Denver Colorado I come

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,910
out here once in a while and this

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,439
weather kind of sucks but at least it's

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,750
not cold and snowy there's some contact

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,420
information about me but I've been

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,880
working at Yahoo for a couple years I

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,450
work I work mostly on different

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,149
publishing tools for both internal

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,219
partners of Yahoo and external partners

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,680
where we have different services that we

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,680
provide them and that often means like

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,270
creating some sort of an application for

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,610
them to access and and see how that

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,160
service is working for them and sort of

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,730
manipulate and interact with it as we

24
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,870
were building a few of these apps

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,520
recently there often just these

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,030
client-side applications or interacting

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,890
with some different services throughout

28
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,010
the company both old ones and new ones

29
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,130
and and as we we built a couple of them

30
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,409
we found that we were like using the

31
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,850
same services across multiple

32
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,130
applications and we tried a few

33
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,170
different ways of like sharing code

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,170
sharing modules to try and keep keep

35
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,939
that code this communicating a sort of

36
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,890
orchestrating that service communication

37
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,630
at least minimize and so we don't

38
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,350
duplicate it we ran into challenges with

39
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,060
with like sharing code and using modules

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,509
for that and we'll basically what we

41
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,829
settle on was like pulling all that

42
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,020
service orchestration and service

43
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,060
aggregation into its own dedicated layer

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,720
this middle tier and that's mostly what

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,100
I wanted to talk about today there's

46
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,049
been some awesome talks on like specific

47
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,240
things was happy whether it's features

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,259
how you use a certain thing or why why

49
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,750
choose happy so what I was what I was

50
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,399
hoping to talk about was pick a couple

51
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,590
things that we noticed once we once we

52
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,850
pulled all this like service

53
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,649
orchestration and aggregation out of our

54
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,689
client-side applications and gave it

55
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,520
like a real home that was dedicated to

56
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,709
it there were a few things that we

57
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:11,970
noticed that we weren't expecting

58
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,530
initially

59
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,940
so I picked a couple of those and

60
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,230
there's a ton of things you could talk

61
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,550
about but I picked a couple that I'm

62
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,500
hoping will be we be useful for some

63
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,060
people here to share those with you you

64
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,709
know aside from the inherit benefits

65
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,510
that you get from like pulling all of

66
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,750
that logic to to sort of normalize that

67
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,430
service communication out of your UI

68
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,590
they're really sees these things that we

69
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,180
I think you could have a whole talk just

70
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,890
on that about like how pulling that out

71
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,720
of your front end application and doing

72
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,580
it somewhere else has all these benefits

73
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,410
for you you I but that'd be a completely

74
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,870
different talk so I want to talk a

75
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,250
little bit about some of the benefits

76
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,950
that we saw so so when we build when we

77
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,560
build a lot of our applications you know

78
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,450
Yahoo's been around for a while so we're

79
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,269
building on on some existing services so

80
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,860
wanna see you buy a raise of hands how

81
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,300
many people out there have built like an

82
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,730
application a website something where

83
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,950
they got to build it on top of like

84
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,569
pristine services basically from the

85
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,209
ground up like they had no baggage no

86
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,120
legacy anything all right so you got

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,110
like maybe a quarter of the people here

88
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,459
and then how many people have had the

89
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,049
opposite where they built an application

90
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:23,760
website something and I've had to

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,320
interact with at least like one legacy

92
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,549
system it looks like about everybody and

93
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,610
that's kind of the the reality of

94
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,700
working for any any established company

95
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,590
or company that has been around for a

96
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,750
little while you're going to have to

97
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,280
interact with some legacy services

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,450
probably so I got a story so we were

99
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,359
working on this one this piece of our

100
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,489
application this new UI where we have

101
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,910
this this concept or this thing that a

102
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,739
user needed to interact with they needed

103
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:02,640
to create this thing and and so so we're

104
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,690
coming up with like what's the UI

105
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,070
supposed to look with look like for that

106
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,840
and it was like dead simples like we

107
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,400
need to collect one piece of info for

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,920
the user to create this thing so like

109
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,299
that was settled we knew what the you I

110
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,040
was supposed to look like we had to

111
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,870
prompt the user for this thing and we

112
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,150
started interacting with with a team

113
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,519
that was was handling these services for

114
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,430
us for this particular this particular

115
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,159
data structure that we needed to somehow

116
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,320
persist

117
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,640
so we talked with them and explain what

118
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,230
it is that we need it and they came back

119
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,790
said yeah we got something for that will

120
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,070
let me send you the schema for that so

121
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,250
they sent us this thing and we're like

122
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,520
really like this thing there's like 30

123
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,020
fields in it or something we only need

124
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,220
like one of them and they're like well

125
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,900
this is how you have to persist this

126
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,720
thing because of things like you have to

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,990
save it this way I'm I'm taking some

128
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,390
creative liberties a little bit with the

129
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,170
story but but the gist of it was like we

130
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,180
had a very simple thing that we needed

131
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,330
we needed from a UI perspective and all

132
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,070
son got like very complicated once we

133
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,670
needed to interact with these services

134
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,880
so so we were thinking like you know

135
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,350
there's a lot of ways to handle that you

136
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,440
can build like a very simple sort of

137
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,630
mapping layer in your UI to try and

138
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,250
create an abstraction it makes sense for

139
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,800
the UI but then converts it to something

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,510
like this or whatever it is that you

141
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,050
need when you when you talk to that

142
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,820
service initially that's sort of a path

143
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,690
that we took but like as we had that

144
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,250
like that mapping layer or that

145
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,900
abstraction we were trying to do it in

146
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,970
the UI like it just feels fake because

147
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,550
it's like right there next to it it

148
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,100
didn't feel like like it was a real

149
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,419
abstraction and and I as we got into it

150
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,070
it actually ended up being that we had

151
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,890
like two different UI concepts that both

152
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,840
like needed to be persisted in the same

153
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,190
data structure in slightly different

154
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:02,250
ways so that that's where like we found

155
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,310
we found this benefit of like creating

156
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,870
these tailor-fit abstractions for our

157
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,180
you is so in one case like we had two

158
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,570
different data structures for our you is

159
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,490
that that were like exactly what we

160
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,960
needed for the UI no more no less and

161
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,970
and creating those you know those

162
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,770
abstractions and putting them in this

163
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,860
middle tier it had an interesting effect

164
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,900
because like as soon as you have like a

165
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,840
set of dedicated routes to something you

166
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,150
know an actual model that represents it

167
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,180
so a set of these resources dedicated to

168
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,950
the subtraction like it becomes more

169
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,740
real for some reason

170
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,509
and the you I can treat it that way and

171
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,160
it's not it's you know it's it's a it's

172
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,240
a lot harder to sort of budget and just

173
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,949
you know let the abstraction leak into

174
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,930
what that big huge thing was that that

175
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,520
you really want to kind of hide from

176
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,729
your UI so but that doesn't come without

177
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,500
overhead like as you create you know you

178
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,729
want to create all these abstractions

179
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:00,490
that are tailored fit for your UI

180
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,020
there's overhead of like creating routes

181
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,360
and then having to maintain those you

182
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,530
know you want to make sure that they're

183
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,569
validated correctly and I think that's

184
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,280
where like some of the stuff that's been

185
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,470
talked about earlier that Regis talked

186
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,240
down with joy like it makes it really

187
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,069
easy and cheap to do a lot of that stuff

188
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,530
you can even at the end of each stock

189
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,020
had talked about sharing schemas you can

190
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,669
share schema so you avoid some of that

191
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:25,190
duplication some of that overhead to

192
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,889
maintaining that stuff so that was one

193
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,569
thing that we did that we found was

194
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,830
really helpful that we weren't really

195
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,720
anticipating that once we created this

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,759
dedicated middle tier we'd have a place

197
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,830
to create these abstractions that you

198
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,630
know didn't necessarily exist in some of

199
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,909
the services we were calling but but

200
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,560
they became feasible for our front end

201
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,750
and that had some great great side

202
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,389
effects the other thing that we thought

203
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:54,979
we noticed so as we were like building

204
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:56,930
up these these applications and talking

205
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,659
to different services like not all

206
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,090
services are created equal like some of

207
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,180
them some of them you know use status

208
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,130
codes for for how you can detect whether

209
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,539
there was an error whether it did what

210
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:10,669
you wanted it to do some of them send

211
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,530
you JSON and it's like you know in a

212
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,940
great format that you can look at some

213
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,740
property some of them send you some

214
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,509
string that maybe you have to like match

215
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:19,550
patterns against and some of them

216
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,960
sometimes send you nothing and that

217
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,819
means it worked or sometimes they send

218
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,229
you nothing for a different route that

219
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,419
means it didn't work and these are all

220
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,849
examples of like something that we have

221
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:30,590
right now any services that we've talked

222
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,940
with that that we've had to go through

223
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,219
so you know for your UI like if you have

224
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,169
to normalize all that in the UI it's not

225
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,270
only like extra code but it's like it

226
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,529
just becomes a mess and you have to

227
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:45,920
maintain it it becomes very buggy so so

228
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,570
it's an obvious thing to move to this

229
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,089
middle tier and to normalize all those

230
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,949
crazy services so you have like one

231
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,510
consistent output

232
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:04,900
or for you you I oops went too far so

233
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,820
and happy has modules that make that

234
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,560
really easy that you know we've talked

235
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,450
about or I don't know if booms been

236
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,730
mentioned but boom like I used to hate

237
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,470
status codes and I built api's in the

238
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,440
past in the past and I always hated like

239
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,450
trying to figure out which I wish status

240
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,770
code am I supposed to use how can I make

241
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,360
sure that like everybody is returning

242
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,860
the right status code at the right time

243
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,580
that were consistent across our API and

244
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,950
boom makes that pretty easy like in

245
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,870
English that people can understand when

246
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,430
you're doing code reviews is pretty

247
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,440
obvious like whether it's doing the

248
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,440
right thing there but we had like we had

249
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,090
these existing front end applications

250
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,800
that were expecting a certain payload

251
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,770
structure of Jason does anyone heard of

252
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,270
Jace and not a lot of people just me all

253
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,190
right there's not a whole lot to it it's

254
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,160
just like a JSON structure that's a

255
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,140
convention for how to send messages back

256
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,270
and forth with certain properties so we

257
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,740
had these you is that were already built

258
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,010
and sort of anticipating that structure

259
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,080
so it was really easy to just tap into

260
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,510
the hooks too happy provides with angry

261
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,110
use the on pre response hook to take

262
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,000
whatever that structure was and then

263
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,580
take like a boom response and then

264
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,440
convert it into something that that was

265
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,450
what our you eyes were expecting which

266
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,580
was this thing and you know did

267
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,440
converting like these four hundred

268
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,810
errors into into failures and 500 into

269
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,510
22 errors and then leaving some

270
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,650
additional properties that we didn't

271
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,550
have before that were helpful but not

272
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,660
that I think that'll be super helpful

273
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,280
for anyone else if you are using James

274
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,140
send which it sounds like nobody else is

275
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,170
out here it could be helpful but it just

276
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,300
for me was it was nice to see how easy

277
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,710
it was it just happened to that hook

278
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,840
well inspect the response we're getting

279
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,880
back it was really easy to see if it was

280
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,410
an error because I was like in is boom

281
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,230
property and then handle it accordingly

282
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,090
and convert it into what our you guys

283
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,450
were expecting and it's something that

284
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,160
if we migrate and change our you eyes

285
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,600
like it's really easy to pull that out

286
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,310
and just leave stuff as as

287
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,320
sort of with vanilla boomers and their

288
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,220
responses so more than anything what

289
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,650
what I'm hoping you get out of this if

290
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,180
you got something out of this other than

291
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,610
the ten-minute nap is that you'll

292
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,770
consider like this middle tier of your

293
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,570
application and like that doesn't

294
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,240
necessarily mean you have an actual like

295
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,670
dedicated layer or dedicated service

296
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,260
like that middle tier if you're talking

297
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,390
with services is probably somewhere and

298
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,250
it might even be in your UI code it

299
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,350
might be through like your UI code to

300
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,330
your node server for your front end like

301
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,310
sprinkle through several places but

302
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,350
consider that and if it's becoming like

303
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,380
hard to consume and manage like try to

304
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,940
try you know think of some of these

305
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,040
things and consider moving it to a

306
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,050
dedicated middle tier one of the things

307
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,120
that we found really helpful for I guess

308
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,760
we hired new engineers when it was all

309
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,529
in one application where is this one UI

310
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,930
that was like you know all the UI code

311
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,520
the front-end code also talking to all

312
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,200
the services it was a lot to bite off

313
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,200
and consume and sort of grok for for new

314
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,120
hires but when you could like break that

315
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,160
out into its own layer and then let

316
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,900
people ease into it as they were

317
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,880
starting to get everything became a lot

318
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,490
easier to maintain so give your your

319
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,810
middle tier the attention that it

320
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,450
deserves it's probably somewhere in your

321
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,610
application already so look for ways

322
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,780
that you can use some of these tools

323
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,390
that the happy ecosystem provides to try

324
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,890
and give it that attention the desserts

325
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,020
make it something beautiful like that

326
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,170
that you can manage and just eat it and

327
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,170
enjoy it one of the things that I really

328
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,820
appreciate about happy is like the

329
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,450
effort that let's put in to making it

330
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,850
very modular it's not just one library

331
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,420
it's it's a series of libraries that you

332
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,370
know like reads that you might use joy

333
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,720
for something that has nothing to do

334
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,790
with HTTP so it's great that there's

335
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,100
these these suite of tools that are like

336
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,300
heavily tested and sort of proven that

337
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,950
the end they work well together but you

338
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,150
don't necessarily have to use them

339
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,830
together so as you sort of give your

340
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,880
middle tier the attention it deserves

341
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,860
like some of the tools that happier

342
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,870
provides whether you use happy like as

343
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,940
an HTTP server or not there's probably

344
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,589
something in that ecosystem that will be

345
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:15,080
a benefit to you and then there's some

346
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,910
cats and warm fuzzies because everybody

347
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,350
likes cats i'm not really a cat person

348
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,000
but i thought if i showed cats you guys

349
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,020
would like my talk

350
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,500
and like me a little bit anyways all
