[Applause]

11
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:34,270
I am trying to produce music I think it

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,710
took me two years to produce two tracks

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:43,000
one of them is listenable okay so we are

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,100
here today and I'm going to talk about

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,310
how we can be allies by creating

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,850
accessible react apps my name is Neha

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,010
nivedita I'm a software engineer with

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,870
node experts which is a global

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,550
consulting firm based out of New Delhi

20
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,670
that creates custom web apps for clients

21
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,049
big and small on nodejs react Express

22
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:09,310
MongoDB you know the whole shebang so

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,200
let's begin oh yeah i'm also on twitter

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,110
at nick nevada the few one of let's take

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,640
a look at what we'll be discussing about

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,600
today could I have the confidence

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:38,240
monitor please

28
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,210
sorry about this I'll just continue

29
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,390
speaking off of the screen so we will

30
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,399
talk about what accessibility is why we

31
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,250
need it what kind of problems we face

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,970
when we try to implement things in gs

33
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,740
frameworks what accessibility issues

34
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,399
occur there

35
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,100
how react works and how we can make our

36
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,110
react apps accessible then we'll spend a

37
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,360
little bit of trying talking about the

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,259
importance of colors and react

39
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,119
accessibility tools and unit testing in

40
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,319
those before we proceed further on this

41
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,850
I just want to point out that this talk

42
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,250
is meant to be a primer only it's

43
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,560
basically an amalgamation of what I have

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,260
learnt so far in a short amount of time

45
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,540
about accessibility in react it should

46
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,340
help guide you on your way if you are

47
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,819
trying to do similar things in react it

48
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:32,319
may not be perfect none of us are but I

49
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,430
hope it helps you oh and one more thing

50
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,290
how many of us were here yesterday for

51
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,890
just insoles talk the one with seven 25

52
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,070
slides in 30 minutes I just want to say

53
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,810
that it makes me really happy to see

54
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,730
that we are at a conference where we

55
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,660
have live captioning and an amazing team

56
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,670
of people at white-coat captioning would

57
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,350
do that I just want to have a big round

58
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,350
of applause for our awesome heroes who

59
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,359
have been working very hard to make sure

60
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:06,579
that this conference is accessible and

61
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:09,730
on top of that you know dealing with

62
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:16,380
just ensures brilliant brutal talk okay

63
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,100
proceeding from here what's

64
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,220
accessibility and why do we need it

65
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,970
everyone should be able to access any

66
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,750
service or product regardless of their

67
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,400
ability or disability this is a fact

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,359
there should be equality about this so

69
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,030
far when we think of accessibility how

70
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,709
many different kinds of accessibility

71
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,050
can we think of physical

72
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,010
like when people who cannot walk they

73
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,939
need wheelchairs right so this is a form

74
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,980
of accessibility that they should have

75
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,110
they should be able to go anywhere they

76
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,180
should have wheelchair ramps they should

77
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,640
have buses that are able to pick them up

78
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,319
similarly we have accessibility when it

79
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,269
comes to web as well people who cannot

80
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,189
see or cannot hear should be able to use

81
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:13,459
web apps just as well as those of us who

82
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,349
can see and hear

83
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,229
so that's web accessibility related to

84
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:23,030
web services products and apps web

85
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,380
accessibility is governed by a set of

86
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,289
features and guidelines that help design

87
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,539
your app to be fully usable by people

88
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,030
with disabilities some of these tools

89
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,949
include screen reader support photo

90
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:37,310
captioning and keyboard usability let's

91
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,740
look at a few terms that are associated

92
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,449
with web accessibility a11y it is

93
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,090
pronounced like this a 1:1 by or a 11 by

94
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,460
although since I'm a terrible punster I

95
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,460
decided to name my talk how to be an

96
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,560
ally I like doing that I like hitting

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,000
people with puns sometimes all the time

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,880
then we have Bach AG WCAG that's web

99
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,490
content accessibility guidelines these

100
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,510
are the rules set for how we should

101
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,510
develop any application so that it is

102
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,940
accessible to everyone the third thing

103
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,470
that we need to look out for is aria

104
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,240
it's accessible rich Internet

105
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,580
applications these are features baked

106
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,729
into HTML that enable any app to be

107
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:24,880
accessible to people

108
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,180
stats 15% of the population has some

109
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,430
form of disability if we take a look at

110
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,620
it and cold hard numbers that's almost 1

111
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,860
billion people that that's how many 15%

112
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,030
is now 8% of the population is also

113
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,580
color blind just trying to think about

114
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,539
all of these numbers if you try to think

115
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,690
of exactly how many people are we

116
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,490
excluding if we are not making sure that

117
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,229
our app is accessible that's 1 billion

118
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,300
15% of the population and out of

119
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,220
8% being colorblind the monitor is off

120
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,460
again if we are excluding 15% of our

121
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,069
users then we are failing at our jobs as

122
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,229
developers I'm sure some of us have

123
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:16,039
heard this before accessibility is not a

124
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,690
feature it is a necessity if by design

125
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,080
we are excluding a vast number of our

126
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,030
users then we are actively

127
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,340
discriminating against them and this is

128
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,319
wrong this is unfair it should not

129
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,099
happen therefore if we are excluding

130
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:36,080
these many uses we are failing our jobs

131
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,919
and this should not happen I'm trying to

132
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,050
work on that myself I did not know

133
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,469
excessive about accessibility for a long

134
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:49,129
time but now I'm trying to learn so this

135
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:52,759
is what I'm here for today accessibility

136
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,500
will ensure that our app is usable by

137
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,840
persons with disabilities today's talk

138
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,479
is mainly going to focus on screen

139
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,759
readers and color blindness not so much

140
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,150
about people who are deaf unfortunately

141
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,469
we don't have enough time for that but

142
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:10,250
let's see so what kind of issues occur

143
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,400
when we are using J's frameworks like

144
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,250
frameworks like react they typically use

145
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,029
syntactic sugar to create apps syntactic

146
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:22,849
sugars are syntactic sugar means that

147
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,460
they are not pure HTML due to this

148
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,960
developers sometime end up writing

149
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,529
non-semantic HTML now tools like screen

150
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,629
readers are not able to parse

151
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:36,289
non semantic content meaningfully what

152
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,900
does this mean this means that people

153
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,849
who are disabled who are using those

154
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,400
screen readers to understand the content

155
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,289
on your web page they are not able to

156
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:46,909
get any meaning out of it they are not

157
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:49,490
able to use it your app has become

158
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,430
inaccessible let's take a look at how

159
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,840
this happens this is something that I'm

160
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,460
sure a lot of us are guilty of I know I

161
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,599
am 10 times over this piece of code is

162
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,940
supposed to be a button made out of a

163
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,650
div how many of us have done this quite

164
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,740
quite a few of us right so what happens

165
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,870
is that when a screen reader encounters

166
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,230
this

167
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,320
for code it fails to read it out loud as

168
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,970
a button because it doesn't understand

169
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,360
that it's a button it sees a div and

170
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,650
something inside it that's it that's all

171
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,080
it sees this way the user is not aware

172
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,470
that what they are trying to look at is

173
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,100
actually a button so if we try to look

174
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,440
at it this way you could say the verdict

175
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,460
is that because of JavaScript frameworks

176
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,270
these frameworks are killing

177
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,940
accessibility but it doesn't have to be

178
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,260
like this let's take a pause on that

179
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,930
thought and think about how react works

180
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,740
react works with dome and virtual dome

181
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,000
changes whatever changes we want to

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,130
happen in the app they occur in the

183
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,350
virtual dome and the reactor econ Seiler

184
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,790
compares the difference between what is

185
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,460
already there on the screen and what the

186
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,380
changes are supposed to be and updates

187
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,580
those differences on the actual dome

188
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,370
this is an example of react JSX it looks

189
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,280
like HTML but it's not HTML it has a

190
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,350
label but then it has certain attributes

191
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,690
that are written in camelcase you can

192
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,230
pass values to it so this is this looks

193
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,340
like HTML might be react GSX is then

194
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,010
converted into pure HTML and rendered in

195
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,210
the dome just like that so if we try to

196
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,800
think about this we can say that

197
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,420
essentially whatever code we are going

198
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,610
to write it is going to turn into HTML

199
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,160
at some point it's going to be plain old

200
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,420
HTML so if we start writing some Mantic

201
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,480
HTML our code can by default be good

202
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,320
with accessibility so if any of us have

203
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,330
been holding on to the excuse that hey

204
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,550
look I'm a reactive I'm an angular

205
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,860
therefore accessibility is hard for me

206
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,950
no it's not it doesn't have to be yes it

207
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,280
will take some effort but we can do it

208
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,200
react supports Aria natively so

209
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,780
therefore user property right could

210
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,330
react code then you get good HTML code

211
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,580
if you get good HTML code then you have

212
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,829
better accessibility simple as that

213
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,980
how to make our react app accessible I'm

214
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,250
going to take you through a series of

215
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,810
several types of actions that we can

216
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,449
take to do this

217
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:33,610
react provides several features that

218
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,220
make accessible design possible first of

219
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,320
all before we begin on that we need to

220
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,579
make sure that we get the long

221
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:41,110
low-hanging fruit out of the way first

222
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,920
if you are if you are if you need to

223
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,570
show an image make sure that it has an

224
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,639
alt attribute all the attributes are

225
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,510
important to screen readers do not make

226
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,010
a button out of something that is not a

227
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,660
button don't use dips for that don't use

228
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,760
anchor tags I'm going to keep coming

229
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,110
back to this point again and again until

230
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,540
I'm sure that we've got it right

231
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,589
semantic HTML let's take a look at the

232
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:08,019
core accessibility features we can focus

233
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:11,410
on setting page titles setting page

234
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,600
title is important for several reasons

235
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,050
in a single page application like react

236
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,139
the page may update we may go to a

237
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:23,050
different route but then that page title

238
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,800
remains the same this creates problem

239
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,589
because the page title is the first

240
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,300
thing that screen readers usually read

241
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,940
out now if a screen reader isn't reading

242
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,459
out that difference then user may not be

243
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:39,250
aware that something has changed that we

244
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,339
are at a different location so let's

245
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:45,339
update our page title in a react app we

246
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,990
can do it simply like this we can update

247
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,060
the document or title inside our

248
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,420
component dead mount lifecycle method

249
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,740
simple as that or we could use some

250
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,930
plugins for it there there is react

251
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,790
document title that does the same thing

252
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,130
you wrap this component around whatever

253
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,899
content you want to render and provide

254
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,199
it a page title or you could reuse react

255
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,790
helmet it's a this is a very useful

256
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,889
plug-in that is used not just for

257
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,420
setting page titles but also for

258
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,709
basically setting anything that you want

259
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:19,300
to on that pages HTML head you can

260
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,389
include meta tags in it so it's very

261
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:27,329
useful for SEO as well header semantics

262
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:32,190
so some of us may have used head

263
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,560
in ways they were not supposed to be

264
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,480
used how many of us have used headers

265
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,810
just to set something like font size

266
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,029
some of us make sure that you're using

267
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:51,290
headers the way they are meant to

268
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,209
headers basically define the structure

269
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:57,540
of your content where sections are

270
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,370
supposed to be which is a subsection and

271
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,370
so on and so forth the top header should

272
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,490
always be H 1 followed by n h2 and then

273
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,120
NH 3 don't try to use headers if if what

274
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,699
you're looking for is font size and CSS

275
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,860
never do that

276
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,920
if you did that in your school homework

277
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,779
for English your teacher wouldn't

278
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,120
approve so no need to do that now you

279
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,350
can also create configurable header

280
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,959
component like this you can pass it

281
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,360
content as well as level of the header

282
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,000
and it will spit out the current the

283
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,550
correct header tag you can also

284
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,500
configure it to return next level header

285
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,319
programmatically unique IDs unique IDs

286
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:45,529
are again important for screen readers

287
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,959
because they specify exactly what

288
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,310
element a screen reader is focused on to

289
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,500
generate unique IDs you could use

290
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,510
something that comes from a database or

291
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,540
you could use a library like UID to

292
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,930
generate unique strings so that the

293
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,399
screen reader knows exactly where

294
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,350
element is supposed to be and your user

295
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,240
is able to parse through your content

296
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,339
meaningfully react fragments react

297
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,860
fragments they were introduced and react

298
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,740
16 a while back they are used to group a

299
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,600
list of elements without adding extra

300
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,589
notes with doom

301
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:25,439
they do a very useful thing in that they

302
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:28,250
get rid of x value drop Odom's

303
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,779
let's take a look at how we used to

304
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,339
export certain components that had

305
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,259
sibling elements but nothing wrapping

306
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,949
them we would have to add an invalid

307
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:42,930
empty wrapper div around it just to

308
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,649
export it as a single

309
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:48,100
now if we did this on something like a

310
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,459
list item or a subset of list items if

311
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:56,290
we try to expose that it would it would

312
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,760
not come out in a way that was

313
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,620
semantically correct they aren't

314
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,329
supposed to be any divs inside an

315
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,510
unordered list unless they're inside the

316
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,790
list item so what to do about this use

317
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,480
fragments since react 16 you can use

318
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,990
react fragment to wrap such items and

319
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,260
export them so when this renders in the

320
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,829
dome it is not bound by any empty

321
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:26,290
useless invalid wrapper lives your code

322
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,230
is semantic perfect and ready to be read

323
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,040
by a screen reader change announcements

324
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,560
what a change announcements in react app

325
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,050
since react is dynamic things may be

326
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,680
updating at any section of the page

327
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,089
without being picked up by the screen

328
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,449
reader this creates a problem when

329
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,949
something is changing we want the user

330
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:54,160
to be aware of it for this we can create

331
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,029
a simple component that makes use of the

332
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:01,170
aria-live attribute what is aria-live do

333
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,740
whenever the underlying content of an

334
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,769
HTML element with the aria-live tag

335
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:12,930
changes it announces that content again

336
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,529
so here we are doing something that

337
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:20,529
basically creates an simple empty

338
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:22,779
component that can be put anywhere in

339
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:25,810
our app inside it we can put a message

340
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,779
at firstly message can be empty and when

341
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,370
we want the announcer to announce

342
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,199
something we can simply pass it some

343
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,540
message since it has the aria-live

344
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,370
attribute the screen reader will pick

345
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,459
this up and announce it you can see that

346
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,110
the aria-live value right now is polite

347
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,420
which means that the screen reader will

348
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,360
wait until any other announcements have

349
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,230
been finished to announce this one aria

350
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,560
atomic true means that whenever any part

351
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,720
of the content inside this component

352
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,610
changes it will announce the

353
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,040
tire thing all over again how to use

354
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,709
this in any parent component have a

355
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,360
value in the state like message at first

356
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,030
it's empty its null then when some event

357
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,920
occurs certainly state to what you

358
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,350
wanted to be like professor utonium i'd

359
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,900
say element x has been added by mistake

360
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,370
but whatever it will create the

361
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,299
Powerpuff Girls so this value can then

362
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:25,000
go into the announcer by the state and

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,230
whenever the value changes we can the

364
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,030
screen reader will pick this up and

365
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,580
announce it pretty simple but very

366
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,580
useful there are other components like

367
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,559
this as well that you can use this react

368
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,410
aria-live and react accessibility

369
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,510
announcer both of these do the same

370
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,490
thing there's also something called

371
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,020
react portal that was recently

372
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,950
introduced react portal is something

373
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,080
that is not exactly part of your current

374
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,410
react dome but you it is outside of it

375
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,000
but you can still access whatever values

376
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,890
inside it so this could be potentially

377
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,299
used for a for an announcer as well

378
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,400
focus in life focus is important this is

379
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,679
what I've been told many times by my

380
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,559
parents by my teachers by some friends I

381
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,169
never used to listen to them I'm

382
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,500
terrible at being focused but this is

383
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,660
again very important when it comes to

384
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,150
accessibility

385
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,650
what does focus do when a page loads and

386
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,820
we want some element to be focused by

387
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,830
default that that thing is important

388
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,210
when we're dealing with Jace's JS

389
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,510
frameworks like react react so far has

390
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,000
silent routing that means that when the

391
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,390
route changes nothing much happens the

392
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,220
browser doesn't refresh so keyboard

393
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,750
focus doesn't really know where to go by

394
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,790
default so you need to manage it on your

395
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,929
own for this you can use refs don't

396
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,049
overuse the refs use them judiciously

397
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:05,400
but for managing focus you can use them

398
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,309
since react 16.3 using refs has been

399
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:11,330
more straightforward and easier

400
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,600
you can use them like this for any

401
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,800
component you can create ref using react

402
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,080
dot create ref as you can see in the

403
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,910
constructor over there we have a ref

404
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,710
called section header and then in my

405
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,620
render section we I have a h3 compete

406
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,340
tag which I want to be focused so what

407
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,460
I'll do is that I'll attach this ref to

408
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,800
the h3 tag next on when this component

409
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,950
mounts I want the focus to go to that

410
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,710
particular ref so what will I use I will

411
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,540
use a component ded mount method and I

412
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,010
look for that particular ref section

413
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,160
section header and use dot focus to make

414
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,110
sure that when this component is mounted

415
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,560
that header is being focused now when

416
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,810
the screen reader notices that this

417
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,370
particular component has the focus it

418
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,830
will read out its content and it will be

419
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,590
easier for the user to know where they

420
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,000
are like we discussed earlier let

421
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,810
button's be buttons for God's sake

422
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,580
always remember this again this is not

423
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,870
just about buttons this could be about

424
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,680
any element in HTML try to use semantic

425
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,240
hTML as much as possible

426
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,180
don't try to repurpose some other some

427
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,570
type of HTML tag for something it was

428
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,720
not meant for use anchor tags for links

429
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,000
use button for buttons use tables if you

430
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,900
need to that example that we saw earlier

431
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,420
the button with the made out of Dave

432
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,780
don't do that use a button attach an

433
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,780
onclick handler to it if you want it to

434
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,890
look like something else if you want

435
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,500
your button to look like anchor tag you

436
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,040
CSS for it but don't use anchor tag to

437
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:08,600
make it next let's talk about SVG's SVG

438
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,970
is by default they are not passed

439
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,090
properly by screen readers but still

440
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,430
SVG's are better than PNG is if you want

441
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,920
to use icons this is especially

442
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,050
important for people with low vision who

443
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,580
might need to zoom

444
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,940
on the screen to see to read what's in

445
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,679
there

446
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,769
now since SVG scale better if if you

447
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:33,950
zoom in on it it won't break it won't

448
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:39,010
blur it won't be what's it called

449
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,909
basically you can understand what's in

450
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:43,250
there but with some PNG is if we zoom in

451
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,779
too much you might not be able to see

452
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,220
what's in there you might not be able to

453
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,360
understand it it's too blurry so how to

454
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,850
make SVG's accessible you can use the

455
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,549
title and description tags that are

456
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:58,010
supported by SVG screenreader do read

457
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,960
this out so make sure you have this

458
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,090
whenever you're using SVG here is an

459
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,830
example of how to do it I think I picked

460
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:10,250
it off so this SVG has a title and

461
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,690
description screen reader will read it

462
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,490
out and the user will be able to

463
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,120
understand what they're looking at

464
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,539
context is key context is super super

465
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,639
important no matter what you're doing

466
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:24,289
where you are especially so in

467
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:27,200
accessibility take a look at this icon

468
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,750
over here it's a common enough icon it's

469
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,659
across sometimes it means close

470
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:36,139
sometimes it means delete you need to

471
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:38,450
specify exactly what the purpose of that

472
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,880
icon is in the context you're using it

473
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,769
if you don't do that you know it's like

474
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:50,179
Apple and Apple one of those is super

475
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:53,149
popular the other one manufactures fancy

476
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:59,210
laptops right so make sure you specify

477
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,190
the context when you're using icons be

478
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,580
it SVG PNG whatever add custom titles

479
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,440
whenever you you can to provide

480
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,039
contextual info to screen readers and

481
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,679
make sure that you can do this for any

482
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:15,909
type of element you should know this

483
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:19,519
next colors are important that can also

484
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,830
be a problem typically when we design

485
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,720
our web apps we put a lot of stock in

486
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,600
colors hey it's green right that means

487
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,850
success that means say it's red that

488
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,500
means error

489
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,559
it means delete blue is for info or for

490
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,380
update the problem begins to have

491
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,960
when we begin to rely solely on colors

492
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,960
to provide meaning that should not

493
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,440
happen because colorblind people are

494
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,060
going to have a very very very tough

495
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,400
time there with it you don't want to

496
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,370
trouble them so much another type of

497
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,250
problem that occurs when we are using

498
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,490
the wrong colors is when there's less

499
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,810
contrast people with low vision cannot

500
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,090
differentiate between two colors that

501
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,370
are of same hue and the contrast between

502
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,670
them is very less so you might think

503
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,880
that you have a very visible pale red

504
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,170
background and dark red foreground but

505
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,910
someone with low vision may not be able

506
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,700
to see anything on that screen you don't

507
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,460
want that to happen so choose your

508
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,040
colors white wisely and try not to put

509
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,220
too much talk or too much meaning into

510
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,710
be colors sure use that but make sure

511
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,740
you provided additional info you provide

512
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,630
the contextual information along with

513
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,760
the color to make sure that your user

514
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,800
understands what is happening what

515
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,960
they're doing what they need to do pair

516
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,390
the color with text or descriptive icons

517
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,490
that the user can easily understand and

518
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,250
use and ensure high contrast between

519
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,440
element background and foreground now

520
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,600
time for some opinion accessibility

521
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,490
benefits more people than you would

522
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,820
think when we talk about or when we

523
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,480
think about physical disability when we

524
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,220
talk about places being accessible when

525
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,900
we even think of the dips in the

526
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,600
sidewalk that you see are those being

527
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,180
used only by people who are physically

528
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,420
disabled who are on wheelchairs or are

529
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,310
they also being used by other people

530
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:27,470
parents with babies in strollers all the

531
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,830
people older people with low mobility

532
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,390
people like me who still likes to work

533
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,850
down that you know even though I can

534
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,330
step aside and you know the point is not

535
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,270
that the point is don't exclude anyone

536
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:47,810
if you can if if you start thinking of

537
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,630
accessibility like a feature

538
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,840
then you are by design excluding people

539
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,550
and that's harmful so when we talk about

540
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,790
web accessibility if our apps are

541
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,040
accessible that does not just mean that

542
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,590
people who are blind would be able to

543
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,930
use it but think of older people who

544
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,390
have a tough time trying to memorize the

545
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,100
newer interfaces that we come up with

546
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,690
every day they might be able to grasp it

547
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,910
better more easily if they are using the

548
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,130
accessibility options increasing the

549
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,620
font size they might have an easier time

550
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:29,020
with it so try to keep that in mind it

551
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,600
might seem like a lot of work at first

552
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,150
but somebody said to me that once you

553
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,100
get into the flow of it once you start

554
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,710
writing your code semantically it gets

555
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,110
very easy and you just start doing it

556
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,450
without thinking so that is something

557
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,390
that where we need to get at and for

558
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,490
that we have several accessibility tools

559
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,530
as well that will make our life easier

560
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,920
while we are trying to get there since I

561
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,450
don't have enough time I just want to

562
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,810
very briefly depend to unit testing what

563
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,250
are the kinds of things that we should

564
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,740
test when we are developing react apps

565
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,210
we should test whether our area

566
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,770
attribute values are being set correctly

567
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,320
whether our page title is being updated

568
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,320
correctly whether our elements are being

569
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,990
focused when and when they should where

570
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,740
whether our announcers are working fine

571
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,840
everything apart from this should be

572
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,200
caught in the lender here is a very

573
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,050
simple unit example here I have a react

574
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,020
component name button which has a label

575
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,870
called close he in this test I am

576
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,870
checking whether the underlying HTML

577
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,810
button has the Aria label property set

578
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,560
correctly or not

579
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,530
this will ensure that the screen reader

580
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,930
is able to read the value of this button

581
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,810
correctly so you can think of more tests

582
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:50,560
like this time for tools dev tools for

583
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,190
accessibility

584
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,140
we have several libraries take your pick

585
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,830
we have es lint plugin for accessibility

586
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,850
in JSX

587
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,250
it's a very cool useful lender that will

588
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,750
tell you where you are falling short

589
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,000
what you should do

590
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,740
and what what things you should correct

591
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,560
in your code we have react accessibility

592
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,630
analyser and react acts which throw

593
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,090
errors into your console so that you

594
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,800
know where things are going wrong in

595
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,620
terms of accessibility if you are a

596
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,190
beginner and you want to start into this

597
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,350
but are not sure where to begin the

598
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,680
create react app repo by Facebook is a

599
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,560
very good starter it also comes with

600
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,440
several accessibility options configured

601
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,650
so it would be a good place to start and

602
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,050
then there are several accessible

603
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,510
modules available at this link over here

604
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,910
react not rocks slash tag slash

605
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,690
accessible there are several other tools

606
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,090
that you might be able to use when

607
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,620
you're developing your app there's

608
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,610
Chrome extension called C this is a very

609
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,700
cool very useful one in which you are

610
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,770
able to see your app from the

611
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,110
perspective of a colorblind person you

612
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,810
are able to see it the way a colorblind

613
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,130
person would see it and it really at

614
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,170
first it can be really jarring but also

615
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:18,750
it should generate a lot of empathy and

616
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,310
then you'll be able to understand better

617
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,310
and try it better code design better

618
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,890
apps and make sure that whatever

619
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,750
shortcomings you have in your code right

620
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,940
now those are removed then there is

621
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,540
another tool called contrast checkol it

622
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,030
will help you decide whether help you

623
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,860
discover whether the contrast in your

624
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,150
app is fine or not

625
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,600
and finally the react Docs and

626
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,370
accessibility are very useful I have

627
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,710
that from them personally and I found

628
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,360
them a good good place to start with

629
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,670
alright so that was my talk thank you

630
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,540
