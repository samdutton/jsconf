6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,900
I couldn't be happier to be the first

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,460
speaker because it means I get this over

00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,920

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,920
it's their first time and I've been to a

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,720
lot of first time conferences and this

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,100
is one of the most well executed

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,590
conference of ever speaker selection is

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,870
great it's pretty good I can't wait for

18
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,640
next year I think about things that

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,170
we've been doing that's qualified how we

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,200
evolved our software over the years and

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,750
some lessons we learn about how to move

22
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,369
with big teams to work with big teams

23
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:08,470
integrate a lot of people together work

24
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,400
in the same codebase

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,860
and how our desktop application for

26
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,840
Spotify has evolved during the years

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
my name is flickering I work at quiz

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,850
shop and today I was talking about flow

29
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,470
it's a static type checker for

30
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,110
JavaScript developer Facebook and so far

31
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,759
this Congress has been amazing and the

32
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,250
local community really did a good job I

33
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,640
just talked about maze processing and

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,340
how you can use what's available in

35
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,540
browser already to do something that you

36
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,390
may think really complicated and you

37
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,310
have to use external library but it's

38
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,560
really once you understand a concept you

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:02:15,850
can all do it in browser

43
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,689
really excited about it but this is so

44
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,609
different than it's like another level

45
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:37,040
of different nature and beauty I'm

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,930
really excited about it and I'm really

47
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,040
