1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,139

this is one of my favorite subject of

2
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,019
all JavaScript is like as Guillermo say

3
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:17,300
before like JavaScript can be be on the

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,369
web you can do a lot of amazing things

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,169
with JavaScript not only on the website

6
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,509
but you can dollar theme especially on

7
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:25,849
the hardware side so I'm gonna to talk

8
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:28,880
today about the JavaScript oryx or so I

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,170
talked about note boats

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,370
Sanna chips we're talking about this

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,230
topic in her talk so I'm gonna like to

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,449
pass through some topics that are really

13
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:42,470
similar the the idea is like to show the

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,780
the stuff I bring here some of my

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,869
experiments or products that I've been

16
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:50,000
working on and I want to share it with

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,010
you so no boats basically is robotics

18
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,339
that are made accessible to JavaScript

19
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:03,129
developers this is possible right now

20
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,119
because of nodejs

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,570
but the main idea the main philosophy of

22
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,340
notebooks is that can be used with

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,560
different JavaScript platforms right now

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,950
the main platform is Bay news is no but

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,140
maybe in the future there would be other

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,969
JavaScript reforms that would be in able

27
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:23,030
to control hardware or electronics or

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,479
robot say using javascript so this is

29
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,079
torold by chris williams or buddha Tiki

30
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,299
God he is the main organizer of the J's

31
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,450
comp in United States and he wrote like

32
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,420
library called notes Edo port that will

33
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,130
enable you to control CEO the Harvard

34
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,499
devices used in JavaScript so this is

35
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:48,409
using like a native simples flows being

36
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,090
the in order to do the communication but

37
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,490
this will enable to you not only to

38
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,009
control like a development board like an

39
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,679
Arduino but some other different

40
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:01,219
hardware projects as you can see today

41
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:05,780
so basically this started using the

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,020
notes field port the module and the film

43
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,780
at a Fermata is a framework needs to be

44
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,060
a blow to they Arduino to the board and

45
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,360
this will enable like a serial API so

46
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,930
you will control the board you

47
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,879
like a serial API communication and you

48
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,299
can do like most of the things that an

49
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:26,519
Adreno or a board can do so initially

50
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,370
this these were like the start like

51
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,709
using a sweet important from our above

52
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:34,879
this has been a ball the ball being

53
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,549
really fast so let's introduce you to

54
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:42,150
Johnny 525 is a library created by Rick

55
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,030
Waldron Rick Warren is my really really

56
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,909
smart guy and I really admire him and if

57
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,189
I'll also be behind this is like you can

58
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:53,400
write hard work code as easy as you are

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,040
writing like web applications similar

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,989
like the philosophy to jQuery when you

61
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,329
are like years in evidence and you are

62
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,090
controlling the different Dom elements

63
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,269
but they've an idea that you can control

64
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,659
hardware devices using plain simple

65
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:15,239
JavaScript so an example here it's basic

66
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,849
code where you need to install from NPM

67
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,980
the journey 5 library it will fetch the

68
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,719
library and son it in your computer and

69
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,169
you are like only with a few lines of

70
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:28,650
code creating like abort

71
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,209
so you are controlling the board you are

72
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,359
you want to work with and when the board

73
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:36,000
is ready you are instantiating of

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,970
creating a new instance of the class let

75
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,689
and then you are executing methods on

76
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,090
that object so this is the basic code to

77
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,409
make a web blink so this with this basic

78
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,840
code you you are going to see like a LED

79
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,909
linking if you if you want to like to

80
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,790
write this same piece of code on Arduino

81
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,669
using the wiring or C++ you need like to

82
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,269
define to define delays on first turn on

83
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,259
the LED then turn off the LED and

84
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:10,620
control the timing using 25 is as easy

85
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,560
as as you can see on the on the screen

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,720
there are different abstractions on

87
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,870
journey 5 there is like a huge list of

88
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,970
abstraction taken from the universal

89
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,190
source code it is really really good

90
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,690
this structure if you want like to

91
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,180
contribute cool open source project dial

92
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,639
and by the

93
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,669
to contribute the 25 my first like

94
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:35,620
pooled request to open-source project

95
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,479
was with 25 I was a note note conf 2015

96
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,210
and I wanted to play with the PSO class

97
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,139
I say okay I can like make sound with a

98
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,889
little specific electronic circuit but

99
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,139
the class wasn't implemented at the time

100
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,340
so I asked free

101
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,590
oh-hoh kind of play with this PSO and he

102
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,710
said it's not implemented please do it

103
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,039
so I took that as a challenge it took me

104
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,800
like one year to to complete the pull

105
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,659
request but I created like the basic

106
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:09,819
implementation of the PS class and now

107
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:12,340
you can like play sounds using in

108
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,750
Journey five and demonstrate though

109
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,610
there are different other abstractions

110
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,129
for connecting sir ball sensors

111
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,339
radio infrared the electronic system so

112
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,330
they're pretty free very young there are

113
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,099
other other frameworks that will enable

114
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:28,870
you to control hardware and the result

115
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,509
are called silent ASAP is quite

116
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:33,370
different but it can support like a

117
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,560
different type of boards so this is a

118
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,110
right now initially we started like with

119
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,180
Arduino but right now the echo system of

120
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,039
boards off electronic boards has been

121
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,169
growing so we have now a dream of

122
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,349
Raspberry Pi BeagleBone black Pinocchio

123
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,189
spark

124
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,349
Galileo tehsil a lot of boards that can

125
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:55,629
be controlled using javascript there

126
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,419
even once one board that can be

127
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:00,339
controlled directly with JavaScript not

128
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,919
using like a serial connection as we are

129
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,229
doing with adreno but internally in the

130
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,699
microcontroller they are doing some

131
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,310
interesting stuff as tehsil there's a

132
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,960
loose a cool company that I was creating

133
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,539
a board that can be programmed directly

134
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,300
with JavaScript so javascript is taking

135
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,240
the hardware part but for me the more

136
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,639
important part of no BOTS is not like

137
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,110
the hardware or the things you can do

138
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,539
with it school you can do a lot of

139
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,879
interesting projects but for me the most

140
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:30,430
interesting part of no BOTS is the

141
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,409
community it's a really really big

142
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,789
community and really impressive

143
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:36,339
community and so welcoming I feel really

144
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:37,140
rebuilding

145
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,460
in this community in this note Kampf I

146
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,090
get my first Arduino kid as a gift from

147
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,640
Raquel Bayless rattle Bailey's he's one

148
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,250
of the robot-assisted are working on the

149
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,160
core project of no BOTS and she gave me

150
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,700
a kid and she said to me grab his kid

151
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,610
and teach the people in Colombia how to

152
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,460
use it and right now this was kind of

153
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,920
one year ago and right now we have like

154
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,380
a lot of kids that some people are

155
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,480
donating to the community I had the

156
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,680
opportunity to travel to other countries

157
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,500
and to start other communities there so

158
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,270
they held both community is really

159
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,970
powerful and empowering so there is the

160
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,920
International Notebook day it happens

161
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,710
once a year and community for from all

162
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,240
around the world gets together and play

163
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,440
with wave JavaScript and with no BOTS so

164
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,150
we are all around the world and we want

165
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,930
to see more dots or more communities in

166
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,670
Latin America because we want like to

167
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,770
spread the war and to have like a really

168
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,760
healthy community and there's no boats

169
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,590
también habla espanol although they also

170
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,840
speak Spanish there are really

171
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,970
interesting a community in Latin America

172
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,920
and we are starting with the ginger

173
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,850
years with about 100 people attended to

174
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,130
the first and no birthday we started

175
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,490
like basically learn learning how to

176
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,160
plug other chronic components to the

177
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,570
board and we right now we have like a

178
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,610
bigger community we were like giving

179
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,320
away hard work to other people in order

180
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,110
to pull them to keep working on hard war

181
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,410
and we have like from kids to six or

182
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,430
eight years old to the people well maybe

183
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,280
70 80 years so it's a really interesting

184
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,450
thing to to share with other people so I

185
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,680
had the opportunity to travel to

186
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,780
Guatemala to uh to give a workshop and a

187
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,760
talk about loud boats and in Guatemala

188
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,140
right now there are two no boats

189
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,030
community the main community it's on the

190
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,160
capital city and the other community is

191
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,010
really interesting it's located

192
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,240
really a small Mayan town that has a

193
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,580
really small population and people from

194
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,430
from this town travel to Guatemala City

195
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,780
like nine hours by using the boss and

196
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,240
and we give them a lot of hardware and

197
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,400
they are right now

198
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,020
managing that community there auntie Xin

199
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,610
electronics to other people so this is

200
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,500
important and poor you know there are

201
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,380
other communities you can see there we

202
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,910
have so much fun in Guatemala we have

203
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,520
like a soccer tournament with two robots

204
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,790
where we're playing football on the the

205
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,070
people we gave like the free hardware

206
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,710
they are like teaching to other people

207
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,900
how to how to build this stuff and also

208
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,870
we have this I wrote note rockets even

209
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,020
though it's really awesome so bringing

210
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,470
more people into tech to through the

211
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,300
power of the community that is main idea

212
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,070
we want to we want to bring more people

213
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,340
into tag into software development

214
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,390
through the power of the community the

215
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,920
community is really powerful if you are

216
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,140
here is because you are interested in

217
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,850
something and get together with other

218
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,800
people hack together their or their

219
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,750
community's human societies or in the

220
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,360
city you are living in places this is

221
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,150
really interesting we we have the

222
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,750
opportunity to travel to to a town in in

223
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,400
Colombia it's an afro-colombian town

224
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,650
really poor or forgetting by the by the

225
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,690
government but they are like really

226
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,180
empowered because they they are using

227
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,980
technology to teach others and they are

228
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,270
changing the whole mindset so this is

229
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,070
for me really really really nice to be

230
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,940
part of this so this is the basic

231
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,700
introduction let's do some some demos

232
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,130
and see if this is working its fingers

233
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,710
this is hard this is the first one this

234
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,770
is a assumable this is all the whole

235
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,960
project is open source so you can

236
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,650
download the CAD files and am praying

237
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,180
the the parts using a 3d printer or

238
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,880
Lassard Carter and we I'm using in this

239
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,850
project the SPARC microcontroller so the

240
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,790
spark is connected to Wi-Fi I'm going to

241
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,950
check if everything is working right now

242
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,770
so I'm going to plug it these will

243
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,470
connect to the SPARC cloud there is a

244
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,910
cloud the wheelers have this robot the

245
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,890
internet let's see is trying to connect

246
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,730
to the network okay it's connected and

247
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:21,970
I'm going to run the application

248
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:31,570
don't let me execute this

249
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,040
so my computer right now will add as a

250
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,400
web server so what we want is like to

251
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,950
control the the bot using the cell phone

252
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,950
or using a wearable let me check if the

253
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,230
application is working good I'm going

254
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:58,950
executed from here that's from the cell

255
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:06,620
phone if it's working and no nice

256
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,790
advanced

257
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,950
okay then they show really quick I

258
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,930
wanted like to execute it from the cell

259
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,550
phone but the connection is not working

260
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,220
right now but I can send comments to the

261
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,990
to the world I'm using the manual

262
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,360
version because I can oh thanks

263
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:33,300
nice catch

264
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,680
yeah well hey I wanted to control the

265
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,540
body isn't there the SmartWatch maybe

266
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,430
later the internet is not working right

267
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,329
now but well no problem this is the the

268
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:48,370
other project it's called a note copter

269
00:12:48,370 --> 00:13:09,430
it's an AR Drone see if it's a novel

270
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,309
told a will told you this afternoon this

271
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,399
is like running our web server so I can

272
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,259
control this from a web application

273
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:21,579
grown in Express and socket IO now let

274
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:32,079
me see if I can control it so this has

275
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,149
like a Wi-Fi hotspot so I need to

276
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:37,209
connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot and do the

277
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:41,040
magic but it's not working

278
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:54,949
nice okay

279
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,230
ATM is working

280
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,880
meanwhile this is connected I can show

281
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,240
you other other projects this one eats

282
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,880
and gaita or queasy is like Colombian

283
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,970
fall instrument mainly used to play the

284
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,880
guy Tom yet to play cumbia anyone heard

285
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,980
cumbia anyone like cumbia cumbia Jetta

286
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,000
or gray that's good

287
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,600
so this is the this is like Ronnie now

288
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,130
webserver I'm using the bigger bone

289
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:34,250
black this has like a mic so each time I

290
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,640
told her the sensor noise he he will

291
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,840
like change the the color pouring but

292
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,490
they did like you can have your own

293
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,680
musical instrument and create a really

294
00:14:45,680 --> 00:15:30,040
fun stuff so let me see if I can play it

295
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:38,309
okay

296
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:44,480
oops let's see if the other are working

297
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,240
in meanwhile Oh perfect

298
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,139
I think we are we aren't I'm so I'm not

299
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:53,179
a musician but I like some music

300
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:55,279
projects this is one I basic I've been

301
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,259
working on this is a drum kit so I'm

302
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:00,290
using like a pad like you can play some

303
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:00,769
sound

304
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:04,999
can I have audio I have a real great

305
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:11,449
thanks perfect thank you so we're doing

306
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:13,730
with these project is mapping the kids

307
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,439
their keys with with some samples from a

308
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:21,529
row on a real drum kit so you can build

309
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:28,710
your own instrument so let me play it

310
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:47,899
you're gonna execute it okay so you can

311
00:16:47,899 --> 00:17:02,939
create me as he gave in with electronics

312
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:10,400
so now they're in the different oh okay

313
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,699
this this project this is connected

314
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,220
right now this is so unstable right now

315
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,049
because I crash it like up multiple

316
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,100
times

317
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:24,280
I'm not a good toilet but there can I

318
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:30,230
see the stream please can you focus the

319
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:36,410
screen or the video I need I want to

320
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:46,940
show okay so yeah let me check its first

321
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,419
application okay so I'm going to execute

322
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,850
the it's an application called the web

323
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:59,270
flight so you can control you can run

324
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,100
like an Express server and using Sicario

325
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,770
you will be able like to control an old

326
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,870
boat from your web browser so I'm going

327
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:16,580
to enter to express application okay

328
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,200
this is the camera of the drawing right

329
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,860
now this is the thing maybe it will

330
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,520
crash but I'm going to try to fly it so

331
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:34,340
say away whoa no no not the we know do

332
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,830
me no to me you know the way okay

333
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,379
whoa Lord and he doesn't like web

334
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:42,820
application just to know that it's

335
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:49,420
flying as you can see real time

336
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,290
really quickly we're gonna ask what it

337
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,260
is this is now that r2d2 hell and I

338
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,900
don't kill utterly do its have you heard

339
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,410
about an instrument called the Thurman

340
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,810
it's kind of a specie of termine let me

341
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,310
see it is working so why don't they need

342
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:14,570
this project is I'm going to run in the

343
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:20,850
studio I'm using like the right sensor

344
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,590
to control like the notes like the

345
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,130
frequency and the left sensor in there

346
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,720
are all transonic sensor so it measures

347
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,250
distance so I'm usually like to do to

348
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,810
control sound so can I see there okay

349
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:50,820
thank you let me mutant like a wood

350
00:19:50,820 --> 00:20:02,789
application written by sub stuck

351
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,169
so I'm changing the frequency only using

352
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:07,400
the license

353
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,309
psycho plays on kind of music and then I

354
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:23,900
can add some really nice Distortion

355
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,860
so you can play with three different

356
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,780
experiences they'd be in a party or

357
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,670
something when you can use sensors and

358
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,890
culture the likes and as you can see the

359
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,710
the frequency of the sound is changing

360
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,900
this is all written in JavaScript so you

361
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,590
can create you

362
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,940
you're like music look like your music

363
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,650
function so it doesn't work

364
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,110
very good and the last one was the

365
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,350
clumsy pipette this one I have time to

366
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,670
play those we're done done okay so this

367
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,059
is a pipette did you use in aid servers

368
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:05,610
it seems that it would walk time times

369
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:11,780
over right okay it's sad okay okay

370
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,630
let's see I'm trying to teach him like

371
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,640
to walk but is not a really good Walker

372
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,440
so what I call it they like the clone

373
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,980
see the clown's here my pet so it has

374
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:32,940
like some problem walking but then I can

375
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:47,940
run really quickly here okay this is not

376
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,540
like he is trying to walk but there's

377
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,970
not a really good Walker so units teach

378
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,690
him oh it's residence so it's really

379
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,920
difficult to control like the age

380
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,910
servers at the same time the I'm using

381
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,710
like johnny-five in all of the

382
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,710
experiments it's a really powerful like

383
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,040
like library the someone won't want to

384
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,500
play with either later we are going to

385
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,780
stay here until December 10 and the main

386
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,540
idea is like to help with the local

387
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,070
community and to have some no box

388
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,809
experience here so we brought some

389
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,880
Arduino kit so the idea is like the next

390
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,090
week maybe we are going to to give up

391
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,510
workshop here and scenes

392
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,560
I received my first kid as a gift in an

393
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,960
event I want to give this like as a gift

394
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,120
for the community too so if you want to

395
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,470
keep this this robot in Argentina and

396
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,470
keep playing with it so I've been in

397
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,320
