00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,099

good afternoon everyone looks like this

2
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,930
is the right size so that I don't get to

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,130
do the cool god mode thing I thanks for

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,650
having me I'm here to talk about editing

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,650
content on the web and tool that I built

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,189
to help do that call quill so first a

7
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:29,619
little bit of background it kind of

8
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,330
started three years ago when I started a

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,820
company we were trying to build a

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,269
collaborative a collaborative editor a

11
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:39,879
lot like Google Docs and so people can

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,640
text type simultaneously you can work

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,710
together simultaneously on the same

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,770
document so the main a big part of that

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,680
of course is the editor and so when we

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,989
started you know we had seen other

17
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,059
editors on the web we had used the web

18
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,039
for a long time and so we figured we

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,860
could just reuse one of those possibly

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,079
an open source one and just add

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,619
collaboration on top of it but so we

22
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:08,229
didn't we didn't expect anything to find

23
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,119
anything out of the box that would just

24
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:12,070
work but we had hoped that we could be

25
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,399
able to extend it to so that we didn't

26
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:17,130
have to write everything from scratch

27
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,899
the big problem was that we encountered

28
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:21,910
that these editors didn't didn't have

29
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,030
anything that resembled an API when it

30
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,450
did have kind of a page an API page in

31
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,009
their documentation when you look at

32
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,630
kind of the methods and what they

33
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,770
offered it basically was the Dom was the

34
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,679
Dom API so for example if you wanted to

35
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:41,140
get content from these editors they give

36
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,030
you the content in the form of HTML

37
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,520
which you could already do with inner

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,179
HTML and if you wanted to set kind of

39
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:51,220
change any part of the document you

40
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,360
either have to parse and figure out

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,069
which part of that you wanted to change

42
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:56,200
or the methods that they gave you just

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,130
set the entire document so for at least

44
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,630
for our purposes you couldn't just if

45
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,099
you're typing along and other people are

46
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,899
typing along and your resetting the

47
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,179
document on every keystroke that just

48
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,120
wasn't really going to work out for us

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,920
and this kind of is a bigger problem

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,530
that the fact that it didn't have an API

51
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,470
means that kind of the the offerings out

52
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,580
there words

53
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,170
the offerings out there was what you got

54
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,599
if you couldn't extend on those

55
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,819
offerings and you couldn't really

56
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:31,470
improve upon the editing experience and

57
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,720
you couldn't and you're limited to

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,000
basically the imaginations of the people

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,970
that built those products so I we

60
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,280
started working on quill to solve that

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,880
problem and a key thing was that we

62
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,410
wanted a design quill so it could be a

63
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,630
drop-in replacement as a rich text

64
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,590
editor but it also needed feature needed

65
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,840
to feature an API that allowed you to

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,750
customize its behavior and allow you to

67
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,700
extend upon it so you could build

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,989
something that we didn't really think

69
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,900
about and so so that's what I'll talk

70
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,400
mostly about today so before I get

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,459
started and do demonstrations of the API

72
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,890
just the things that we want to keep in

73
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,079
mind when we were building it where we

74
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,660
wanted to be very simple that's

75
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,549
something of course desirable in any API

76
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:26,180
for a quill specifically it meant that

77
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,400
the content that you got the kind of the

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,470
data that you were working with was much

79
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,329
simpler than HTML if you had to start

80
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,819
parsing kind of start parsing the

81
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,530
content yourself then that's a

82
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,900
non-starter we wanted to be very

83
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,630
powerful which helps with the simplicity

84
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,400
because if you just do whatever you want

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,480
and then that's a very simple interface

86
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,220
but also for quote specifically that

87
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,049
means you should be able to change the

88
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,000
content whenever you want wherever you

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,040
want you could change a subset of the

90
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,170
document you could change any part of it

91
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,970
not just where the cursor is not just

92
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,060
the entire document and of course wanted

93
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,540
to be invented you vented because any

94
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,470
good API has events so I'm going to

95
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:17,099
switch to to quill to show you okay okay

96
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:23,039
that is ah crap okay see I kind of had a

97
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,300
feeling that where's my mom okay okay

98
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,099
had a feeling that would happen so I

99
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:38,930
have a backup okay

100
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,300
okay so basically it looks like a rich

101
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,510
text editor that you can type into it

102
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,450
you can apply formatting so it kind of

103
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,890
it does all the things that you want

104
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,500
from an editor but what we want to focus

105
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,850
more on is the API and basically I've

106
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,950
this is the documentation page for quill

107
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,660
quill jfcom and we've exposed a global

108
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,320
variable that you'd you can basically

109
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,330
try out any of these methods on the on

110
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,690
the main editor so before I do that I'll

111
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,600
just go over some of those some of those

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,400
methods okay and we're back to this okay

113
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,250
so first part retrieving the content so

114
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,810
like I said we don't want you to have to

115
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,350
deal with HTML so there's a few ways you

116
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,950
can get content there's get texts which

117
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,520
is just plain text via content which is

118
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,840
basically an array of the content that

119
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,690
i'll just show more in the demonstration

120
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,210
and then get selection where you can

121
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,240
basically this will return an index a

122
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,120
range that is an index into the editor

123
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,520
not if you're familiar with the Dom API

124
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,250
it would it would have given you an HTML

125
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,800
Emlyn with with an offset from that so

126
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,720
this kind of frees you from having to

127
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,030
parse I yourself and figure out where in

128
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,790
the place of the document that is ok so

129
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,600
let's kill that the ok all right we are

130
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:24,360
back ok so to start off with get text

131
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,070
and

132
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,950
okay okay so you can see this is

133
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,790
basically just the the plain text output

134
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,350
of quill um oh man I should have done

135
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,090
that god mode thing because it looks

136
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,490
like the bottom okay I do have to do the

137
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:53,560
sign okay awesome think it's not my

138
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:05,860
doing it wrong I mean that looks good

139
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,170
enough okay okay we'll go with that okay

140
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,270
okay all right so the more interesting

141
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,860
one is probably get contents and

142
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,930
actually I'll just you can set in index

143
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,660
if you want this is overloaded so so

144
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,390
this is the first 60 characters I would

145
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,130
have we would have designed to return

146
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,740
just an array but over we want to add

147
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,240
functionality to this object so it's KY

148
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,550
we didn't think inheriting from array

149
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,070
has its own issues so basically there's

150
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,230
one object that is an array and so you

151
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,240
can see the way the text is just quill

152
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,130
rich text editor and then there's an

153
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,350
attributes object that says it's 18

154
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:55,390
point font the next object is the text

155
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,270
that i typed with the with plain text

156
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,460
and open source which has this attribute

157
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,440
link so okay so let's take a look at I'd

158
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,170
so let's take a look at a demonstration

159
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,740
of this so here okay I won't push

160
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,630
refresh because I might screw things up

161
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,360
okay so this is basically let's let's

162
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,720
assume we're this will be demonstrating

163
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,480
get content and basically I'm going to

164
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:39,020
be able to type into this ah five and

165
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,980
okay and so you can see it actually

166
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,970
generates marked down so if I were

167
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,950
writing Lord of the Rings i would say

168
00:08:46,950 --> 00:09:04,809
okay and was do you

169
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,999
okay so that's how I would have wrote

170
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:09,949
would have wrote Lord of the Rings and

171
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,949
save a lot of trouble for everyone on so

172
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:15,829
if you bold if you apply formatting it

173
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:19,759
does it produces right markup and since

174
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,329
I'm such a nice person I might even add

175
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,729
a link for for if you didn't know who

176
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:28,970
the Eagles were of a well this is the

177
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,519
wrong link but just for just to

178
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,809
demonstrate that you know it does

179
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:36,769
generate the right syntax so this is

180
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:41,479
this is basically using a the quail get

181
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:45,289
content API call it's incredibly simple

182
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:49,189
whoops okay did the demo already this is

183
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,970
basically the meat of the demo and all

184
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,399
it does is you get the contents you loop

185
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,049
through it and when you encounter an

186
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:59,389
interesting or an attribute then you

187
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:03,139
just applied the you change the you

188
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,569
apply the kind of the markup to to

189
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:08,629
produce markdown and so this is maybe I

190
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:11,809
only there there only two here but you

191
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:15,199
can kind of add the other the other

192
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,720
features that markup markdown supports

193
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,149
and this is an incredibly simple

194
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:21,949
function because you didn't have to you

195
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:25,339
didn't have to all of the interpreting

196
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:26,959
what the contents of the editor was

197
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,759
already done for you so once that is

198
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,439
done you can take it and do whatever you

199
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:32,389
want with it so that's just one example

200
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:37,519
with doing that with mark down okay so

201
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,329
next I'll talk about modifying content

202
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,850
so there's three main functions for that

203
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,129
you can insert text delete text and

204
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,799
format text and all three of these I

205
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,399
think the the API is pretty intuitive

206
00:10:52,399 --> 00:11:00,540
and I'll just demonstrate them in this

207
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,010
all right now go with a different one

208
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:11,530
here

209
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,570
ok so for example if I want to do quill

210
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:21,120
dot insert text on the 6-position

211
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,720
JavaScript so this inserts a text and

212
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,670
since I didn't say that it was formatted

213
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,389
I inserts plain text so i can go ahead

214
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:59,710
and format that

215
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,569
ok so if formats that and then I can

216
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:18,540
also delete it

217
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,190
and if I were to have done the insertion

218
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,899
correctly the first time this would be

219
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,880
what it does okay so pretty pretty

220
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,209
simple API um I'll just go into another

221
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:41,769
example of what you can do so let a lot

222
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,600
of people use quill as kind of adding

223
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,820
messaging to their app and messaging or

224
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,410
email they want to add email

225
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,120
functionality and it's not the quickl

226
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,310
core part of their app but it's

227
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,600
something that they want to add and not

228
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:03,010
necessarily have to focus on on so okay

229
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,040
so I guess well the part that I want to

230
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,260
focus on is you're probably all seen it

231
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,390
pretty much every editor has the same

232
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,730
link tool tip that allows you to edit

233
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,430
the link but here because you can

234
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,740
because you're the one that gets through

235
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,170
format the text and you don't have to

236
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,690
that means you can basically you're the

237
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,790
one that gets a set set it at the end

238
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,380
you don't have to use somebody else's

239
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,200
you can switch out the link tool tip and

240
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,910
use your own interface so for example

241
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,820
here maybe most of the time when you

242
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,470
when you're high when you're trying to

243
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,209
link something maybe you just want a

244
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,430
google search and a lot of times that's

245
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,649
what the link that you want or that's

246
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:47,440
the URL that you want so here this this

247
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,329
is kind of example of how you can modify

248
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,310
the behavior and modify the editing

249
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,320
experience that isn't necessarily bound

250
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,410
to what somebody else had decided was

251
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,930
the best wing tool tip and this may not

252
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,779
the i guess the point here isn't that

253
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,850
this is a better interface but the fact

254
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,279
is that you can because cool has an API

255
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,130
you can you can you can invent new

256
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,529
interfaces try those and if they may be

257
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:13,240
better than the ones that are already

258
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,490
provided so the point is that you can

259
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,019
extend this and you can change the

260
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:19,120
editing experience and you can push the

261
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,160
boundaries make better editing products

262
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:32,790
oh yeah I think okay so

263
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,480
okay so last thing I'll cover is events

264
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,700
basically there are two events you can

265
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,040
figure out when the selection change

266
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,820
happens or text change happens and I

267
00:14:45,820 --> 00:15:05,980
will go back to Ashley okay

268
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,689
action

269
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:14,230
okay so this just registers a a handler

270
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,410
and now if I change the selection at all

271
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,850
it'll basically tell you that it's

272
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,829
changed when it's a cursor it's same

273
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:23,589
number and when it's different it gets

274
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,799
the whole gets the whole range and when

275
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,059
you lose focus it's no so so that

276
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:32,679
selection change text change is very

277
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,790
similar now I'll just go to the the last

278
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,600
demo which is which is actually one of

279
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,189
the my favorite use cases of quill

280
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:44,079
because it's kind of a use case that

281
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,540
which getting back to the reason why we

282
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,970
built it was it gets to something that

283
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,399
we didn't really think about when it

284
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,660
gets to an interface that we didn't

285
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,699
really think about when we were building

286
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,290
the editor at but because we made

287
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,419
extensible it's something that it was

288
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,819
able to be molded into that so there's

289
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:02,559
this interesting group at Stanford

290
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,819
that's doing doing some work on

291
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:08,069
translations it's kind of in the

292
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:10,779
interdisciplinary between the hard

293
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,919
science of translations but then also

294
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,309
user interfaces the kind of if you've

295
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,649
used translation services you know that

296
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,439
machines aren't perfect at it so you

297
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,239
kind of still you still need a human

298
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,549
involved so they're doing work to bridge

299
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:30,149
the gap between the two with from user

300
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,489
usability perspective so this is a demo

301
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:38,169
of what functionality that they built so

302
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:40,539
immediately what it does is it's

303
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,799
essentially autocomplete for

304
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:45,369
translations so this is the text that a

305
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:46,839
translator would potentially have to

306
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,869
translate and here is the machines best

307
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:53,859
guess and so it's relatively good the

308
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:56,529
guesses are relatively good and but

309
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,149
sometimes when it's a little less sure

310
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,579
it'll present a few options and in this

311
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:02,980
case is not actually correct or this is

312
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,409
perhaps a better translation and then

313
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:10,149
you can kind of accept the rest so so

314
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:11,409
again that was something that we didn't

315
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,179
design for when we built quill we didn't

316
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,850
think about ways to improve the

317
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,529
experience for a translator but this

318
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:19,510
something that you could build and I

319
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,269
guess the point the main point of of

320
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:23,809
quill

321
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,209
is that is its API and it's able to do

322
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,210
this because it has one and so to

323
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,580
conclude I kind of want to step back

324
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,600
from quill specifically and talk about

325
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,330
API is in general if you think about

326
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,759
products in everything as a graph then

327
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,799
if you just offer something without an

328
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,570
API it's essentially a terminal node

329
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,730
that's all you're going to get but if

330
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,220
you offer an API then it could be part

331
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,559
of a larger offering and it could spawn

332
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,210
many more products and many more ideas

333
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,119
so when you are building kind of those

334
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,460
products and services I encourage you to

335
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,559
think about that if you want if you want

336
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,649
your offering to be kind of that's all

337
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,200
the offering is or if you want to kind

338
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,029
of open the doors for something else

339
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:11,059
that you didn't think about so that's
