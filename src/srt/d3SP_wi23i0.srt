00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830

Hey okay so I want to start by telling

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,639
you a story about three and a half years

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,340
ago me and my wife decided to adopt a

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,929
puppy

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,170
this is Blizzard and you know as time

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,080
went by lizard grew larger fluffier

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,369
larger still even larger and then winter

8
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,550
came became horrible that roof and I'm

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,480
going to show you a video of blizzard

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,059
this is a very active and fun dog he

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,090
like runs around like a devil jumping on

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,290
stuff going here going there and in this

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,930
video I'm going to show you I want you

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,050
to look at his ears as he's jumping and

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,350
if you can kind of figure out what goes

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,440
on with his ears then you understand

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,960
everything that I have to tell you about

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,800
today so uh you guys ready you don't

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,809
know you maybe you haven't had your

20
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,030
coffee but like need you to be with me

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,420
you guys ready okay we'll work on that

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:20,230
okay

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,680
awesome so thank you very much it's fine

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,930
my name is offer I'm creative developer

25
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,300
of the company called echo where I work

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,560
on interactive videos

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,960
what are interactive videos so remember

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,300
as kids you had books where you'd really

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,280
need to say if you want to save the

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,070
princess go to page 91 and if you want

31
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,810
to chill out and have some beer go to

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,030
page 80 so that's the exact same thing

33
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,900
only on the web with video and an

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,990
interesting tidbit is that my name is in

35
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,840
Hebrew in Hebrew most names have an

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,780
actual meaning to them so offer is a

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,979
young deer or a fawn or Bambi if you

38
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,830
will and I'm not here to talk about

39
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,380
Bambi but I do want to talk about a

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,920
different Disney movie one that came out

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,970
in 1994 do you know which one that is

42
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,450
and he guessed right so that's true

43
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,660
that's the Lion King and the ranking is

44
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,420
a very special movie for me because it

45
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,700
was the first time I looked at one of

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,500
these amazing amazing animation movies

47
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,170
and realized that there's something more

48
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,630
going on here I mean there's so much

49
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,140
more than the story there is some magic

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,060
in this in this movie The Lion King

51
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,030
tells a story of a young lion Simba who

52
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,489
gets this in French right for from his

53
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,220
pride and by his evil uncle Jafar or

54
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,470
something and then comes back to take

55
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,330
his place that doesn't matter

56
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,310
The Lion King was a really good movie

57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,769
but it wasn't perfect and it wasn't this

58
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,549
mean his most original movie either but

59
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:07,590
there was just something so special

60
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,860
about this movie at least for me because

61
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,590
this was the first time I saw I saw

62
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,720
scenes like this and I thought well

63
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,120
these are in fact just moving pictures

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,220
these are drawings people made and it

65
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,450
they convey so much emotion and I wanted

66
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,310
to realize I wanted to understand how

67
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,040
come we're looking at this and we have

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,940
so much feels in us

69
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,070
so you know I grew up I read about it

70
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,400
and I came across this book the illusion

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,340
of life by Frank Thomas and Ollie

72
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,500
Johnston we came which came out in 1981

73
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,100
these guys are two of Disney's master

74
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,430
animators from the Golden Age and in

75
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,130
this book they lay out 12 principles of

76
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,910
classical animations these principles

77
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,980
include squash and stretch and

78
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,370
dissipations

79
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,670
arcs actions timings exaggerations we're

80
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,140
not going to go through all of them

81
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,580
because that would take like an entire

82
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,230
curriculum of classical animation

83
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,840
studies but I want to focus on one in

84
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,210
particular and that is follow through

85
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,940
and overlapping action so what exactly

86
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,650
is follow through and overlapping action

87
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,010
so take a look at this character for

88
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,380
example and it's Cape and seeing how the

89
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,170
character and the Kate interact let's

90
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,480
zoom in a bit further have a look at

91
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,090
this carrot you see how there's the

92
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,760
carrot body and there is the leaf an

93
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,770
extension of the body and the leaf

94
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,470
starts moving before the carrot and ends

95
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,810
moving after the carrot it's like a

96
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,700
really simple thing with a very powerful

97
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,510
thing let's break it apart even further

98
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:52,560
fall through as the act of the leaf

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,800
starting before and ending after the

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,460
moving of the main body of the carrot

101
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,669
overlying overlapping action is a offset

102
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,430
between the direction of the leaf and

103
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,919
the direction of the carrot body and the

104
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,040
two of these actually define different

105
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,390
aspect of the same thing so this also

106
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,330
gives a lot of life to an animation so

107
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,100
you can take a look at this animation

108
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,830
it's really nice but it kind of feels

109
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,790
weird in robotic and if you add

110
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,160
overlapping action suddenly this thing

111
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,990
feels much more alive

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,210
it also allows you to define the type of

113
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,000
material or or different feel something

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,640
has and this is see the same same exact

115
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,860
drawing with the same

116
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,379
timing but only this overlapping action

117
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:50,840
then fall through makes it makes the

118
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,599
material appear different so let me show

119
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,419
you some more examples from a show I'm

120
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:59,990
not going to name this is an Israeli

121
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,939
animator by name's Aaron Mendel who does

122
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,460
did these for each and every episodes

123
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,449
like little tidbits really cool stuff

124
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:10,849
this one is super cool I like take a

125
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:12,949
look at the little strand of hair as the

126
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,009
Hound chops off heads and the log is how

127
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,689
it just continues moving past be

128
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:21,409
animation or this one because it has a

129
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:27,229
dog and who can forget the season finale

130
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,590
and I'm sorry if I'm spoiling anyone but

131
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,229
like the date has been due so the

132
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:35,090
amazing season feel and finality that we

133
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:42,669
just had a couple of months ago okay so

134
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,560
you might ask okay this is super cool

135
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,379
but like where the J's conf and what why

136
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,000
am I talking about

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,629
these sorts of things so this is very

138
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,819
applicable to what we do as developers

139
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,580
as web developers take a look at this

140
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,830
example from code drops I'm going to

141
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,629
open up this dialog and see how it

142
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:06,830
whizzes past as it flies in and flies

143
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,830
out from the from the screen just by

144
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,430
animating the borders of this of this

145
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,810
window or this example where you have

146
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,680
modal and if you drag and stop dragging

147
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,460
then you have this really nice staggered

148
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,289
motion which you know gives a lot of

149
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:30,259
character to simple really simple things

150
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:32,719
but more like a modal it conveys a

151
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,089
motion and give some levity to the whole

152
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:41,629
thing okay so you can trust me but you

153
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,430
know Google says the same thing this is

154
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,009
from Google's material design page and

155
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,180
they say okay if you have an app then

156
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,699
you need to show some elements at the

157
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,399
same time for 2d users don't have them

158
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,919
all appear exactly at the same time

159
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,630
because that's really this

160
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,240
anything for the user instead have them

161
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,790
peer one after the other in a staggered

162
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,280
map instead staggered matter again

163
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,030
overlapping overlapping each other and

164
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,240
staggering okay this is another example

165
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,560
where they show you how to have elements

166
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,830
view one after the other or how about

167
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,620
this one where they animate a card by

168
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,270
showing first the image moving and then

169
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,610
the tenènte icon and then the text this

170
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,020
is something I made at work

171
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,630
it's a little spinner thing that user

172
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,940
sees before the video actual actually

173
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,550
loads which uses the same principle it's

174
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,080
a simple animation it's just like three

175
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,060
circles moving sounds like not a big

176
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,660
deal right

177
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,090
and in a sense it isn't but there is

178
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,250
some trick to the implementation it's

179
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,320
not as straightforward as you might

180
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,210
think and I'll show you how to implement

181
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,270
this in various in a bit in a few

182
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,720
different ways but first like let's take

183
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,940
inventory of what are you going to do so

184
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,400
we have four circles y 4 and not 3

185
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,430
because one always exit stage right and

186
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,610
one enters stage left and there's a

187
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,410
total iteration time which is how much

188
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,960
time the entire looping animation takes

189
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,300
that's one second there is a circle

190
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,130
movement time how much time does each

191
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,400
circle take to move that's 0.5 seconds

192
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,380
and there is the stagger time which is

193
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,600
how much time does each circle wait

194
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,180
before the last circle move that's point

195
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,420
15 seconds okay these are the specs for

196
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,080
our animation and I'm going to show

197
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,730
three different options on how to

198
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,190
implement them these are not the only

199
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,410
options but these are the options that I

200
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,920
oftentimes use the first one is

201
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,680
classical CSS you just do the CSS the

202
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,210
second one is with a green sock or G SAP

203
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,120
JavaScript animation library and the

204
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,610
third one it's kinda a new contender to

205
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,210
the game it's the web animation API or

206
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,700
wrappi which is a new API currently

207
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,060
being implemented in modern browsers

208
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,370
wacky doesn't really have a cool logo at

209
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,800
least not that I found but to me it kind

210
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,040
of

211
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,660
sounds like the sound this meme would

212
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,660
make so uh there I made a logo cool so

213
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,820
let's start with CSS and just to start

214
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,709
off let's talk about a little bit of the

215
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,550
pros is that CSS has good animation good

216
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,380
performance for the animation if you're

217
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:39,250
using the proper performance properties

218
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,540
and anna is going to be hopefully

219
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,279
talking about that later so do check out

220
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,300
her talk and also it is fine using only

221
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,970
CSS so you can kind of separate your

222
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,690
logic from your animation if you will

223
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,029
but it isn't perfect because nothing is

224
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,350
so CSS is kind of a has a limited

225
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,149
feature set in what you can achieve with

226
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:05,180
it and if you have to make complex

227
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,829
animations ones that we lie on each

228
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:09,110
other and synchronize and all sorts of

229
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,959
things it gets really difficult and you

230
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,639
can't do the dynamic animations so

231
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,220
dynamic animations are ones where you

232
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,839
want to do physics for example where a

233
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,870
ball jumps differently depending on how

234
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,430
you move the mouse or something like

235
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,860
that so that will be much harder to

236
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,540
achieve with CSS it's really hard to

237
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,600
debug the tools are getting better but

238
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,000
you can't kind of like scrub the time

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,279
like you would in the back of the good

240
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,350
old flash days cool so just a really

241
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,589
quick short recap on CSS animations so

242
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:48,319
essentially you have a keyframe which is

243
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,600
this thing here which defines several

244
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,430
frames and their percentage so it's 0%

245
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,829
we move by nothing at 25% we move by 100

246
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:04,959
pixels and at 100% we move by 400 pixels

247
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,880
then we apply it to the span which is

248
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,620
just like the only thing that we have

249
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,880
here with the animation property give it

250
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,660
the name move then number of seconds the

251
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,040
amount of time that the innovation is

252
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,899
going to take and whether it's going to

253
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,480
repeat how many times or infinitely in

254
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,680
this case and so you see this

255
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,160
little circle moving cool so let's

256
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,680
implement our circles let's first do it

257
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,869
without any staggering motion so I'm not

258
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:41,249
going to go through this just to show

259
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:43,800
you there's a keyframe here and you

260
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,459
translate it from zero to sixty pixels

261
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:51,179
that's it okay so let's make the

262
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:54,389
staggering effect add animation delay a

263
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:56,999
CSS property which delays the animation

264
00:12:56,999 --> 00:13:02,279
and as you'd expect cool so kind of same

265
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,970
thing only this time for the first

266
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,249
circle I give it the animation until I

267
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:10,019
have zero the second line this point 15

268
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,999
the third one is point six five so on so

269
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:18,410
forth let's see how that works and yeah

270
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:23,249
that's not what we wanted so what just

271
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:26,369
happened essentially a mission delay

272
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:29,540
only delays the first run iteration of

273
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,240
every animation it doesn't delay every

274
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,819
time the animation repeats which is kind

275
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:39,120
of annoying and leads to this thing

276
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,899
where if you take a look at the at how

277
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,149
the animation flows the first circle

278
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:48,420
started then the third but before the

279
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,339
second finished the fourth started as

280
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,470
well and that's like not what we wanted

281
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,179
at all so this is what we want we want

282
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,339
the fourth one to start then the third

283
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,620
then second then the first and then the

284
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,959
whole thing repeats after one second so

285
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,610
let's take a look at how this animation

286
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,160
would look like what are the key frames

287
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,559
that we know about so two of them will

288
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,259
really simple at 0% which is here you

289
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:18,449
don't move the thing so you don't move

290
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:22,529
it and at 100% you want it to be at the

291
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,309
end of the animation

292
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:25,949
so that's 60 pixels that's this one here

293
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,079
what about these two the one here and

294
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,990
the one here so we don't know the the

295
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,509
percent is yet once we know that this is

296
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,519
the actual animation so it moves from 0

297
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,420
to 60

298
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,780
so let's hopefully

299
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,000
now whether we're much more awake we can

300
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,950
do some math it's not a lot of math I

301
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,120
promise

302
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,900
but let's use math to figure out the

303
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,980
transition so zero percent is zero

304
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,830
second we know that 100% is in one

305
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,340
second

306
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,420
we know that this one letter here means

307
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,120
that we want to start at a delay what is

308
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,340
the delay twice because there were two

309
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,100
circles before so that's point 15 5

310
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,610
point 3 divided by 1 times 100 you get

311
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,640
30% this one is the exact same thing I

312
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,680
mean we add the animation time which was

313
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,130
point 5 and now we have 0.3 plus point 5

314
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,270
divided by 180 yay okay we know the

315
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:29,540
exact exactly where to put our keyframes

316
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,210
how do we implement this well we can

317
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,370
leverage the power of SAS because we

318
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,870
need a different animation for each

319
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,610
different circles so stats allows us to

320
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,430
do this quite concisely okay I said

321
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,500
concisely so let's take a look at the

322
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,320
first the the first and the only mixin

323
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,990
that we need which is exactly what I

324
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,390
just said but implemented in code so you

325
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,030
have a mixin that takes the circle

326
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,820
number the animation time the total time

327
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,440
and the delay amount and does the same

328
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,930
keyframes that we just saw one for zero

329
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,950
percent one for the percentage the

330
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,780
calculated percentage for the frames one

331
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,600
for 100% and one for the calculated

332
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,350
percentage for the third frame okay and

333
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,970
then how do you use this you just make a

334
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,720
for loop with SAS and for each circle

335
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,820
you use this mixin to create an

336
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,160
animation the animation proper animation

337
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,890
for the circle and you apply it like we

338
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,670
saw earlier by the way this code is

339
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,320
gonna be up later if you want to take a

340
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,610
look at as a reference blah blah blah we

341
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,600
have our animations and it kind of looks

342
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,530
a bit like this so yeah we have our

343
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,910
animation with with CSS and sass

344
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,630
do note that this creates a whole lot of

345
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,240
CSS cues you have to create four

346
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,980
different animations for each of these

347
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,589
circles and if you had 20 they need the

348
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,370
20 animations which is kind of know a

349
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,630
lot more than you'd want but I've used

350
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,689
this animation for loading so it makes

351
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:18,270
sense to have just something ready and

352
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,459
so you don't need to load the library to

353
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,500
show the users something so that he can

354
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,030
load while he loads cool so that was a

355
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:32,159
bit to take in how many people work from

356
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,340
home sometimes okay yeah so we have a

357
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,640
few I can't do that because of this you

358
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,960
try to concentrate with that thing

359
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,460
staring at you anyhow let's move on

360
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,440
green sock is a JavaScript library for

361
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,799
animations and let's take a little break

362
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,390
down a bit about the pros and cons of

363
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,549
green sock so first it has a really

364
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,400
great robust API so you can do quite a

365
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,059
lot with it every conceivable type of

366
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,240
animation that gets complex the API

367
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,120
allows you to do it allows you to do

368
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,710
dynamic animations like I said earlier

369
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,720
if you need something that changes

370
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,900
dynamically or that has uses physics or

371
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,659
something like that you can hook into a

372
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:24,750
green sock and use that and in handles

373
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,880
browser inconsistencies so this is

374
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,130
especially true in cases where you work

375
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,039
with SVG's and SVG is notorious

376
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,190
notoriously differently implemented

377
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,380
across different browsers so greens are

378
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,289
kind of unifies that but nothing is

379
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:43,799
perfect like I said earlier you know

380
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,960
it's a Java library so you need to load

381
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,049
that JavaScript features extra bandwidth

382
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,280
parsing time it's not a big library but

383
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,299
still JavaScript as you might have

384
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,710
already come across that is

385
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,980
implementation sensitive so if you have

386
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,740
stuff running on your main thread which

387
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,630
locks up the main thread maybe you're

388
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,330
doing complex calculation or analytics

389
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:06,990
goals

390
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,640
that takes too long for some reason or

391
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,790
something like that that would halt the

392
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,210
execution and make the animation jacket

393
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,280
so you need to be sure that your

394
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,750
JavaScript execution is as optimal as

395
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,340
possible so that the animations

396
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,020
themselves don't stagger or Jakob and

397
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,300
lastly some advanced feature of this

398
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,190
library cost money which is not

399
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,809
necessarily a bad thing because I guess

400
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:36,179
the amazing team behind it do need to

401
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,120
feed themselves somehow so like I'm all

402
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,559
up for giving them money but I'm not one

403
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,880
of them so it's not like Philly or

404
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,030
something and how do you do the same

405
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:54,150
thing with green sock that's it so let's

406
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,590
take a look at how this thing works

407
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,030
in green sock we have something called a

408
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,700
timeline which is if you ever work with

409
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,309
flash is kind of like the same concept

410
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:09,090
where you post animations on stream of

411
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,100
events called the timeline and so we

412
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,960
create a new timeline called timeline

413
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,309
Max and we make it repeat minus 1 which

414
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,520
means repeat this animation exactly not

415
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,700
one time actually means repeated

416
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,300
infinitely and we specify repeatedly

417
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,840
that means after the animation is done

418
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,300
wait a bit and then repeat it and then

419
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:42,600
we use this we use this stagger from two

420
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,770
handy function call which essentially

421
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,940
means take a bunch of elements spans in

422
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,900
this case these are these are the spans

423
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,550
that I'm talking about and stagger each

424
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,220
and every one of them so stagger animate

425
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,860
them one after the other this is the

426
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,510
duration of the staggered we saw earlier

427
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,800
0.5 seconds and the start the from

428
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,280
second is from 0 pixels to 60 pixels and

429
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,110
then the stagger time is the amount of

430
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,820
time again that you wait between

431
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,640
and then you have it like with few lines

432
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,460
of code which is pretty cool okay but we

433
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,650
can do more so I talked about doing

434
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,130
dynamic animations how does that work

435
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:41,610
let's have an example how come my errors

436
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,690
was so large okay

437
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,820
so in this example I have the exact same

438
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:53,270
animation only now I can click on it and

439
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,800
it reverses me animation and this is one

440
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,000
of the strengths of dynamic animations

441
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,600
you can once you have a timeline you can

442
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,840
hook into the API of that timeline to

443
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,030
control it so you kind of scrub through

444
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,320
the timeline the same way you would

445
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,290
scrub through a song or something like

446
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:16,650
that

447
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,870
you just take the animation start

448
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,110
playing with it and that's that pretty

449
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:29,460
cool okay huapi I'm just like I have so

450
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,630
much fun saying that even though so YP

451
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,670
is an animation API that's currently

452
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,730
implemented in Firefox Chrome and if I

453
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,180
remember correctly but not fully you

454
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,830
have to look at the table to see what

455
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,180
you thought because it's constantly

456
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,820
changes and the idea behind it is that

457
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,410
as developer you can hook into the

458
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,630
JavaScript into the CSS rendering engine

459
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,170
that you have when you do CSS animations

460
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,450
but you hook into them using javascript

461
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,360
so instead of animating using javascript

462
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,030
you just set up the animation using

463
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,340
javascript and then the browser takes

464
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,710
care of the animation as it would have

465
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,000
if you would implement it in CSS button

466
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,140
and dynamically what did I just say okay

467
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,610
so here is the same exactly mation but

468
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:32,160
this time it's implemented in in wacky

469
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,000
so

470
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,650
not going to go through each of the

471
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,390
lines but essentially the same

472
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,630
calculation that we saw for the CSS is

473
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,780
applied here you calculate the offset of

474
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,670
each frame using the same calculation

475
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,700
and give it the same property that you

476
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,800
would and for each of the circles you

477
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,080
use the wacky function animate to tell

478
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,300
it okay this is the animation that you

479
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,400
want to make so instead of having to now

480
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,070
specify in CSS for different animations

481
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,900
and loading them you specify them in

482
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,270
runtime and have the browser take care

483
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,590
of them so it's kind of like a mix

484
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,990
between having an all-out JavaScript

485
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,010
library do do the thing and in all CSS

486
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,150
animation in doing it's kind of like

487
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,820
taking some of both worlds to create

488
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,210
this new thing okay so by now you must

489
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,390
be asking great I just showed you three

490
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,940
ways of doing the exact same thing which

491
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,050
one should you use and the answer like

492
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,740
with any other of these type of things

493
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,910
that you ask yourself when you're doing

494
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:41,340
development for the web is it depends

495
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,440
simply because the by the way this this

496
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,830
is a amazing code penned by yeah but by

497
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,220
a Rachel Smith which just I love ok

498
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,350
anyhow why should you use one over the

499
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,190
other it really depends on your use case

500
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,980
so like I said earlier in my news case I

501
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,280
did the loading animation so you don't

502
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,810
when are you doing loading animations

503
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,340
you don't want to users to load and

504
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,590
other things just so you can see the

505
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,360
loading animation but if you have

506
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,210
complex load like animations that you

507
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,310
need to synchronize with one another and

508
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,170
the unit they need to start at a certain

509
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,230
point or start at a certain time or stop

510
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,080
or maybe you have an animation where it

511
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,030
happens on a mouse over something starts

512
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,950
to happen but then on a mass huh mass

513
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,770
out something else needs to happen it's

514
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,290
really really difficult to do this with

515
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,930
with CSS it's easier to do them with

516
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,840
JavaScript but maybe there's a way to do

517
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,990
the with webby as well so it's really

518
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,640
not a one solution for everything

519
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,330
instead it's best if you kind of know

520
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,270
the method

521
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,920
that you have like the tools your

522
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,930
disposal like the ones I just showed you

523
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:56,150
and use the ones appropriately okay if

524
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,610
you need want to read more about this in

525
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,130
not a talk form but an article form I

526
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,220
wrote an article CSS tricks called

527
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,150
repeatable staggered animation three

528
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,730
ways jiseop and web animation API catchy

529
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,060
I know but it has all the or at least

530
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,470
most of the information that you just

531
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,590
saw and you can kind of dive deep into

532
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,050
it into both the calculations and

533
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,370
different options that you might have

534
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,930
and there's some good discussion in the

535
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,520
comments there on different

536
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,200
implementation methods so thank you so

537
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:35,380
much both for me and from Glaser

538
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,740
and before you go out to fetch your

539
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,260
coffee I have one tiny small request

540
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,350
from you and that is my wife is left

541
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,540
home taking care of lizard and I want to

542
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,000
show her that it was worth it for me to

543
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,799
go here so I'm gonna take a selfie with

544
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:52,250
you

545
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,750
can we have the house lights please yes

546
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:06,960
no yes no yes no please okay I'll do it

547
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,620
