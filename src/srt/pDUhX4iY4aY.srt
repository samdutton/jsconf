00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:31,900
like him - oops

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,410
welcome to D world 67 three one six one

7
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,660
he has spent your whole life on the

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,150
ground always curious and fascinated but

9
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,769
a gently humming machines around young

10
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:53,690
knowing their jobs sustain your

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,879
community for whatever cause a big

12
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,010
calamity that force your ancestors

13
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,589
underground decades ago it was already

14
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:02,600
receding people are recently starting

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,309
wandering outside the heavy vault doors

16
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:07,040
exploring your desolate surroundings the

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,140
reestablish connection to other

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,030
settlements definitely came handy when

19
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,860
you managed to port your bulky operating

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,840
manual and started discovering the

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,520
depths of the technology that is at the

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,869
beating heart of your underground

23
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,720
habitat a newly a port as newly

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,240
appointed chief wall technician you were

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,829
tasked to use this knowledge to improve

26
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:26,240
the life of your community and you have

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,280
every intention in doing so so hi my

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,750
name is a spawn smashing ski and now you

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,520
know exactly why I just stick with flock

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,460
II I'm a freelance developer originally

31
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,409
from Budapest Hungary I live in Estonian

32
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,960
dam I spent quite some time in Asia in

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,549
the past few years but this is actually

34
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:44,780
my first time in Korea

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,060
except that one transfer in chat Airport

36
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,969
so I'm really looking forward to seeing

37
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,469
a bitter soul at least after the

38
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:53,810
conference I'm a missile attack speaker

39
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,810
tech speakers is a program by Mozilla to

40
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,639
support its community members teaching

41
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,469
at speaking a conference is holding

42
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:03,859
workshops and generally educating people

43
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,780
about open web technologies and the open

44
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,140
web in general I also work vet Mozilla's

45
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,360
devrel team where I help steer their

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,160
community efforts including the tech

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,319
speakers program itself and evangelizing

48
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,180
open web technologies especially someone

49
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,840
the bleeding get soft like web assembly

50
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,860
service workers or the systems

51
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,140
programming language rust and you know

52
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,420
if you have no idea what can browse the

53
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,950
system programming language do with the

54
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,870
open web will get there so hold that

55
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,830
thought and be following closely the

56
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,990
developments are and web assembly and

57
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,849
related technologies first some time now

58
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:40,100
and I also participate in the web

59
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,930
assembly community group that is driving

60
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,210
the evolution or the specification and

61
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,819
the expand

62
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,200
showing off Vegas Emily's feature set

63
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,530
and you know you could be too yeah you

64
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,359
don't have to be a compiler engineer or

65
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:55,260
work at a big influential company to be

66
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,420
able to do this the community group

67
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,180
operates until the w3c but it's open to

68
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,650
participation for anyone who is

69
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,629
interested if you just go to web asami

70
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,609
or click over to community you can

71
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:07,560
actually see all the many ways and learn

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,909
more about the many ways you could

73
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,439
contribute yourself in this talk I will

74
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,689
mention some of the many ways Mozilla

75
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,019
and people working at Mozilla

76
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,540
contributed to the creation and the

77
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,790
evolution of APIs Emily and I haven't

78
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,919
been involved with the work myself

79
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,319
there is now an entire dedicated team at

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,310
Mozilla for dedicated for working on the

81
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,870
beginning the leading edge of web

82
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,090
technologies and shaping web assemblies

83
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,769
future occasionally there if I have

84
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,930
positions open so if you would be

85
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,760
interested in being part of that work or

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,799
just want to learn more and about it

87
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,209
feel free to reach out to me and I'm

88
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,019
very happy to connect you them with them

89
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,069
before we dive in there is one more

90
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,489
caveat this is not a talk to teach you

91
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,159
about male hub lab assembly looks like

92
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,549
or how to generate web assembly code

93
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,530
there is great documentation a couple of

94
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,379
online paid grounds toriel's

95
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:07,769
if you decide already that this is

96
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,120
something that interests you this talk

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,939
is before that how do you get there how

98
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,659
do you know if you know how do you know

99
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,150
if if you should care about meth

100
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,159
assembly in the first place or why

101
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,690
should you care about web assembly in

102
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,199
the first place I've tried to show some

103
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,360
pointers to that and and if you do

104
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,340
decide to dive in after the talk there

105
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,139
is plenty of resources link later in the

106
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,800
slides due to the nature of technologies

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,389
discuss here with them there's always a

108
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,250
fair chance for any factual information

109
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,620
regarding yadda yadda nobody really

110
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,419
needs those disclaimers anyway the gist

111
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,580
of it is really just you know this is

112
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,949
highly volatile working progress stuff

113
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:50,219
so my change significantly even like any

114
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:51,780
time so before you push this into

115
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,880
production be sure to do your own

116
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,870
research and now with that

117
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,180
out of the way let's get back to our

118
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,460
favorite what technician who is about to

119
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,139
learn a valuable lesson couple hundred

120
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,240
pages into your newly acquired operating

121
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,190
manual you still seem to be stuck with

122
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,290
historical tropes from the era where

123
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,150
horse-drawn carriages roam the streets

124
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,400
all this time there is not a single bit

125
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,199
of useful information or anything

126
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,139
hands-on to be found on any of you

127
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:23,570
you've all systems like what a waste of

128
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,790
time in your son in federal raise you

129
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,740
angry toss the manual out onto the

130
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,810
corridor it flying right past one of

131
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,810
your elderly fathers you've apologized

132
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,210
profusely explaining your situation but

133
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,030
the ole mangies losses reply imports a

134
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,120
lifetime of wisdom oh dear

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,460
actually history provides the single

136
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,260
most precious kind of knowledge amongst

137
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,110
all there are invaluable lessons to be

138
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,270
learned from the context exposed by past

139
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,630
history and and this is true history

140
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,210
provides context Skepta sister world's

141
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,039
webassembly may often be rooted in the

142
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,800
fact that very few are familiar with the

143
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,289
technologies evolution influences goals

144
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,870
history in short of course we can't

145
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,520
really expect every developer to know

146
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,250
exactly what arduous journey have abbess

147
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,020
only has been through just to get where

148
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,090
it is today follow take a stab at

149
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,380
highlighting some and a few may

150
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,720
moderators some real issues of the web

151
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,180
platform and the solutions Robison aims

152
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:29,110
to provide

153
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,030
but wait lucky okay okay that map

154
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,919
assembly Decemeber suddenly that what is

155
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,139
web assembly well webassembly allows

156
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,690
code that was written in any of a wide

157
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,150
variety of programming languages to be

158
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,699
run securely on the web you take the

159
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,440
original source or source code of a

160
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,510
supporting programming language it is

161
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,580
compiled while using the web assembly

162
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,400
tool chain into your size and execution

163
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
speed efficient binary format that can

164
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,520
be used on the web executed safely at

165
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,830
close to negative speeds inside the web

166
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,610
browser close to native speeds here

167
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,680
refers to the fact that the execution

168
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,840
speed of webassembly compiled binary is

169
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,270
in many cases today are able to approach

170
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,550
the performance of the same source code

171
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,310
when it's compiled to the native

172
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,200

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,180
it's fast safe execution on the other

hand means that refers to all the

175
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,800
various ways the during execution even

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,380
before execution the web assembly

177
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,200
runtime ensures certain security and

178
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,320
safety guarantees and these are strictly

179
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,690
enforced by the the runtime that runs

180
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,010
the web assembly code which means

181
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,229
running this 4-part occurred on the

182
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,599
user's machine which remains safe robust

183
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,050
and isolated from the rest of the page

184
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,789
while all the same time retaining all

185
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:58,310
the speed guarantees there is a let me

186
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,229
give you a golden tour of the history

187
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,020
before 2012 that was likely what I call

188
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,120
the primordial period you know dinosaurs

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,660
jQuery except JavaScript has been

190
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,250
steadily increasing in speed since like

191
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,800
2008 when v8 was released and and that

192
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,229
kind of like whipped up a browser verb

193
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,870
and like all JavaScript engines were

194
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,400
completing video they were trying to

195
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,020
increase the Indy Java at the speeds

196
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,840
into JavaScript it still wasn't enough

197
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,690
you can never have enough speed so smj

198
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,959
SD booted in 2013 it was created as a

199
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,349
easy to optimize javascript subset that

200
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,229
compiler stand when tools could directly

201
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,790
used to directly target

202
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,040
to generate code that we run in the

203
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,920
browser browser JavaScript engines had

204
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,780
specific optimizations for this kind of

205
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,540
code so they were fast in supporting

206
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,580
browsers it was even possible to compile

207
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,610
entire games and 3d engines with barely

208
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,170
any changes to the original source code

209
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,840
with a SMGs and just run them in the

210
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,020
browser at comfortable speeds it you

211
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,600
know it was a super fast but like it

212
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,680
worked really well it's spiritual you

213
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,300
could call spiritual successor

214
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,370
webassembly was released in 2015

215
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,950
all four major browsers actually shipped

216
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,780
support in a few months by time period

217
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,120
and it continues to be actively

218
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,020
developed now I not really going to

219
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,610
teach you an actual history lesson I

220
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,500
think it's more interesting to actually

221
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,120
take a look at some of them some of

222
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,030
these key features and have a look into

223
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,110
how they came to be so web assembly has

224
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,970
been built on a core principle that

225
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,010
could be summarized as augment not

226
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,920
obsolete this means that it focuses on

227
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,290
CMOS integration really striving to

228
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,690
extend and complement the existing web

229
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,580
platform rather than trying to compete

230
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,090
with it

231
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,370
in fact web asami modules are largely

232
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,040
in-app inert without the Emperor's

233
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,780
cooperation and don't expose any

234
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,580
features beyond those that are already

235
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,780
available to Jas better here means the

236
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,060
host environment so the browser is one

237
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,950
and such but there are quite a few other

238
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,980
Emperor's these days in the case of the

239
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,960
browser JavaScript everyone could save

240
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,850
it some simplification that we Baba

241
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,250
suddenly today you won't be able to do

242
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,430
anything that your JavaScript doesn't do

243
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,310
already but what you could do is you

244
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,870
could be probably put a potentially

245
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,230
faster after the embedder actually

246
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,680
instantiates your web assembly module it

247
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,320
allocates its own memory so your Marisa

248
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,620
module will have its own memory and the

249
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,440
embedding runtime will pass it all other

250
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,540
resources it needs this means dekes

251
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,460
imports an expert's the function calls

252
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,100
of requires and the live model module

253
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,720
after this itself is largely

254
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,180
self-contained and very has very limited

255
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,680
access to its

256
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,279
my man this is also known as the

257
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,080
principle of least privilege you only

258
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,700
want to provide a verse and a module

259
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,560
with access to resources that you you

260
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,149
are pretty sure the exactly needs and

261
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,670
nothing more API calls that need to

262
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,250
access the network or storage still need

263
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,779
to go to the JavaScript runtime or

264
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,990
browser api's and the module might have

265
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,270
hooks into the system api's and other

266
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,300
JavaScript bindings that were passed in

267
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,279
or it may request services such as more

268
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,950
memory by the JavaScript API but

269
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,959
embedding the embedding environment has

270
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,450
the offer to deny any or such requests

271
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,000
and which means wherever suddenly module

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,860
is highly dependent on the cooperation

273
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,320
of the embedder itself there are

274
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,480
actually even more implied proposals

275
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,620
that are there are of the web assembly

276
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,029
standard that are working towards

277
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:44,959
deepening and extending this integration

278
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,430
the cooperative and complementary

279
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,990
relationship actually predates web

280
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,510
assembly and I mentioned a SMGs was a

281
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,250
JavaScript subset and that is still

282
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,100
practically JavaScript but it's true

283
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,660
billions lies in the fact that the

284
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,910
changes required for supporting SMGs

285
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,010
optimizations were so minimal that our

286
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,770
browsers a large browsers wanted in so a

287
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:10,260
SMGs feature set was soon enough one of

288
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,450
the amount after the other all modern

289
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,459
browsers has shipped support for a SMGs

290
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,470
optimizations in their engines and the

291
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,900
cooperation of browser renders outlived

292
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,990
SMGs following its success the people

293
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,820
who worked on a SMG I started exploring

294
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,810
ways to and the work that is needed to

295
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,709
fix the SMGs inherent shortcomings for a

296
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,690
casual observer rabbits only is often

297
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,029
perceived as simple usually this refers

298
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:38,240
to the highly constrained features that

299
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,040
after shipping a SMGs it became clear

300
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,839
that some of the shortcomings cannot be

301
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,550
fixed without actually breaking the web

302
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,040
or just reimagining how the architecture

303
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,010
worked and this and this pong a lot of

304
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,240
explorations which eventually converged

305
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
into what we call the web assembly MVP

306
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,930
today develop assembly MVP this this

307
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,100
collaboration

308
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,620
made way for the web assembly MVP a

309
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,980
minor might

310
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,400
viable webassembly this was like a

311
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,530
robust extensible and future-proof

312
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,700
foundation that was laid out even in

313
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,590
this like diverse setting like you

314
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,850
Microsoft and Apple collaborating and

315
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,010
more contentious issues so there was a

316
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,750
minimal feature set and the more

317
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,910
contentious issues were set aside to

318
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,580
bake for some additional time or you

319
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,200
know P to be informed by some of the

320
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,410
early adopters this left webOS suddenly

321
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,340
in a constant state of evolution at the

322
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,200
and as the community group the designs

323
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,690
additional and enhancements based on the

324
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,870
implementers feedback but it's not the

325
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,500
only thing that mmm

326
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,190
that webassembly had had access to so

327
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:05,560
this so this might seem like that it was

328
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,980
not only the specifications resource

329
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,920
constraints that caused web assemblies

330
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,990
simplicity but it was also a deliberate

331
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,540
design choice the entire specification

332
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,790
is around 100 pages the instruction set

333
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,980
or the formal definition on the runtime

334
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,410
fits a single page and you know these

335
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,190
are some some star sentences out of the

336
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,710
specification itself no computation can

337
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,660
crash or otherwise misbehave in way is

338
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,880
not covered by the execution semantics

339
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,120
given in this specification this

340
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,780
robustness stems from the fact that the

341
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,750
web assembly runtime itself is very very

342
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,690
simple very straightforward this

343
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,750
property the safe and secure execution

344
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,760
at consistently fast close to native

345
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,100
speeds on all target platforms is

346
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,320
already hinting towards use cases beyond

347
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,060
the web but let us not get ahead of

348
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,800
ourselves and just talk a little bit

349
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,380
about what creators on the web had to

350
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,970
gain first almost a year have passed

351
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,470
since you first got your hand on your

352
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,260
first operating manual slowly but surely

353
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,210
you have become more handy around the

354
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,090
wall fixed this rebuilt that even gained

355
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,130
some notoriety for some of your

356
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,310
creations and

357
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,680
knowledge you occasionally get visitors

358
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,050
from other vaults seeking your advice or

359
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,210
experience you cannot not formally

360
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,430
remember that one time when you almost

361
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,160
not the poor fellow wall dweller

362
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,090
unconscious with the book and

363
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,670
frustration of being useless he smiles

364
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,529
he put the finishing touches a new piece

365
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:41,360
of machinery areas that verge to life

366
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,970
will lightly squealing as you push the

367
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,680
big green button why should you Babb

368
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,960
some more often it's not immediately

369
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,540
easy to see the benefit of technology

370
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,630
for once your own use cases but this

371
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,740
doesn't mean that it doesn't have any

372
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,120
industry testimonials finding the idea

373
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,760
use case you often takes time and rarely

374
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,190
happens without export to research and

375
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,830
experimentation industry testimonials

376
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,839
that report significant gains from

377
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,089
making use of FSM they almost never fail

378
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,710
to mention the vending road they have to

379
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,020
embarked on before the true benefits of

380
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,620
the technology started shining through

381
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,670
one of the first and Judah state most

382
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,980
major tools used in the ecosystem is I'm

383
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,920
scripting a c-plus Oz compiler for ASM

384
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,170
GSM web assembly in script is as old as

385
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,240
the entire ecosystem it was born and

386
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,420
then Co evolve alongside a SMGs when we

387
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,440
have assembly rolled around them

388
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,000
scriptum was one of the first tools

389
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,220
there to support it as an old

390
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,380
photographer format and script a made it

391
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:45,950
possible

392
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,280
easy even to compile large pre-existing

393
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,440
code bases libraries or even entire apps

394
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,470
sometimes millions of lines occurred for

395
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,230
the web not the most prevalent use case

396
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,839
web use case I'll admit but surely not

397
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,390
many of you had ever the sudden urge to

398
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,150
ship a triple-a game title to a vanilla

399
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,150
web browser I guess furthermore one of

400
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,650
these not offering these compiled

401
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,630
bundles you know you input a lot of code

402
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,610
you get out a lot of code and then up

403
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,650
tens or even hundreds of megabytes which

404
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,199
is a very scary figure considering the

405
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,630
ever-increasing bloat of the web today's

406
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,939
web sites all this is to say that this

407
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:25,209
inner certainly found or even funded

408
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,470
enthusiastic niche or following for

409
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,780
compiling for the browser but stay quite

410
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,960
far from becoming mange

411
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,480
even for those who not writing their own

412
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,160
games and astral class apps Emscripten

413
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,470
was still useful though one could write

414
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,630
a smallish module in a low-level

415
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,160
programming language like C or C++

416
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,190
compiler and use it in one's app to

417
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,260
surgically replace the performance

418
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,720
sensitive parts or use it to target the

419
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,930
web as one of their platforms one would

420
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,400
need to be able to write code in a

421
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,930
low-level language as well as write

422
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,240
JavaScript blue code to discuss two

423
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,670
modules rarely making these their most

424
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,770
reusable most portable pieces of code

425
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,340
ever written but it worked and Tripta is

426
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,830
not the only way though rust was one of

427
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,720
the first level first low-level Lang

428
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,820
systems languages that not only added

429
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,590
built-in support for web assembly target

430
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,360
but it took one sir took it one step

431
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,890
further and even doubled down and

432
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,570
supporting web assembly as a first-class

433
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,320
citizen

434
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,900
high-performance robots memory guarantee

435
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,940
stellar dogs sophisticated tooling an

436
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,310
extensive library of crates which is

437
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,280
third party modules building from the

438
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,050
npm on d on the fret of npm the that

439
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,570
could be imported and reused in an NPM

440
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,430
ish fashion made Russ an ideal choice

441
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,650
for someone who wanted to go deep but

442
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,870
unwilling to deal with C++ shenanigans

443
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,940
and you know if I'm preaching rust

444
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,310
that's because I am a huge fan so I

445
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,830
actually run a Russ conference ourselves

446
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,840
in Europe but if you don't want to go

447
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,460
that far there's a Russ Tokyo conference

448
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,260
happening in October so you should

449
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,440
definitely check that out of course not

450
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,480
everyone can or wants to learn a code

451
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,280
and a low-level language just to get

452
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,180
 done assembly script is a provides

453
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,370
done assembly script is a provides
a language for this with much familiy

454
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,350
much more familiar semantics to all

455
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,140
JavaScript developers it's like a subset

456
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,750
of typescript and it serves as a much

457
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,520
lower barrier of friendship for creating

458
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,740
web assembly modules bespoke vasami

459
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,210
modules for web developers but to quote

460
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,310
Surma you don't need to understand all

461
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,930
of this to be a good web developer or

462
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,910
even to make good use of web assembly in

463
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,330
the first place Surma here in the

464
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,340
curator post he means that one doesn't

465
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,250
need to be using bespoke tooling just to

466
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,810
be able to create a wrap assembly module

467
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,840
in one project

468
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,580
and surely and Krypton or just using

469
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,770
pre-compiled Watson modules will go a

470
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,820
long way

471
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,240
we tools like assembler script and more

472
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,950
and more languages adding direct support

473
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,380
webOS purpose-built components will also

474
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,930
fry but even so it's hard to imagine

475
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,120
that offering webassembly modules will

476
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,360
become a mainstream task undertaken by

477
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,160
the majority of web developers and

478
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,440
that's perfectly fine it shouldn't be

479
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,559
the good news is one does not need to

480
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,059
know where but some really know about

481
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,550
web assembly to be able to benefit from

482
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,929
the new technologies ecosystem effects

483
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,490
proposals such as interface types

484
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,620
proposal the web I do bindings for the

485
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,250
ongoing

486
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,020
yes module integration currently

487
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,960
underway are working towards integrating

488
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,670
web assembly modules even more

489
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,410
seamlessly into the ecosystem in the

490
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,500
future one you would just import a

491
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,150
module using your favorite package

492
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,640
manager and it could and it could be

493
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
using web assembly under the hood

494
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,690
without the use of me even being aware

495
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,809
of the fact in the first place also even

496
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:49,429
if once production code won't end up

497
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:51,620
using web assembling one might still

498
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,950
benefit from WebAssign Levi bell tolling

499
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,550
that pack was one of the early

500
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,460
experimenters who had really good

501
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,250
results promising results trying to use

502
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,740
web asana for improving build times with

503
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,450
recent announcement around interface

504
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,280
ties by the muscle of AB assembly team

505
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,740
this already pretty futuristic sounding

506
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,780
paradise might be closer than you would

507
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,260
think

508
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,080
but let us have a glance at a slightly

509
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,730
even more further odd potential of

510
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:24,230
ramasammy well modern nature certainly

511
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,360
didn't stop coming up with bizarre new

512
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,400
ideas while you and your compatriots

513
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,559
were hiding in your cozy underground and

514
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,440
embrace of your vaults the swirling

515
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,290
display of almost a dozen tales and this

516
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,030
weird-looking animal as you emerge from

517
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,950
the Walt Amana evening this Channing

518
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,040
chills down your spine hard to call it

519
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,500
nightmarish as you're pretty sure you

520
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,750
could never even dream up such a strange

521
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,970
creature was it what is it is it

522
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,570
friendly

523
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,600
or is it hostile yes you will find out

524
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,040
soon enough

525
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,950
and sure enough you know it's tough to

526
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,930
predict the future of a nascent

527
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,970
ecosystem and webassembly is no

528
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,860
different we know if you don't really

529
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,410
know where all of it will end up until

530
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,300
we actually get there someone the

531
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,490
currently discussed post MVP features

532
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,220
garbage collection integration by by DL

533
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,770
integration till calls framing to name a

534
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,280
few

535
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,350
will make it possible for more languages

536
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,570
to target an inter interoperate with the

537
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,090
web this also includes more exotic once

538
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,100
you know languages that look much less

539
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,620
like JavaScript today and this is of

540
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,870
course not you if you live in a beige of

541
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,240
Babel and typescript and element reason

542
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,280
but babbling to make this process even

543
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,070
better and the edges are much faster

544
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,300
this is not only interesting from a

545
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,710
technology standpoint but also

546
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,300
increasing the diversity and

547
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,010
accessibility of developing for the web

548
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,250
allowing people to use whatever language

549
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,990
they feel the most comfortable with

550
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,850
rather than maintaining one particular

551
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,280
man on the web will make their Evette

552
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,230
platform much more resilient in the

553
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,300
future because of every language wanting

554
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,130
to run in the browser now suddenly you

555
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,930
have a common low-level layer they all

556
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,950
support people watch India about quote

557
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,630
something that is frequently observed

558
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,300
the web platforms gravity have given

559
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,700
Babis and the adoption an incredible

560
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,370
boost but not all use cases necessarily

561
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,860
need to involve the browser sure the

562
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,390
verb may be an excellent medium to

563
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,490
popularize the use of Ibis ami but the

564
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,590
same modules could later be adopted for

565
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,290
or in certain cases just ran out of the

566
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,720
box in any verb assembly compatible

567
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,920
right around time and well I would

568
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,180
restrict ourselves to the browser

569
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,250
wherever Semmy seems to have properties

570
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,050
that could come handy in various other

571
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,450
contexts to you wouldn't a would it be

572
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,250
possible to take some of the values of

573
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,500
sake and safe and secure sandboxing into

574
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,850
the in the browser

575
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,370
beyond the web at webassembly would it

576
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,410
be possible to still provide enough

577
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,660
power and flexibility required by all

578
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,790
the other use cases these are the

579
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,070
questions that are being explored in the

580
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,910
sister specification of webassembly the

581
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,070
web assembly system interface or huazi

582
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,280
for short what would it take to take

583
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,450
them assembly into the

584
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,150
restricted environments and providing

585
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,460
more capabilities still retaining most

586
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,200
of the safety guarantees that make the

587
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,100
map so unique what he is another

588
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,800
tremendous effort in reimagining certain

589
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,110
aspects of computing that we simply just

590
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,000
never question and take it as a given

591
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,400
that the proposal initially presented by

592
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,950
Mozilla but there's no word on in in its

593
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,120
own subgroup of the web assembly

594
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,070
community group and has a potential to

595
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,810
XM rebus and his usefulness in a

596
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,450
standardized way across a variety of no

597
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,880
map use cases and you know if you squint

598
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,730
at it the web embedded cloud at the end

599
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,920
of the day you might realize that what

600
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,840
seem based vastly different are actually

601
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,240
closer to each other than if Fang code

602
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,860
size constraints on a web app you know

603
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,600
reducing bytes and food while your may

604
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,100
correspond to requirements on edge

605
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,650
computing servers storage limitations or

606
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,870
sync time as well as microcontrollers

607
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,120
which has very limited memory we can

608
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,830
already see that it's not only that

609
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,900
webassembly is making its way to all of

610
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,730
these other platforms but it motivates

611
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,620
the creation of small self-contained

612
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,530
libraries that is feedback to a

613
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,630
transitive effect into the web ecosystem

614
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,710
and when we have all done done all that

615
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,460
why stop there what if anyone could use

616
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,310
the language of your choice program but

617
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,320
we didn't stop at programming languages

618
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,450
or different paradigms but we went all

619
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,760
the way to liberating programming of the

620
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,270
anglocentric human language what if

621
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,400
learning programming didn't have to

622
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,350
start with learning English or the Latin

623
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:42,920
alphabet

624
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,960
what if you weren't hindered by knowing

625
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,850
the difference between what and if is or

626
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,940
what a4 is what if you could write the

627
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,780
code entirely in Korean for example

628
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,240
Ramsay Nasir is the rather well-known

629
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,340
creator the first Arabic programming

630
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,020
language it's called Gelb

631
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,510
the phone doesn't support so you will

632
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,780
see the expanded URL on the on the

633
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,020
bottom of the slides he has an

634
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,540
astounding and far provoking talk from

635
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,280
the construct conference earlier that

636
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,090
explored ooh

637
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,690
almost there

638
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,000
a topic in our talk from deconstruct

639
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,260
conference earlier this year they're a

640
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,110
sport how a purely language agnostic

641
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,450
programming language where paradigm

642
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,700
could look like his design prototype

643
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,860
actually builds on web assembly as the

644
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,840
underlying machinery berroco storage

645
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,640
with code fragments living in the

646
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,560
distributed web accessible for anyone

647
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,870
with language specific metadata layered

648
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,990
above to give everyone a chance to write

649
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,850
and reuse code in their own native

650
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:53,260
tongue I don't have unfortunately any

651
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,300
links for this but as soon as the talks

652
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,830
recording welcome and I will put them

653
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,900
into the slides so it said web

654
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,580
assemblies potentials is seemingly

655
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,130
limitless in this case its properties

656
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,620
are low-level binary format and platform

657
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,690
agnostic disposition made it an ideal

658
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,760
choice for something truly fresh and

659
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,600
unique the only question is what the

660
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,880
only question that remains is what will

661
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,720
you do with that Asami yep thank you

662
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,910
very much I would like to find the

663
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,440
Missoula web assembly team for their

664
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,150
amazing work on the home base and in

665
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,280
general have you Hoffman P Lihue dobro

666
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,320
and gestures for had their help and

667
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,210
support and reviewing their stock Ling

668
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,870
Clark for the amazingly detailed cartoon

669
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,310
deep ties which are laying later on the

670
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,370
inner resources section

671
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,780
Jeff Womack Alexandra Pope and Ling

672
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,570
Clark who influenced in big ways just

673
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,580
the format of this talk and the

674
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,680
organizers and especially Susan for

675
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,010
putting up in me and figma who for their

676
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,830
incredible in browser director editor

677
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,240
built bit was him that uses Moslem

678
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,490
actually many of the graphics for their

679
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,290
stock was actually created almost all

680
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,850
graphics on further stock was created

681
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:08,890
but figma and but that I think I have

682
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:14,200
one more thing as you as I can see him

683
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,330
they're big zeros on there I wasn't I'm

684
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,070
bored I was running hurry blow out of

685
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,350
time so I couldn't fit a demo in there

686
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,560
anywhere and I was like but the walkie

687
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,360
you should have fitted demo in there so

688
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,360
I when I decided you is to you know make

689
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,290
the slice the demo itself so if all goes

690
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,220
well

691
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,170
you can see the slides link on the below

692
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,420
talked out flock dot is slash wasn't

693
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,470
such as golf Korea if I exit here you're

694
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,790
gonna see the slide talk it's just a

695
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,760
regular web page the regular web page

696
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,430
with regular images that has regular alt

697
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,190
tags on them so everybody can access it

698
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,960
with a screen reader you can see the

699
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,390
talk you can see all the notes when I

700
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,660
enter presentation mode javascript

701
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,910
imbibe assembly kicks in the online

702
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,500
version doesn't have the experimental

703
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,360
web assembly it has the experiment or

704
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,020
Java Script kit what happens here this

705
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,370
nope this effect that you see on the

706
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,560
stage is generated by webassembly

707
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,740
reinterpreting the webpage which means

708
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,630
you can use the web as you could use to

709
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,000
before and he can use the web assembly

710
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,360
to augment the currently existing

711
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,140
possibilities on the web so with that

712
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,890
thank you very much

713
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:38,100
and thank you again
