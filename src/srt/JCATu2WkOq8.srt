00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,710

hi Leon yeah okay cool

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,859
how's everyone doing how amazing is Jase

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,639
conf Iceland so far yeah okay stop I

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,470
have a talk to make so let me start with

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,480
confession I less than three JavaScript

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,800
JavaScript is amazing and weird and pure

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,340
and awesome and strange javascript is

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,009
the only language I know of where you

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,100
take your code run it through an igloo

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,809
fire on it to then run it through a

11
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,260
predefined and I mean we've created an

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,660
ecosystem that allows people to

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,420
contribute so much that now we

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,280
constantly complain when people

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,940
contribute things and javascript is

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,800
everywhere so my browser runs JavaScript

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,070
my server runs JavaScript my TV runs

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,260
JavaScript my washing machine

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,390
well that doesn't run JavaScript that

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,030
probably runs C++ but only because you

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,400
need pointers and memory management when

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,490
you're handling soft fabrics and and

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,340
according to some TV shows JavaScript

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,360
can even run weapons guidance systems

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,580
well only if you're using jQuery that is

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,900
like if they haven't uploaded the code

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,909
to github so I didn't test it yet but it

28
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,060
looks legit so we just is is you know

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,180
it's ubiquitous everyone uses it and you

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,689
can you know do everything with it but

31
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,189
you don't have to trust me like you

32
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,110
don't have to trust what I'm saying you

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,899
can trust this book from 2003 literally

34
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,460
titled how to do everything with

35
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,649
JavaScript and this book teaches you

36
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,920
amazing things like version one point X

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,710
or version 2.0 new stuff okay

38
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,500
so javascript does a lot of things but

39
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,140
I'm here to show you maybe things that

40
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,330
you weren't we thought weren't possible

41
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,810
of JavaScript or kind of off the beaten

42
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,709
path

43
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,110
the cool thing about web technologies is

44
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,840
that they allow all of our ideas the

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,959
good and interesting ones as well as the

46
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:31,680
dumb and silly ones okay so my name is

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
at offer v I come from you from Tel Aviv

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,359
Israel where the spoken language is loud

49
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:48,030
Hebrew and you might not notice but my

50
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,940
name offer in Hebrew means fun you know

51
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,690
like Bambi not sure why I just told you

52
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,019
that does seem important at a time I'm a

53
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,739
designer a musician I'm sometimes a

54
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,739
gamer and it turns out that javascript

55
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,659
is really good for all of these things

56
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,829
so that makes me a developer in my day

57
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,530
to day work at a company called echo as

58
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,109
a creative developer what exactly is a

59
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:19,230
creative developer according to some

60
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,340
definitions those being my definition

61
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,290
that means someone who works with other

62
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,799
creative people like film maker game

63
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,560
makers musicians designers to do all

64
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,470
sorts of cool interactive things on the

65
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,980
web and I want to start by telling you a

66
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,349
little story about myself and how I got

67
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:42,989
into web development so the year was

68
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,079
like 97 or 98 and I was 15 years old and

69
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,690
I was spending a weekend over at my

70
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,099
grandfather's and it is there that I

71
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,120
found a book about HTML and that book

72
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,239
was mesmerizing I remember working hours

73
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,209
of notepad and then Netscape for like

74
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,519
trying to to figure out like what this

75
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,150
thing does and I read about this amazing

76
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,519
technology called links I allow you to

77
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,900
connect one web page to the other web

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,060
page and that seemed amazing like that

79
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,329
seemed but the problem is it didn't work

80
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,099
so well for me like I didn't know what

81
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:25,710
was the problem like I I knew I did

82
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,960
something wrong but what was

83
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,050
like water song and then it hit me after

84
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,900
a few hours you see it's not called a

85
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,930
Herff element it's called a RIF element

86
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,449
cuz that makes so much more sense you

87
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,780
know riff and not hurt anyone you

88
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,830
understand why I didn't have a

89
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,639
girlfriend until date is funny what fast

90
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
forward a few weeks later and my I had

91
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,240
my first website up on Geo CDs does

92
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,699
anyone remember Geocities yeah I don't

93
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,840
care it looked kind of something like

94
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,500
this

95
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,410
[Music]

96
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:11,860
actually it looked more like this and

97
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,330
you know you're laughing at this because

98
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,420
it's you know it's hilarious but we

99
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,160
didn't have fancy technology back then

100
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,490
we didn't have CSS and the cloud or any

101
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,130
idea what we were doing we had to build

102
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,010
our websites with nested tables I mean

103
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,350
these kinds of nested tables and long

104
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,720
not long after like I honed my skills I

105
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,420
worked on making websites in the early

106
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,130
or late 90s that is and I finally as a

107
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,590
teenager was able to make some pocket

108
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,770
money by making websites for companies

109
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,170
so like one of the first websites I've

110
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,930
ever made an actual company paid me

111
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,230
actual money for this thing and I don't

112
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,110
know it looks like this like maybe shoe

113
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,120
shaped sidebars were all the rage back

114
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,840
then but uh the funny thing about this

115
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,220
is that it actually has a button that

116
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,980
allows you to turn off JavaScript how

117
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,430
that's an amazing feature but okay

118
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,840
enough about me and my sense of

119
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,950
nostalgia nostalgia let's talk about

120
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,280
JavaScript so what is javascript jscript

121
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,350
allows us to add functionality to

122
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,410
websites so turn them from static things

123
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,600
to interactive experiences so take a

124
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,750
look at this simple phone input number

125
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,660
phone number and put for example so you

126
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,680
know it's style 9 through CSS but this

127
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,360
has a slight issue because like if you

128
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,730
want to use this you need to like point

129
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,460
your mouse at the input and then you

130
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,900
know use the keyboard to input your

131
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,160
numbers and like that's just inefficient

132
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,170
that's inconvenient you'd say like maybe

133
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,390
we can add buttons so that you don't

134
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,950
have to use the keyboard if you don't

135
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,080
want to so okay that's really easily

136
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,110
solve JavaScript let's advance there

137
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,660
problem solves like now the user can

138
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,210
just click on that bounty which is his

139
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,000
or hers phone number and we're done and

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,830
I know what you're thinking like this

141
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,600
isn't this is a joke this is an

142
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,840
inefficient method of inputting numbers

143
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,940
so yeah I know I hear you let's fix that

144
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,830
that let's make this more efficient with

145
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,210
JavaScript there we're done and and I

146
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,540
know where it's like where we're already

147
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,130
we're already there

148
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,260
but we can continue improving this I

149
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,050
mean JavaScript gives us so much power

150
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,740
and strength we can make this just

151
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,800
better for all of us all of our users we

152
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,940
can just you know you can endless so I

153
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,310
studied design at the Bezalel Academy of

154
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,280
Art and Design in Jerusalem which is one

155
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,650
of the best design schools in Israel

156
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,320
with one of the worst design logos in

157
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,110
Israel like I don't know what they were

158
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,979
thinking it's like I can't even okay so

159
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:08,470
when I when I studied there I came to

160
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,040
realize just how amazing would it be if

161
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,880
we can connect technology and art and

162
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,100
what technologies allow us to do that so

163
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,860
check out this example from mental oh

164
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,550
yeah and here we see using canvas and

165
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,169
JavaScript an interactive generative

166
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:32,620
artwork where every time you click you

167
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,740
get something completely new so every

168
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,130
user that but that just plays with it

169
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,880
gets his or her own artwork how amazing

170
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,670
is that and that's JavaScript I mean

171
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,240
this just you know just code just just

172
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,890
script and this creates these amazing

173
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,570
patterns but you can take this a step

174
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,780
further you can transform this into 3d

175
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,500
for example so this one from the Google

176
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,990
later arts team generates does

177
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,550
generative machines via 3GS and WebGL

178
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,530
and JavaScript so every time you click

179
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,900
generate you get this new machine this

180
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,470
beautiful thing that is generated from

181
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,170
seemingly randomness or another example

182
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,370
would be this example where you have

183
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,959
procedurally generated all tiny

184
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,540
airplanes so every time you click on the

185
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,820
next button you get this new flying

186
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,400
machine and that's that's super cool if

187
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,930
you want

188
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,600
learn more about generating things I

189
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,730
should I definitely recommend you to

190
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,590
take a time machine and go back into

191
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,170
Kate captains talk yesterday and if you

192
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,180
don't have that then when the talks are

193
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:49,240
up you should check that so these are

194
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,040
all personal experiences so you see them

195
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,320
on your computer on your own personal

196
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,930
monitor but just script can do so much

197
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,530
more it can go out of your personal

198
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,620
monitor and turn into a public thing so

199
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,710
this by this work by marpie a Polish

200
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,410
base polish-born SAN francisco-based a

201
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,860
digital artist lets users play and

202
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,250
generate 3d objects and worlds using the

203
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,550
3GS and the HTC vive so this is an

204
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,820
public and art piece in a public public

205
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,320
space and users can then take the things

206
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,910
that they did and print them in their 3d

207
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,760
printer and you can even go bigger than

208
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,960
that so there is a country somewhere

209
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,670
closer than North Pole or so I've heard

210
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,160
called Iceland and there they have

211
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,230
sometimes they do a conference where you

212
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,660
can actually paint on the building where

213
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,210
the conference at if you ever get a

214
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,370
chance I definitely recommend going to

215
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:55,930
that conference but but but art is a

216
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,800
really good way to to learn and

217
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,950
understand things it's it's a service a

218
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,690
good way to and the learning tool so

219
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,210
this is a project like a self project I

220
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,910
made while I was studying design and I

221
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,380
was really obsessed with the idea of

222
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,830
evolution so evolution has a really hard

223
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,750
concept to understand and visualize

224
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,350
because you have like mutation and and

225
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,000
survival of the fittest and time and

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,740
generations so I thought like maybe I

227
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,030
can create something that will help me

228
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,910
understand it so I did this little coat

229
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,160
pan with just you know canvas and

230
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,740
JavaScript and this has digital

231
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,960
creatures with very simple rules big

232
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,880
creatures eat little creatures little

233
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,259
creatures eat food

234
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:45,819
those creatures run away from Bigfoot

235
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:47,979
creatures and then you get this like

236
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:53,199
from simple rules this amazing system

237
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:55,239
which it's kind of like a virtual

238
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:58,329
aquarium that you can look at and all

239
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,569
these emerging patterns arise and it's

240
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:04,179
just mesmerizing it's just you know

241
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:07,089
simple JavaScript so I thought okay how

242
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:10,539
can we take that a step further and I

243
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:13,600
turned this into 3d you know because 3d

244
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,389
are it's always nicer but the cool thing

245
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:17,739
about that is the web is all about

246
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:19,809
sharing so you can share your experience

247
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:22,179
with someone else so I thought about if

248
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,639
I have my aquarium and you have yours

249
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,709
what would happen if these two

250
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:30,279
ecosystems would were to meet so if I

251
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,799
have my creatures and I open a portal up

252
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,869
to your browser where you have your

253
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:36,879
creatures well how would the two

254
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,759
ecosystems interact which well one of

255
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,549
them completely obliterate the others

256
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,589
will new creatures arise like that's

257
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:45,970
super cool that's something you can do

258
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,739
just by typing javascript and hitting

259
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:50,410
refresh a lot of the times how amazing

260
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,600
is that but there are different ways to

261
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,509
do learning so one of these is machine

262
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,749
learning and JavaScript also allows you

263
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:01,059
to do that so Jeff's - it might not be

264
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,829
like the first thing you think of when

265
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:05,679
you think about like machine learning

266
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,919
but turns out that's the possibility so

267
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,470
deep learning GIS is a machine learning

268
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,069
like library in JavaScript and I'm gonna

269
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:17,199
show you an example here and the way it

270
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,149
works is that I'm gonna play a little

271
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:22,480
melody and then via machine learning

272
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,419
we're gonna hear another melody that's

273
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,699
based on what I just played so I just

274
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:36,910
write this out

275
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,949
I didn't say it's gonna be a good melody

276
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:44,420
just that it's kind of work okay and if

277
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,629
we're on topic of music music videos so

278
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:50,359
I remember again as a kid watching being

279
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,519
glued to the screen watching MTV and

280
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,769
which one and those all were passive

281
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,970
experiences but the web allows us to be

282
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,679
interactive so this is kind of an three

283
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,889
dreams of black where you have 2d

284
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,679
animation 3d animation whatever the

285
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,540
other points the mouse like the stream

286
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,569
of animals run around on the building

287
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:18,079
and that way every user gets his or hers

288
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,959
own personal experience and it doesn't

289
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,319
end there

290
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:26,720
so this video clip for 4-acre decades

291
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,919
fire reflector uses WebGL and shaders so

292
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,869
wherever you point the mouse like

293
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:34,660
there's an image manipulation there and

294
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,519
also some 3d where the the dancer in the

295
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,699
video has this 3d thing overlaid on top

296
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:47,029
of her which you can play super cool

297
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,480
stuff and I mean the options are endless

298
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,049
this video by real estate is an actual

299
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:56,480
like canvas that you can paint on to you

300
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,089
like here I tried to tame the sky blue

301
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,189
this is really hard when the video keeps

302
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:03,139
moving but you know it gives you

303
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,910
something to play with for your you're

304
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,980
creating art on top of someone else's AR

305
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,449
and this is something that's only

306
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:13,040
possible due to web technology the next

307
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,389
project is something I'm really proud of

308
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:15,799
is something I did at work

309
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,989
this is the official video for Bob

310
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,509
Dylan's like a rolling stone so what

311
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:22,100
happens here is you have sixteen

312
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,309
different channels of video and in each

313
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:27,709
different Channel the characters in the

314
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:31,189
video are lip-syncing to Bob Dylan Dylan

315
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:34,879
and song and then the user can pick

316
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,309
which channels watch so instead of

317
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:40,999
watching one music video you're like

318
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:44,299
kind of creating your own personal music

319
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,730
video and again this is like web video

320
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,750
it's just

321
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,850
you know what could video player in

322
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,680
JavaScript and there are challenges here

323
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,040
but it's just pointing your browser

324
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:03,560
somewhere and seeing this pull so okay

325
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,970
you can clap it's okay that's one of the

326
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:11,569
things we do one of the ultimate forms

327
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:13,970
of interactive entertainment is video

328
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,519
games subjects really close and dear to

329
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,819
my heart and video games come in all

330
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:22,579
forms and sizes especially on the web so

331
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,620
video games can be something really

332
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,519
small like this mini game and the

333
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,620
website for the magicians a sci-fi TV

334
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,980
show where they use canvas and HTML and

335
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,379
some video to create some engagement

336
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,410
while you're watching while you're

337
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,779
interacting with the website or a video

338
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:44,569
game can be like a 2d thing this is a

339
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:47,449
game I made to teach kids concepts in

340
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:50,029
evolution have I mentioned that I like

341
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:55,100
okay nevermind this was done with 2d

342
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,110
library called phaser which is based on

343
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,129
a renderer called pixie but you know

344
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,470
again you can let take this to 3d so

345
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,949
this is an actual 3d pinball game

346
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:08,780
running in the browser and the

347
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,209
interesting thing here is that there's

348
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,370
physics involved there's a library

349
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,990
called p2 physics in the background

350
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,569
actually doing the calculations so you

351
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,059
have physical simulation again running

352
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:22,250
in the browser but everything that we

353
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,230
just saw is a single-player experience

354
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,049
so it's just you sitting in front of

355
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:29,120
your computer or mobile or whatever

356
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,780
playing but the web again is all about

357
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,429
connecting people it's all about sharing

358
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:38,350
so the natural step from this is

359
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,120
multiplayer games players that have many

360
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,470
players this one called Wanderers IO by

361
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,059
game developer and designer called

362
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,820
resinar gives you control over a tribe

363
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,190
and then you fight other tribes for

364
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,600
resources for land and that's super cool

365
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,669
I mean games are usually written things

366
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:01,200
like C and C++ to be close to the

367
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,970
mell or whatever but then you have to

368
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,210
download drivers and update your

369
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,669
graphics card and you know all these

370
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,649
things but what if you just point out

371
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:13,289
your browser to webpage and just play

372
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:14,850
with someone else without having to

373
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,240
download anything so that is what I had

374
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,750
in mind when I wrote this library Lance

375
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,750
would you can find Lance DG and Lance is

376
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,700
a kind of a server and a client that

377
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,610
allows people to create their own video

378
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,460
games online video games web video games

379
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,960
without having to worry about writing

380
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,929
net code or synchronization or all the

381
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,370
ugly stuff that I had to pull my hair

382
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,070
over to do and what can you do with

383
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,340
Lance so this is a game that I made with

384
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,880
Lance

385
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,630
it's called sprocket league and it has

386
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,639
nothing to do with any other game with a

387
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:54,149
similar name but in this game each

388
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:57,059
player controls a car and these car

389
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,960
these cars actually play soccer and you

390
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,100
you this runs with 3d physics engine

391
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,380
running on the server on the client and

392
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,110
again this is all web technologies this

393
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,360
is all stuff then you can do with just

394
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,289
notepad you shouldn't do this with

395
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,409
notepad but you can if you want to okay

396
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,950
another really cool technology that

397
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,260
that's up and coming but also out there

398
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,350
is web assembly or its precursor ASM

399
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,610
which essentially asks you to take other

400
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,789
languages like C or C++ or could be

401
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:38,370
anything and compel them to binary that

402
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,070
the browser can understand and then you

403
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,289
have the browser running something

404
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:47,100
that's far more effective at computation

405
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,010
so what does this help us with an

406
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,470
example we'll be porting the entire

407
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,820
unreal game engine which is like a

408
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,260
serious thing web a game engine and run

409
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,940
it in the browser using WebGL so what

410
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,519
you're seeing here is not JavaScript it

411
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:04,380
wasn't written in JavaScript but it runs

412
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,510
in the browser and JavaScript can

413
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,519
interface with this and web assembling

414
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,260
is going to be gratefull a lot of things

415
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,919
that are computationally expensive like

416
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,149
audio manipulations video

417
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,609
filters everything that needs some juice

418
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:21,450
powering it but I am excited about a lot

419
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,719
of things that have to do

420
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:27,599
Bertrand and running in browser so what

421
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,229
if and bear with me what if you could

422
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:34,979
run windows 3.11 in the browser how

423
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:36,629
amazing would that be so you could just

424
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:39,839
like open up paint and do something or

425
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,460
you can like open up so later you could

426
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,549
completely completely reimagine how was

427
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,259
it when you were sitting in your mom's

428
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:53,969
basement in the 90s and this gets us to

429
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:56,909
their next technology which is what

430
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:59,909
virtual reality or what we are so maybe

431
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:02,039
you've heard about this but a way to

432
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,769
learn about subjects that I don't know

433
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:07,440
is to a way that I like is to look at

434
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,440
stock photos of that specific thing so

435
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,080
if we look at stock photos of web we are

436
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,539
we can learn all sorts of things like

437
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,749
for example what VR is kind of taking a

438
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:20,879
stroll up in nature and maybe we have

439
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,029
rainbows coming out of your crotch or

440
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,999
maybe what we are is sometimes being

441
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:30,389
attacked by really old phones or or

442
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,679
maybe you don't need to put anything

443
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,049
like you maybe you not need to put VR

444
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:35,999
goggles to be in what we are maybe you

445
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,799
just need to take headphones and then

446
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,349
put them on your eyes and pointed

447
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:43,429
something and that works just as well

448
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:46,679
but we are and what we are specifically

449
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,599
is all about putting you inside a

450
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,190
virtual world so in this example you're

451
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,330
in this musical landscape we have we

452
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,070
have sound yeah okay and and we have

453
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,960
these

454
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,880
cute tiny creatures where everyone does

455
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,700
has its own little sound and you can

456
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,660
kind of play around with them in this

457
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,520
thing but virtual reality is a

458
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,330
oftentimes product of 3d models and like

459
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,040
something that's completely virtual and

460
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,910
at work I did something really cool it's

461
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,610
this project called broken night which

462
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,370
is a film a live-action film which

463
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,740
showed in the Tribeca Film Festival last

464
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,860
year starring Emily Mortimer and the

465
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,010
idea here is that you're inside this

466
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,200
film you can control it so the plot for

467
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,480
this without too many spoilers is that

468
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,950
there is this couple and they had an

469
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,420
argument and they they're coming back

470
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,450
home and then there's an intruder in the

471
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:57,190
house and you get to live that moment so

472
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,320
you have like for example the two

473
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,980
characters the man in the woman and she

474
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,060
takes the gun and then as a viewer you

475
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:13,590
see the pass and wherever you look

476
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,000
that's where the story is going to take

477
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,100
place so does the guy get the guns as

478
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,260
the girl get the gun you get to choose

479
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,800
and then you actually sync this

480
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,140
interactive video this story that you

481
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,510
would prefer to see so the story is not

482
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,740
linear it's completely interactive cool

483
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,400
right this leads us to our next thing

484
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,060
which is web augmented reality or as I

485
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:45,250
like to call it web are and if virtual

486
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
reality is all about putting you in the

487
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,930
virtual space augmented reality is all

488
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,490
about taking the virtual space and

489
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,100
putting it in the real space in the real

490
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,500
world so this example from Disney

491
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,680
research allows you to take like a

492
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,050
tablet and point it at a kid's coloring

493
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,390
book and whatever the kid draws like

494
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,530
comes into life in 3d so recent

495
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,980
developments in AR allow you to actually

496
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,800
do that or at least potentially do that

497
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,300
in the browser and there was a talk

498
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,470
about this by race

499
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,690
yesterday also suggest that you check

500
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,320
that out so we talked about web PR and

501
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,750
we talked about where they are and today

502
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,370
there is a new buzzword that if you

503
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,009
combine these two technologies it is now

504
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:34,860
called web X R or web extended reality

505
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,700
and I know

506
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,820
Mozilla is pushing hard on a standard

507
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,460
that to progress this forward and I know

508
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,259
I'm joking but this is like super cool

509
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:49,899
stuff so the last last thing we're going

510
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:53,169
to talk about as the physical web or the

511
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:57,159
internet of thing is and there are a lot

512
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:59,860
of interesting stuff going on there so

513
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,769
one of these is no BOTS which is a

514
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:07,259
movement that aims to get JavaScript on

515
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:12,669
actual robots so for example if you have

516
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:15,879
a robot and you have node and if your

517
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:19,690
computer is in Spanish then you can

518
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,840
actually control the robot via

519
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,929
JavaScript and that's pretty cool to

520
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:30,269
Mai's or or you can do something more

521
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:35,049
you know something better you can make a

522
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:39,159
cat remote control so all you need to do

523
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:42,490
in order to get that as needed Arduino

524
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,470
and you need the johnny-five JavaScript

525
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,539
library and you also probably need a cat

526
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:51,850
that's a requirement or how about

527
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,580
controlling and drone from your browser

528
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,850
on your phone so this is done via web

529
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,860
Bluetooth so this example from Peter

530
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,889
Shaughnessy shows how he's using

531
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:04,179
javascript in his browser on his phone

532
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:07,480
to connect to a drone and just fly it so

533
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,850
there's no app you didn't down Lenny

534
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,210
have to do this just like JavaScript API

535
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,169
and this works today on mobile chrome

536
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:20,200
and also on Samsung internet which turns

537
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,049
out is a browser but super super cool

538
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:26,110
that you can do that so everything that

539
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,460
I just showed you is is out there in the

540
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,419
wild you can just

541
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:34,239
use that right now what what does the

542
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:34,959
future hold

543
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:38,039
what does what's coming up next so

544
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:41,320
according to West world an HBO sci-fi

545
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,299
show about AI robots that run a theme

546
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:49,629
park these AI robots are written using

547
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:53,499
react so I saw Dan dance talk yesterday

548
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:56,320
he didn't say anything about robots but

549
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
maybe that's like in the next version I

550

553
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,669

558
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:23,919
gives you a little perspective this was

559
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,919
the first web server ever that Tim

560
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,549
berners-lee used in CERN and it

561
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,009
literally had a sticker that says this

562
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:33,969
is the Internet

563
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:38,109
don't power it down and this was the

564
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:41,589
first website that was used but then it

565
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:44,349
showed and you know what a what a way

566
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:47,559

567
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,899
do today with web technologies I mean

568
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:53,259
