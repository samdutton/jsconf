1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,219

okay so we hit through a lot of

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,040
technical talks today so I know that

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,859
anyway started now so i will make

4
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,740
something less technical more funny or

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,529
something like that so i will talk today

6
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,789
what do we why do we need two eyes and

7
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:30,599
maybe i will start from myself yeah I'm

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,369
a JavaScript developer from Poland the

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,829
country not so far away from here on

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,940
east west yeah on the right and the map

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,760
had between Russia and their money and

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,059
I'm open web game developer and my main

13
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,489
topic of interests or games but we had

14
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,170
today in a couple of today and yesterday

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,949
a couple of game game dev ducks so I

16
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,649
will try to present something different

17
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,320
and I'm an organizer of on being star

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,949
that was the first thank you that was

19
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,159
the first html5 game dev conference in

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,990
Poland last week thank you and I creator

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,680
of some kind of ridiculous and

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,710
completely useless web demos like CSS

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,800
the end cap

24
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:33,710
yeah and I'm html5 game dev kappa couch

25
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,460
in w3c as well yeah and that's all yeah

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,229
I know that's boring so let's talk about

27
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,130
eyes now uh why we need two eyes first e

28
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,429
okay first of all one sorry one moment I

29
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,740
have so big ears that is hard to me too

30
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,069
no fight with that microphone first of

31
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:57,959
all one eye is not enough do you ever

32
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,209
heard of any creature animal anything

33
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:03,360
with only one eye yeah we had something

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,909
like a couple of thousand years ago

35
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,039
probably and and it's it's the history

36
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,000
now right so we so one eye is not enough

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,910
for us and what about three you ever

38
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,530
heard of any animal with three eyes yeah

39
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,629
what about cats what about cats yeah so

40
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,799
usually gets her only two eyes but there

41
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:34,440
was one there is uncut in u.s. we've

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,510
three of them and maybe i will present

43
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:50,699
some kind of demo now

44
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:58,610
it's on the about 30 seconds so so he

45
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,730
has two names he's known as a tennis cat

46
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,250
after the Roman god with two faces and

47
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,849
at 12 years old is the longest-lived cat

48
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:10,040
of his kind the fact that just earned

49
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,310
him a spot in the Guinness World Records

50
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,709
howdy his own find such an unusual time

51
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,280
he was brought in veterinary school I

52
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,079
used to work there he was brought in at

53
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,440
a day old to be euthanized and I said

54
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,659
I'll take him you know and they let me

55
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,540
take him what was it the truth he was

56
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,819
just so unique but I had he been at just

57
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,439
a normal kid and I probably would have

58
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,210
taken him also if nobody else's too

59
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,720
friendly than it just a normal kid and I

60
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,900
probably did you outside eyes are the

61
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,329
ones that see so okay I think it's

62
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,720
enough

63
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,500
well so I don't know if you heard that

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,040
the lady said that the middle I'd is

65
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,620
blind so even if the cat had three eyes

66
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,780
the nature force him to head only two of

67
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,600
them and yeah two is the answer and two

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,170
is kind of magic number in our culture

69
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,600
and not only ours because for instance

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,910
back in mid 70s the there was some kind

71
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,070
of expedition or how to call it

72
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,580
discovers a village somewhere near yeah

73
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,320
Amazonian River I don't know how to call

74
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,880
it the river in English but that the

75
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,760
biggest one okay cookers and they never

76
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,450
met any other civilization and they go

77
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,700
like ah yeah culture and everything was

78
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,260
based only on three numbers they know

79
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,540
only three numbers 12 and more and yeah

80
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,120
that that makes the number you need okay

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,270
so what about our eyes and brain ice

82
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,750
itself are not able to see anything it

83
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,570
it does you know the ice are just like

84
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,840
lance or can kinda tool for our brain to

85
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,040
analyze the images we see and true and

86
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,590
produce the scene we we can remember

87
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,130
after that so for example yeah our eyes

88
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,520
are had about five centimeters space

89
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,510
left between them so basically what we

90
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,220
what we see all the time or two images

91
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,770
in the same time right I think if you're

92
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,420
younger you try to experiments like

93
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,400
putting your fingers on some object

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,810
close one eye sea and the finger isn't

95
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,090
the same spot and now oh no is about you

96
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,240
know couple of centimeters on the other

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,990
side so yeah and it basically looked

98
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,330
like that so we had the view from the

99
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,380
left I in here view from the right I and

100
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,450
our brain is analyzing the images and

101
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,050
creates the scene we we can see after

102
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,070
that and and okay

103
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,020
analyst what are anaglyphs anaglyphs are

104
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,570
images because yeah basically basically

105
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,110
everything in 3d in game development and

106
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,820
in stuff like that is about cheating

107
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,690
right so we try to cheat our brain so we

108
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:21,070
try to mmm yeah we try to combine two

109
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,400
images from two separate views into the

110
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,460
one and we use glasses like that word

111
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:37,050
for this because in here yeah sorry yeah

112
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,230
because in here when we manipulate with

113
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,530
the colors of one image and manipulate

114
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,110
the colors of another image just to

115
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,170
disable the red one in in that one for

116
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,230
their right for the right eye and the

117
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,290
blue and green for another one we can

118
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,680
provide each image to two separate to

119
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,380
separate I just using the glass like

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,060
that right so and I think it works like

121
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,310
I made it yesterday during the

122
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,780
conference okay so yeah it's kind of red

123
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,540
stuff right no it's all the scalp and so

124
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,290
basically the anaglyphs are as old as

125
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,050
the photography itself we call that the

126
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,640
science about creating three-dimensional

127
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,570
images stereo stereo stereoscopy yes sir

128
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,390
it's really late now and that is the

129
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,970
first photo ever taken by a human being

130
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,210
barber bite by the human and it's from

131
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,610
back 1826 and yeah I think that one is

132
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,170
better because that is the first the

133
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,260
first photograph weaved up with the

134
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,560
people on there because it tooks really

135
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,800
a long time to you know create something

136
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,050
like that and only the one guy in here

137
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,030
was was playing his shoes that way he

138
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,530
was standing there a couple on hours and

139
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,020
that's why he's on the photo but talking

140
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,810
about anaglyphs in the same year in 1938

141
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,390
in England and France in the same time

142
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,430
there was

143
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,770
discovered that things I was talking

144
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,020
about before that if you provide two

145
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,700
separate images from the different

146
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,610
angles to to your eyes you will see the

147
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,810
Stan light at the scene like a

148
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,130
third-dimensional and first they they

149
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,550
created images like that and use yeah I

150
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,500
don't know the English word for that and

151
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,300
we call it photo plastic on in polish

152
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,220
but i think it's not not the proper one

153
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,270
and because in here you had s one moment

154
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,790
as you can see okay here in that length

155
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,670
you provide the image for one I for

156
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,440
their left one and for the right and one

157
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,310
in here and just couple of years after

158
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,310
that they discovered that anaglyph

159
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,220
techniques I I talked about before and

160
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,770
that was the first anaglyph image taken

161
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,790
ever in it was like 9001 something like

162
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,560
that and just after the people

163
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,070
discovered that we can make photos but

164
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,680
we can also make like moving photos

165
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,510
right we call it movies today they just

166
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,850
create one of the first yeah that's not

167
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,590
the first one but one of the first three

168
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,540
dimensional movie ever and yeah that is

169
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,450
now is the part when you will watch it

170
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:57,100
and I will drink some water

171
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,649
yeah okay so it was like like

172
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:09,720
grandfather of avatar okay so how how it

173
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,649
really works let's take two images yeah

174
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,899
it's from some kind of mortal kombat

175
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,439
fine art or something two images for

176
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:21,870
foreign our eyes that is the image from

177
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,930
our left eye yeah left yeah left and

178
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,829
that is for the right one and we can

179
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,959
manipulate it single pixel of the image

180
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,800
so let's remove all the red channel from

181
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,800
because the colors are construct from

182
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,829
three channels right right red green and

183
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:44,279
blue so let's remove all the red color

184
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,420
from that one and lived only read one on

185
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,819
another yeah up the opposite okay who

186
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:54,569
cares and then we have to combine the

187
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:57,630
images into the one and anyone used

188
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:03,509
Photoshop in here ever yeah okay so we

189
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,730
had something in Photoshop like blending

190
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,689
modes so you can you can just determine

191
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:14,850
how one layer is how one layer is you

192
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,380
know interacting with another one with

193
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,759
top layer with the bottom one and yeah

194
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,990
so basically we had it looks like that

195
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,029
in Photoshop but we had the same simple

196
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,120
formula for achieving that in yeah using

197
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,470
pixel manipulation because as I said

198
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,959
before we had three the a scholar is

199
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,339
combined from three different different

200
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,490
channels so we can just manipulate the

201
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,079
the number of values of the of the

202
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,089
pixels and we will construct the image

203
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,559
and it will finally looks like that it

204
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,980
works

205
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:59,220
okay uh so I know that it was fun right

206
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,370
but it is JavaScript conference so let's

207
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,529
make some live coding maybe and I know

208
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:09,750
that live coding never works but I will

209
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:21,930
try so basically hmm I have two images

210
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:28,140
from my last trip to Mars and and they

211
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,830
were making in the same time from that

212
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,410
funny thing you can see in here because

213
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,070
it has two lens on that like to two

214
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,810
separate photo cameras so it is the same

215
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,550
the same view but from a little bit

216
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:53,880
different a different angle so yeah I

217
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,580
preferred single document with my own

218
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:07,640
awesome implementation of jQuery in here

219
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:16,930
okay and and it is in here so basically

220
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,950
whoa is really okay maybe like that uh

221
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,620
so we have something we called canvas

222
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:35,110
yeah you heard of them okay and we don't

223
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,100
want to the images to be displayed on

224
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:49,210
the page so oh no it will be easier at

225
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,879
that

226
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,360
yeah it works nothing is displayed in

227
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,339
here so now let's use our awesome jquery

228
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:11,589
to take the left image and yeah and

229
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:16,990
canvas

230
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,470
and let's draw yet we need the context

231
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:30,800
as well

232
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:36,120
so let's draw the image like the left

233
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:44,980
image oh yeah first of all

234
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:53,460
yeah I know it's ugly but it works right

235
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:59,510
yeah and we throw it in the same point

236
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:05,940
and the origin yeah and it works so now

237
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:11,779
hey come on thank you you can fit about

238
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:17,589
it and now we have also something like

239
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:27,130
image data so we can take the image data

240
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,580
from our canvas from whole canvas right

241
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:38,030
so

242
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,079
and then from the image day in data we

243
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:49,519
can take the data of each pixel so I

244
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,089
hope it was something like that and yeah

245
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,589
for now yeah okay no one I hope no one

246
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:06,029
will notice that yeah sure and now we

247
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:10,170
have an array with the pixels and yeah

248
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:15,350
and it done should be like that for sure

249
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,230
okay so the first element of the ra is

250
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,389
the red channel the second one is the

251
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,579
green channel then the third one is blue

252
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,149
the fourth one for ya then the next

253
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:29,579
after the third one is alpha channel and

254
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,899
so on so we want we are not interested

255
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,300
in here in the green or blue channel so

256
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,540
we just want to clear the red color from

257
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:46,050
from the image ok and after that we want

258
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:56,519
to put that data that they turn into our

259
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,680
canvas yeah so that is the image without

260
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,990
the red color awesome and now yeah no

261
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,940
one will notice it again

262
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,500
we will yeah we don't need one that one

263
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,190
I don't okay so now we create an array

264
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,650
it's like really big array because each

265
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,110
pixel is represented by four values in

266
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:41,790
here and we will remember or dead pixels

267
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,390
okay because we needed and we needed

268
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:54,140
after after that so we had our yeah good

269
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:00,740
cat I was testing you and now we will

270
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:09,620
draw another image like the right one

271
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,740
yeah I love jquery it's so easy to use

272
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,740
and just 70 k of code okay uh what's now

273
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,510
sure so we now draw another image the

274
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:32,840
red the right one okay yeah just just

275
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,030
testing if yeah sure and blah blah yeah

276
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,530
we made place it basically the same

277
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,260
thing in here after after drawing

278
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:55,990
another image but after that we will

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,920
leave the red pixel I don't yeah we

280
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,040
don't need to go

281
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:15,159
and we will clear that

282
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:20,249
okay and let's try if it will yeah it

283
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:22,379
works so now we have two images and we

284
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,989
have to combine them and we have to use

285
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:31,559
that magic formula from here so the

286
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,849
result coral color is like some thing of

287
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:44,460
two other colors yes so basically we had

288
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:54,239
the red pix link you sure and now but

289
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,599
the top color is our well notes like

290
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:08,249
that sure the top color is in here yeah

291
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:14,909
and the bottom color is that one

292
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:21,190
and it works like that for all the

293
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:32,360
channels

294
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:41,260
uh yeah I hope it will work and yeah

295
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:54,059
what I don't heard what do you work yeah

296
00:20:54,059 --> 00:21:05,340
that's good cash in here yeah as I as I

297
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:20,920
said life coding is never yeah but still

298
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:35,680
yeah sure okay who cares

299
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:49,239
well it works

300
00:21:49,249 --> 00:22:00,879
okay so let's back to the slides slides

301
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:03,809
and that Batman is also anaglyph i made

302
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:05,730
like i spend like three hours to find

303
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:13,379
them okay so yeah so basically what we

304
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:15,649
what we've done now we just clear

305
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:18,090
completely the red color from one chant

306
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,419
from the 1i view and the green and blue

307
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,429
from another one but not that's not the

308
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,159
only way to produce anaglyphs because we

309
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,169
have other types of anaglyph like

310
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:30,509
through anaglyph and it that's the

311
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:33,889
formula in here in which yeah you can

312
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:37,350
product that that was yeah I don't

313
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,970
really know what what this one was used

314
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,779
for but for example that gray anaglyphs

315
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,109
was used by NASA and to producing

316
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:47,129
three-dimensional images from that

317
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:51,690
photos I've I've already show you uh out

318
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,879
but yeah we don't have colors in here

319
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:57,259
also that is that is an agree if we use

320
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:01,710
the just with the simple values and that

321
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,100
is the optimized one and probably that

322
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,340
it has the best the best results and i

323
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,859
will show you one one demo after i don't

324
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:15,200
know 30 seconds so what's more we have

325
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,919
like anaglyphs in our browser so someone

326
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,739
creates a jquery plugin yeah it's not

327
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:24,389
the plug in its most likely more like a

328
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:41,450
snippet but

329
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,700
yeah and it looks like three-dimensional

330
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,409
tags but it's really hard to read it

331
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:52,409
from but but but it works like and they

332
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:56,720
were thing yeah so I showed you just

333
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,760
during just a couple of seconds ago the

334
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,610
optimized anaglyph and it's used in

335
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,929
WebGL animations so the guy mr. do I

336
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:10,309
think everyone heard of femur or his

337
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:13,380
jobs never had all his other projects

338
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,419
and stuff like that so she creates a and

339
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,720
I live demo of renderer for WebGL so

340
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,760
it's completely a calculated on the

341
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,360
shaders so you just make your own WebGL

342
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,970
application as yeah as you drink before

343
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,399
and just put one additional five for the

344
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,350
renderer and it it creates additional

345
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,860
camera and calculate the colors on the

346
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:47,190
on the on the shaders and yeah pretty

347
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:55,700
nice isn't it

348
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:03,630
okay i know that anyone is tired so that

349
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:13,200
will basically be the end but no I have

350
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,960
one more faintest to present because as

351
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,360
I said before I really like an IRA

352
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,549
enjoyed creating very stupid things in

353
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:27,149
the way in the web so couple of a couple

354
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:29,190
of months ago on mozilla the most part

355
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:35,649
in Helsinki I created CSS nyan cat and

356
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:39,750
and now it has and now it has a negative

357
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:54,560
background

358
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,700
okay and that's basically everything I

359
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:09,130
know

360
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:17,610
questions for Michael thank you oh no

361
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:27,360
really yeah I think you had a question

362
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:32,930
wait a moment because sorry I'm a

363
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,690
complete noob with 2d graphics oh how

364
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,910
much of that can be optimized by the GPU

365
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,750
is it perfectly optimized is it but you

366
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,790
said about that WebGL renderer or know

367
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,830
the composition on canvas the

368
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,500
compositional canvas I think it you know

369
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,930
it's just a pixel manipulation so it's a

370
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,800
way faster than just drawing images and

371
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,300
for example I don't know if you heard of

372
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,910
impact engine by dominic's of let's keep

373
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,220
it creates one of the best html5 game

374
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,790
engines ever and he don't that he never

375
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,890
used draw image function of the canvas

376
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,320
you just you know manipulate each pixel

377
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,140
for rendering des price so i think it's

378
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:18,050
it's it's quite a good optimized yeah

379
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,050
sorry my english 34 now I'm retired yeah
