00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:15,939

[Music]

2
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,930
good morning everyone

3
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,070
okay sure you're not sleepy - okay I'm

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,039
actually a show today for this talk with

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,099
my college - person talks but he still

6
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,989
sleep when I went out he's not feeling

7
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,190
well so when when I will I was walking

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,379
here I stumble upon this gravity on the

9
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,039
a linear periodic road so it I just took

10
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
it two hours ago and I think descriptive

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,750
so provoking for me and it's true so

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,780
that with my teeth talks often force

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,600
okay I'm and I'm from when do I work for

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,450
if you see it it was an IOT stirrup in

15
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,750
upper cultures a confessors domain I

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,470
don't know if have anyone of you I first

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,460
see this kind of shrimp ponds do you

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,799
know where your streams come form your

19
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,970
luxury seafood dinner this this is

20
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,430
shrimp ponds and it's wonderfully spawns

21
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:34,229
and what is uh what else they do they

22
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,270
usually feeding they're faced recently

23
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,909
by this burst defeat human and this

24
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,720
causing a lot of downside for them

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,790
because our feeding could cause she's

26
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,960
dead and it happens in just a one night

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,570
offer a feed waste will go down the pond

28
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,640
and it will release the ammonia and I'm

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,939
gonna kill the fish so we built a

30
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,329
product like this and I do some hardware

31
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,090
I do some software I do some data but

32
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,180
most of the time I do nothing I just

33
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,470
talked with people

34
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,740
and actually we are practicing extreme

35
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,820
programming we caught by the pond

36
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,030
literally extreme programming okay

37
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,090
anyway I chest my title talks to simple

38
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,050
development rapid doesn't really mean

39
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,610
simple but simple could be can help us

40
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,060
wrap it and it was kind of absolute

41
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,480
title often first web it web but offline

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,050
first so what's on the menu we are

43
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,750
talking with offline first actually

44
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,630
single parts going out there my own

45
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,310
solution my and then we were talks with

46
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,370
an other walks in this kind of area so

47
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,050
just like everybody else before

48
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,090
can you please stress the hand if you

49
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,820
have have ever heard offline first okay

50
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,880
rigidity like I said 80% haven't heard

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,760
offline offers before okay so I first

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,440
know the terms of offline first like two

53
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,560
years ago we are building an application

54
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,630
an Android application for to be exact

55
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,540
and it's not working for our customers

56
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,780
and we found this site it's it's like

57
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,390
kind of movement it's like an

58
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,280
organization with it it's a little

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,190
community that talks anything libraries

60
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,800
lighting technology can that can work in

61
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,900
two countries so this it's like more

62
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,090
design actually design a fruits for

63
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,340
building application so it's not it's

64
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,239
more like a paradigm it's not abstract

65
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,830
concept it's a like paradigm how to

66
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,410
build application and so why you should

67
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,320
care always we should care

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,810
first thing rural areas yesterday

69
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,880
speakers from India Krishna or yep treat

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,560
nur talk about rural areas India so why

71
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,880
because they were marginalized by

72
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,080
technology I don't know if we are

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,030
creating technology for rural areas

74
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,150
beset nonprofit organization and social

75
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:36,470
cost in Africa or anything and this one

76
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,259
rural areas is one of our customers in

77
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,830
Indonesia and look at their Metro

78
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,210
perforates it was no internet connection

79
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,490
almost no internet connection on the

80
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,440
seashore so that one is in north of Java

81
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,919
if you have heard Java before Indonesia

82
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,550
not just Bali

83
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,539
I also meet people and where you come

84
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:05,069
from Indonesia or Bali Bali

85
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,740
oh no nobody I'm from Bandung Indonesia

86
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,020
yes Indonesia okay and this is data come

87
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,490
from 2016 we have three billions

88
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,389
Internet user but just 1 billion get

89
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,879
access for high-speed Internet it is one

90
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,900
third of total users and the others

91
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,000
still living with connection but not

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,460
necessarily good connection the first

93
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,069
one is India China and Indonesia my

94
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:46,800
country comes third so why why we we

95
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,729
call this world wide web but we just

96
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,279
make it for West wealthy Western web

97
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,020
it's not my quotes

98
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,289
it's from Bruce Lawson so it's not

99
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,629
biased from me but yeah I grew it with

100
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:04,139
him so did some what wide web should be

101
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:09,120
encouraged more and why people by 2050

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,379
we will have population boom I mean a

103
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:19,860
lot of people going multiplied merits

104
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,610
have kids every year every day but it

105
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,080
will be an unconnected work because

106
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,500
India China Indonesia will have a

107
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,330
massive population but I don't know if

108
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,460
our infrastructure technology or network

109
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,770
of roads will catch up really fast by

110
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,570
2050 and maybe

111
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,610
it was their first internet interaction

112
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:45,250
by smartphone I am sorry one of our

113
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,480
customers they just know it was

114
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,150
smartphone they told it was a small team

115
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,970
what control at first man he only span

116
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:03,250
like 2 gigabits quota but next year when

117
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,720
we come back again

118
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,550
his son using smartphone and spend more

119
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,870
than 20 gigabits quota I think wow ok

120
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,320
we thought we give them access and now

121
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,910
they are consume more internet but with

122
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,330
20 gigabits quota no his son playing

123
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,570
drone flying drones in rural areas

124
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,110
because he knows that oh this one drone

125
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,230
and where where where can i buy it so

126
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,770
absolutely

127
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,170
after she knows internet connection he

128
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,040
can learn much faster you can learn you

129
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,270
can gain knows anything by connectivity

130
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,570
ok that's good but it comes with a

131
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,990
drawback smartphone user we are living

132
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,240
in to 10 20 years before we are first

133
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,850
exposed to internet by except

134
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,970
application and there's another bear

135
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,000
it's barriers its design language icons

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,660
and anything it doesn't work with our

137
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,850
users because they know their first

138
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,490
interaction by smartphone so they don't

139
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,880
know what hamburger icon is what the

140
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,410
home icon is they just read the text

141
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,350
that's not a barrier and next

142
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,500
availability you won't have connectivity

143
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,390
to senior data so we have to remember

144
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,770
this and I took it from the distributed

145
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,630
system network fellows this network is

146
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,030
your enemy the network is never reliable

147
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,150
so if you think that network is variable

148
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,190
then you can have to wonder fallacies in

149
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,700
the submitted system

150
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,340
okay so I already show to you what's the

151
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,930
problem what's the initial cost and how

152
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,370
today's technology approach this problem

153
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,360
you know the traditional kinds of

154
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,600
remodels and this one is often force

155
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,900
model so with the traditional pencil

156
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:20,490
models we are really have to access the

157
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,090
cloud to get the page but in the often

158
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,280
first module the data the assets the

159
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,400
anything should be on the client side

160
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,190
well it comes progressive web apps comes

161
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,810
with the solution we have native look

162
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,220
like we have service worker we have

163
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,820
network Begaren sing and you need just

164
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,900
to create a manifest that can catch your

165
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,080
assets you need you have that work at

166
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,960
that you yeah you can intercept the

167
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,030
network request

168
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,650
so is it progress about ups enough

169
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,030
how about data synchronization how about

170
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,610
conflict resolution when your users

171
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,510
online you can transact data real-time

172
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,630
but when your us user offline and your

173
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,620
users mutate or modify the data how

174
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,180
about when they're coming online

175
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,970
how about to sing this data alright

176
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,460
first we have progressive web apps to

177
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,920
check the network we have network casing

178
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,100
but the other evolution it's not a

179
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,460
revolution the other movement progresses

180
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,100
is how to sing the data based on my

181
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,660
experience there's two type of

182
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,700
synchronization document state and

183
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,670
common state if you use what box yeah

184
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,160
yesterday that that was progressive web

185
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,040
apps workshop right if you use workbooks

186
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,480
and you use network break dancing and

187
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,400
network you can sing your applique

188
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,580
like groan they comment by storing the

189
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,910
net what's the request and execute after

190
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,010
you are online it was a it is a

191
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,470
convention that scene so let's see about

192
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,570
the document state I board from the

193
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,240
trailers synchronization architecture in

194
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,640
it was the first time I learned about

195
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,000
synchronization and cut the depend on

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,190
central object has to be implemented in

197
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,820
the client and they only send Delta's of

198
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,010
the data modification it was a

199
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,250
documented so you have a prior document

200
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,600
and your current document and you're

201
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,760
sending the Delta State it was a

202
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,980
document state and how about the

203
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,230
comments dead there's another libraries

204
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,740
really screwed us offline basically it

205
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,570
was right your request to store it and

206
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,640
then if you are coming online it will

207
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,420
execute your previous requests

208
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:10,560
sequentially and it and I was using this

209
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,350
kind of approach okay but it's terrible

210
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,970
if I use this the comments that sing and

211
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,209
comments that sing I still implement on

212
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,640
the back inside the synchronization

213
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,400
mechanism how to configure is looting

214
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,320
with users data and it all it was all

215
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,640
handled on the back inside it's a it's a

216
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,790
converse um and really not a good

217
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,850
experience for me and then you know

218
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,190
every my all from Google crossfire saw

219
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,470
it it is a beckon as a surface it comes

220
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,320
with reactive synchronization it comes

221
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,380
with offline support but it takes your

222
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,650
many way too fast

223
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,270
yeah too fast I wrote

224
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,100
little prototype when i--when five

225
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,030
storages comes out one years ago I think

226
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:19,890
a year ago I did some bad with

227
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,900
architecture or bad implementation and

228
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,400
it it took $20 for two weeks application

229
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,640
that's bad and I found Coach DB it is it

230
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,910
is an alt document database it's come

231
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,580
before MongoDB become well-known it's

232
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,350
but it comes with pots DB it's an

233
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,360
implementation of coach DB in JavaScript

234
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,020
client so the possible we could live in

235
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,470
your application where JavaScript it

236
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,510
with a little or a bit little size and

237
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,310
it it has approach sweet must multi

238
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,730
master nodes so actually that database

239
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,340
replication the database not only on the

240
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,950
cloud but your device is also a database

241
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,470
and it comes with a HTTP protocol for

242
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,070
replication so no need urine you don't

243
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,070
have to create another sing mechanism

244
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:28,170
because it was ready by the design okay

245
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,090
so what I'll tell you what do we choose

246
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,850
actually for all of ours of course we

247
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,670
need some requirement we need to web

248
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,870
development ready we need to mobile

249
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,490
development ready and time to implement

250
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,140
faster I don't put any economical

251
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,900
constraint here and I just caught the be

252
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,510
enforced to be with react why would

253
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,980
react yeah because I we were familiar

254
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,930
with react and react native that's way

255
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,070
and we can react react already

256
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,750
implemented surface rock already so you

257
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,520
just uncomment or sorry you just remove

258
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,390
two words the unregister change you to

259
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,030
register

260
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,280
that's we we gather offline first web

261
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,060
app

262
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,700
but it's not very simple development you

263
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,440
get who you have a lot of boilerplate

264
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,970
then you have to make a lot of

265
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,980
abstraction with the pots and pots DB

266
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,240
and we are coming with the another ideas

267
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,790
how do what if we create a reactive

268
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,980
rendering for pots and coats so your

269
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,740
your application cool render by

270
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,110
instantly yeah how do you interact with

271
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,570
in like a stack container what if we

272
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,860
create like a stack to endure to

273
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:56,400
interfacing odds with page century side

274
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,470
and this was classic approaching whereas

275
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,940
we have surfer we have component

276
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,720
renderer and this component state and if

277
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,650
we introduce offline first by using this

278
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:16,770
kind of thinking if we use redux we have

279
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,940
global stat Redux that that halt with

280
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,150
local storage that that interact with

281
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,750
surfer interact with component and if we

282
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,100
design with without Redux you only need

283
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,650
a local storage to store your data state

284
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,760
and if you remember this one from its

285
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,380
tremolo I think we're gonna use the

286
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,470
offline for sweet at radix because it's

287
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,720
much more similar with what other people

288
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,600
already had and we won't take another

289
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,350
step to reinvent the wheel

290
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,880
so we're creating that container

291
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,230
interfacing with data synchronization we

292
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,860
call it pot store it was in production

293
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,590
ready yet but we use it for our internal

294
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:13,230
tools and we have a story what gist or

295
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,330
example and it was a it is a to-do list

296
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,760
because nothing to trail in the world

297
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,430
that came with tout a to-do list simple

298
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,480
app ok this is how we initialize the

299
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,600
store which you just need to set your

300
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,010
URL remote

301
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,460
config and your authentication if it's a

302
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,380
label and this one is for the component

303
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:50,100
side you went to component mount you

304
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,510
have to subscribe the VIP I to render to

305
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,780
render your pets reactively and if you

306
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,600
want to add some item you just call the

307
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,110
add item API and for dello to you you

308
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,230
could just call the direct item so we

309
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,070
abstracted more of odd squad of pods

310
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,540
implementation to add end to the other

311
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:23,760
item and if you want to fetch the data

312
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,990
you could just call the dotted data it

313
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,630
contains your data and you can play with

314
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:37,500
it because this one this is our store

315
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,980
looks like in detail you have local deep

316
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,510
local DB ok remote DB and it will

317
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,310
replicate from and synchronous from

318
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,240
local and cloud vice versa and it will

319
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,540
it is what's your it was watching your

320
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,530
data changes so basically your your

321
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,090
application will read from the memory

322
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:08,220
not from the local storage and it comes

323
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,410
with crude IPA called mitosis really so

324
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,580
you don't have to create another

325
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:22,200
boilerplate few lines of code we are we

326
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,580
put in front for react different ring

327
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,110
but how about the relative support

328
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,780
because we we want to make what will

329
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,310
develop on radio also pots or pots

330
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,380
application I'm sorry what's libraries

331
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,160
use indexdb and it will fall back to web

332
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,000
a scale if there is an next DB what how

333
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,160
was recognized by whiskey l & SQ what's

334
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,800
use web SQL dragnet if can use SQLite

335
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,140
why not create an adapter for react

336
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:01,230
native for SQLite adapter and we stumble

337
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,990
upon Cordova SQLite stories and we we

338
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,940
just modified recognize post reg native

339
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,950
implementation by I think storage be

340
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,810
asking started to use the SQLite store

341
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,820
right why we asked you let storage

342
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,160
because it's much larger and much bigger

343
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,810
index DB can can hold about 50 to 60

344
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,030
megabytes I think I forgot the exact

345
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:33,630
number and SQLite do also okay so we got

346
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,310
a simple development often force web app

347
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:41,600
with reactive rendering and it's it is

348
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,290
thinking that online this one from web

349
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,920
and this one from mobile you can upload

350
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:57,180
it and if within goes offline you can

351
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:03,090
use your app as usual and with your

352
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,830
playing with the data and we can sing

353
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:12,930
directly after it has a connection so no

354
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,130
need to create another power of plaid

355
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,860
but we still have problem with a

356
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,000
processor limited about next connection

357
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,230
and we still have basic features need to

358
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,530
implement another slightly filtering and

359
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,970
my lesson was most conclusion is do not

360
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,120
create your own synchronism it's the

361
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,789
nightmare to creature

362
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:41,179
one thing mechanism and for other works

363
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:44,179
you have you could see the others like

364
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,979
Gandhi be looking for software by Martin

365
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:48,830
clip one you saw read what Martin click

366
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,649
on okay

367
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:54,769
I think the half of these tops I like

368
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:57,080
become a lecture because it was too

369
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,090
technical but III want to have a talk
