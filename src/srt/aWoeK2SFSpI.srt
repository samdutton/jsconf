1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,600
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,460
I hope you had a great lunch.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,059
So, let's get started.

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:21,380
This talk is about augment ing empathy, and
what I mean by that is basically that you

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,470
already have empathy, but there can be some
things or tools that you use actually to augment

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,890
that a little bit more, to understand some
situation s and to make things clear, and

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:39,480
we will be using CSS, SVG, and WebRTC to do
this.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,030
My name is she she.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:56,280
Basically, I do a lot of R&D to try to look
at new technologies.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:06,840
Previously, I used to work at Opera.

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,910
It's a company based in Mumbai, and it does
a lot of accessibility consulting, auditing,

12
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,910
and stuff like that.

13
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,730
It is also an enterprise with a social mission,
and part of that mission is providing opportunities

14
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,840
to people with disabilities, and so much so
that about 70 per cent of our staff are people

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,810
with disabilities.

16
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:38,490
One of the person in the staff is Ahmed who
was born with with low vision.

17
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,870
Back in 2005, he met with an accident, and
he lost sight in his right eye.

18
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,360
So, but that didn't stop him.

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,710
He still had an interest in tech, and he ended
up become a trainer and goes to a lot of different

20
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:57,850
conferences, trainings and workshops to teach
people how to make their site successful.

21
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,760
When I got to know him, and we got talking,
there were - I quickly realised there were

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,530
a lot of things which people who have low
vision were confused about, particularly with

23
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,759
his condition.

24
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,980
A lot of times, people couldn't understand
the way in which his vision worked or didn't

25
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,069
work.

26
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,370
We also had people who were low vision, and
I talked with them as well.

27
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,590
I talked to their colleagues, friends and
families, and caretakers as well.

28
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:37,530
One trend kept coming again and again which,
a lot of times, it was difficult for for people

29
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:45,599
with low vision really to articulate what
their condition was, how they basically saw

30
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,480
the work, and sometimes, people who didn't
have low vision couldn't understand what was

31
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
happening.

32
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,010
So I did a little bit more research.

33
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,520
I actually consulted an ophthalmologist as
well to get the medical perspective from someone

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,760
who has dealt with hundreds of thousands of
cases.

35
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,480
One thing was very, very clear: low vision
is a very generic term.

36
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,880
If you say, "Someone has low vision," with
a lot of times people assume it is a form

37
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,320
of myopia.

38
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,810
That can be the case.

39
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,220
That's not always the case.

40
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,200
Sometimes, you have glaucoma, macular degeneration
- all these things are there.

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,100
If you ask the random person on the street
what is macular degeneration, they might not

42
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,349
know.

43
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:40,780
One thing became clear, that one of the things
I could do is not help people with low vision

44
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,110
but actually help everyone else understand
what low vision is.

45
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,110
That's where the simulators come in.

46
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,870
I said, can we make something to simulate
what the vision is like?

47
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:58,569
And, if it is possible, can we use the web
to do this, and also gravy on top, if we can

48
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:05,590
use JavaScript less and SVG have CSS more,
that would be more awesome.

49
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:13,740
The first condition I chose was colour blindness,
and this is even more poignant here in Europe

50
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:20,139
because eight per cent of men and 0.5 of women
of northern European ancestry have some form

51
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:27,169
of red-green colour blindness, and the more
you talk to people who have red-green colour

52
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:32,129
blindness, the more you will see in the physical
world, not just in the online world but the

53
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:37,120
physical world, there's still a lot of stuff
in which you need to determine whether something

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,749
is red or green, right?

55
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:44,599
The most obvious example is traffic lights,
but that's not just the case.

56
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:51,819
If you have the MacBook charger, if you charge
it, and you want to look from afar whether

57
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:57,629
it is still charging, the only way to distinguish
it is whether it is red or green in colour.

58
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,659
That's it.

59
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:05,650
So I made a tool which you can actually simulate
the different conditions.

60
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,590
This is using WebRTC and applying SVG on top.

61
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,129
The reason why it is actually pretty useful
is because a lot of times, people get it wrong.

62
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:27,930
I asked a lot of people with normal 2020 vision,
what would it be like to live with colour

63
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,539
blindness and see something red in colour,
what would they see?

64
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:38,680
A lot of times, people become confused and
don't know and assume it will be a desaturated

65
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,300
version of that image.

66
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
That's not the case.

67
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,999
Over here, we can see that, in one condition,
you will have this bench as brown in colour.

68
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:51,460
On the other hand, you will have something
light greenish in colour.

69
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,349
The real colour is actually red.

70
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:57,599
How do we actually do this?

71
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:08,219
I use something called SVG colour matrix,
which is a set of matrix values that you provide.

72
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,440
It basically works like this.

73
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,050
You have an image.

74
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,580
Each and every image will have an RGBA value.

75
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,839
You have a matrix with a set of values over
here, and all you do is matrix-multiply the

76
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,159
values together to form a new colour for that
particular pixel.

77
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:31,469
You can define an SVG colour filter over here.

78
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:42,210
Then the colour matrix, and values, you can
write out all the values come are a-separated.

79
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:50,800
In the CSS, it is as simple as saying filter
URL, hashtag, whatever.

80
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,949
That's all very, very nice to know, right?

81
00:06:53,949 --> 00:07:00,760
But it's one thing to have an academic or
mathematical perspective of how SVG colour

82
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,270
matrix works, and the other is to have an
intuitive understanding.

83
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,020
The only thing that I've seen which grants
you that is experimentation, unfortunately.

84
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,240
You can't get it how it works, just by learning
a few things.

85
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,479
You need to experiment.

86
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:26,379
Fortunately, if you Google, the SVG playground,
where you can mix and match different values

87
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:31,530
and see what the output would be, and that
gives a better perspective and a more intuitive

88
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,530
understanding.

89
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:38,889
I will be sharing the slides later on as well
with links to some really, really nice articles

90
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:46,949
opinion let's take this opportunity to know
about the matrix and put it in our pocket.

91
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,379
We will revisit this later on.

92
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:56,991
Now that we have a tool which can address
different colour blindness conditions, one

93
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:02,389
of the things that I also - when talking with
people with red-green colour blindness - I

94
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:08,960
say how do you distinguish between red and
green and nothing else?

95
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,219
It's a bit difficult to do so.

96
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,930
I made something which, for lack of a better
name, I called the red-green sheet.

97
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:22,229
On the left, you have one example of the test
which is generally a set of tests which is

98
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,680
used for people to diagnose colour blindness.

99
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,159
If you don't have colour blindness, you will
see 74.

100
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,450
If you do have it, you will see something
like 21.

101
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:43,330
Over here, let me just go back, you can see
I've made something where you're basically

102
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,010
isolating things into two categories.

103
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,280
If something is red, it goes into the left
category.

104
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,800
If something is green, it goes into the other
category.

105
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:00,720
This is all done in real time, and it's done
using CSS and SVG.

106
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,430
The only JavaScript part is getting the camera
output.

107
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,840
So this is how we do it.

108
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,590
The first thing that we do is apply an SVG
filter, and the second thing we do is apply

109
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,730
a mixed blend mode of hue.

110
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,800
Simple, but it hides a lot of complexity behind
it.

111
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,610
Let's revisit this, see and go into a deeper
dive into what this means, and how this effect

112
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,210
is actually done.

113
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,070
To do that, let's go really, really back.

114
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:38,810
How many people watched Looney Toons when
they were a child?

115
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,680
Everyone.

116
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,430
All these cartoons use something called cell
animation - "cell" standing for celluloid

117
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:55,430
- and the reason why is these were transferring
sheets, and, generally speaking, in any kind

118
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:01,760
of animation, you had a bunch of characters
moving around, but you also had some background

119
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,610
which was static.

120
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,920
What you could do is basically have a sheet
where you just paint the background once and

121
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,500
be done with it, and all the other stuff you
can do with the character animations and put

122
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,140
one layer on top.

123
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,860
A lot of these animations were done like this
where the character animations were done by

124
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:27,150
one team, and the background animation or
painting was done by some other team in parallel,

125
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:32,020
and then the final result was putting those
layers on top of each other.

126
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,060
This was basically an early form of what we
call compositing.

127
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,740
Compositing and blending, the spec is based
off this, but come positing and blending has

128
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,860
been around for a long time, even as part
of SVG.

129
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,750
So what exactly is composting.

130
00:10:49,750 --> 00:11:02,720
It is it's how to deal with - ... 
what exactly is - it is named after Thomas

131
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:11,070
Duff who in 1984, they published a seminal
paper on how to deal with overlapping objects

132
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,660
- this exact thing called compositing.

133
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,940
At that time, they were in the early 1980s
working together on a small company called

134
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:26,390
Lucas Film which was doing a lot of pioneering
work when it came to digital graphics.

135
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:33,040
They basically said in that paper that, if
you have two layers, one on top of the other,

136
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,420
so the top layer is called a source layer,
the bottom layer is called a destination,

137
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
right?

138
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,740
So, in that overlapped portion, you can do
pretty much four things: first, none.

139
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,870
You don't show anything over there.

140
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,600
Second is the source in which you show the
top layer.

141
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,320
Third is the destination in which you show
the bottom layer, and the fourth, and more

142
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,410
interest interesting one, is show a combination
of both the top and bottom layer, right?

143
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,690
And this is where opacity and alpha channels
come in.

144
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,950
Coming back to our example, what we need to
do in the first half to recreate the effect

145
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:13,370
that we saw in the colour sheet is to somehow
make it black and white but own the red colour

146
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,370
showing.

147
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,820
So, in this case, what we do is, if you can
see the red-green and blue channels are all

148
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,500
zero, right?

149
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:30,110
In effect, what this matrix is doing is basically
taking this image and making everything transparent

150
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,370
except for the colours which have a little
bit of an R value.

151
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:44,070
Then we come posit it on the original image
to get some of the red stuff.

152
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:52,360
Value equals zero so it is totally desaturated.

153
00:12:52,360 --> 00:13:00,440
Then we composite them on top to get the black
and white image with just the red showing.

154
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,360
All of this using SVG, nothing else.

155
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,210
Now, the first part is complete.

156
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,880
The second thing we want to do is to understand
blending and how that works.

157
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,890
So blending is basically how to deal with
the overlapped portion in terms of colours,

158
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,250
and the mixing of the colours.

159
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,820
So, for example, we have this particular layer.

160
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,290
And then you have a layer on top of it over
here.

161
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,540
So, there's a portion which is overlapping,
right?

162
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,930
How do we deal with the colours over here?

163
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,750
That is the essence of blending.

164
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,350
In a more practical example, let's see this
image.

165
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:50,870
We can have a few layers, we can mix and match
them through whatever we want to achieve this

166
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,470
particular final layer.

167
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,290
This is essentially what blending is, mixing
and matching different layers, to achieve

168
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,630
a final effect.

169
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,910
Let's come back to an example.

170
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,780
Over and over here, we have a container div
which is red in colour.

171
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,620
Inside this, we have the video, which is running.

172
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,850
Right now, we haven't applied any effects,
so it's just the normal colours.

173
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,650
The moment we apply the SVG filter we talked
about, everything is grey scale apart from

174
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,660
the red stuff.

175
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,840
Then we will apply a blank board.

176
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,650
We're applying a hue.

177
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,360
This works in the cell space.

178
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,860
It will take the hue from the top layer and
combine it with the saturation and luminosity

179
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,750
of the bottom layer, so, in this case, all
the black and white stuff will be basically

180
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:48,240
a grey area, whereas the rest will be bright
red, so ultimately you get this.

181
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,160
So it's just two lines, but it hides a lot
of complexity, and it's very, very important

182
00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:00,420
to know the concept of layers and how it plays
into blending and compositing, and with JavaScript,

183
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,440
if you have a proper understanding of it.

184
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,230
One more thing that I worked on was macular
degeneration.

185
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:20,190
Sometimes, it's called age-related macular
degeneration.

186
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,720
If you have a visual, you can see what it
actually means.

187
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,510
It's sometimes also pretty tragic or heart-breaking,
because a lot of time, it affects people who

188
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:35,190
are older, and, by the time they have grandchildren,
and sometimes, they have a hard time seeing

189
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:41,250
the faces of their grandchildren, and that's
- and that's something which if someone else

190
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,590
comes in, that's something else which people
don't get, the human aspect of how it makes

191
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,060
people feel.

192
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:57,430
So anyways, like I was saying, if I have to
recreate this effect using SVG, or just CSS,

193
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,590
how do I do this?

194
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,351
Fortunately, in this case, I don't want to
use SVG.

195
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:07,950
I can use a radial gradient with a blend mode.

196
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:16,290
If you have a container detective which is
a radial gradient which is black to transparent,

197
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,580
and you combine it with the video output,
then you ply a mixed - apply a mixed blend

198
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,050
and multiply, and you get this kind of effect.

199
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,300
In most cases in web designs, you won't really
use this, but if you take the opposite of

200
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:38,400
it in which you have transparent to black
radial element and combine it with an image,

201
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,730
then apply the multiplier, then you can get
nice effects on images without using Photoshop,

202
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,390
which is really, really great.

203
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:53,960
One thing that I wanted is for you to put
it on top of your headsets.

204
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:00,420
Nowadays, our headsets are getting cheap,
and some of these allow these to use the background

205
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,000
to see on the other side.

206
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,819
Not all of them, but some allow you to do
that.

207
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,110
If you do, then you can actually do this.

208
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:15,409
You can have stereoscopic mode where you have
two video elements and you can go full screen

209
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:21,120
and use it as part of a VR to get a more immersive
experience.

210
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,240
If you want to do this, right, there are a
few things that you want to do.

211
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:33,249
First, you want to make sure that it displays
just one video on portrait mode and two videos

212
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:34,249
on landscape mode.

213
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:40,789
You have to detect whether something is in
portrait mode and hide the video.

214
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,860
So it - there is a lot of stuff going on over
here.

215
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,350
I also want to make sure that everything is
full screen so that you don't see the browser

216
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,720
and address bar, and once you're in that full-screen
mode, you don't want to switch between portrait

217
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,350
and landscape every time you're moving your
head, so you want to lock the orientation

218
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,700
as well.

219
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
This is how we do it.

220
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,340
You can have a full-screen API, the moment
something goes in full screen, we can use

221
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,140
the orientation lock API so that it doesn't
switch between portrait and landscape all

222
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,950
the time.

223
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,890
One more thing that I do is I use a CSS exclusively
for full screen as well, so, in this case,

224
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:24,769
I can use along with prefixes, the full screen
pseudo element.

225
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:28,309
This will just be applied on full screen.

226
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,659
One more thing that I do is of course have
custom CSS for the orientation.

227
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:37,549
If something is in portrait mode, it needs
a certain set of standards apply than in landscape

228
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,549
mode.

229
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:44,299
Here you have the media library for orientation
mode as well.

230
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:52,590
One thing people are not talking about but
shed is the fact that in PWAs, of you a lot

231
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,490
of display modes.

232
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,389
So you can load a PWA as a normal browser
tab, but once you install that PWA you can

233
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:04,270
open it up as a standalone app.

234
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:11,789
In that case, you don't have the browser address
bar which means you have increased screen

235
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:16,690
real estate that you need to account for and
do something with.

236
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:23,720
Hero, use the display mode standalone and
see what the display mode is, and, depending

237
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,350
upon that, you can have custom CSS.

238
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:34,580
One of the things that I've used, and one
last thing, that I leave you with is that

239
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,720
none of this actually matters.

240
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,929
It doesn't matter if you don't actually talk
with people and interact with people with

241
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,320
real disabilities.

242
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,870
That's really, really important.

243
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:50,350
I like this tweet, which was, retweet if you're
tabled and an inspiration.

244
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:56,119
If the person then stick around to get to
know you as a person.

245
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:01,059
It got 630 retweets by the time I screen shotted
this.

246
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,090
That's a big thing.

247
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,289
When you're talking about empathy, you really
need to kind of generate empathy somehow,

248
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:13,059
and the only way you can do it is actually
to be someone's friend, or be listening to

249
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:18,031
a person, not academically reading things
here and there, right?

250
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:20,539
That's one of the things about disability
simulators.

251
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:25,029
A lot of people think that, just because I
have interacted with a simulator, suddenly

252
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:28,750
I know everything about people with that particular
disability.

253
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,850
That's not true.

254
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,179
Human interaction is always always required.

255
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,960
A lot of times, people were able-bodied, they
put on a simulator, they struggle, and they

256
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,789
put it back down, and then they think everyone
with that disability is just struggling 24/7.

257
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,919
That's also wrong.

258
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,559
This is a tweet who says not every person
with a disability feels they are.

259
00:20:51,559 --> 00:21:03,639
The insinuation that disability is equal to
suffering ... so, when it comes to empathy,

260
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:09,740
one layer is yes, you need to think about
what other people are finding challenging,

261
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,110
what problems people are facing, but the other
side is actually to get to know what they

262
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:20,179
want to do, what their potential is, what
they aim for, what are their goals in life,

263
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,889
and then what are you going to do about it,
right?

264
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:29,980
These tools that I try to make, I always forms
the idea that, okay, now, actually do a task

265
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,350
five times, because, by the fifth time, they're
not struggling so much.

266
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,159
Then they realise that, okay, people who have
these conditions have developed coping mechanisms,

267
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,029
and actually, kind of gotten used to it, and
now they're taking dysfunction just like everyone

268
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:47,659
else.

269
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:55,190
So, being empathic it's recognising a few
things.

270
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,869
It's multilayered.

271
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:01,549
You need to recognise the challenges that
people face, right?

272
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:04,480
And it could be something as simple as just
believing someone when they say they have

273
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,519
a problem, right?

274
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:11,610
It doesn't even apply to people with disabilities
but every kind of marginalised group.

275
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,460
Listen and believe them when they say they
have a problem.

276
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,919
The second thing is recognising the strength
and potential that people have, right?

277
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,139
So, if a person really wants to do something,
have faith in them.

278
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:30,710
I can give you a story of a person who went
- who was diagnosed with low vision.

279
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:37,190
A lot of well-meaning well-wishers said take
up pottery or handicrafts or something like

280
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,190
that.

281
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,139
It was coming from a good place but it wasn't
the right advice.

282
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:46,899
That person wanted to go in tech and do stuff
with computers.

283
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:52,100
Fortunately, she joined our company and is
now one of the top people over there.

284
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,659
The main thing to recognise is that what other
people are supposed to be doing, what people

285
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:02,830
are capable of doing under supporting that.

286
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,840
And ultimately, the way in which you display
your empathy has to be a combination of all

287
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,840
these things, just like blend modes, like
you have different layers, and you kind of

288
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,860
like mix and match between different colours,
the same thing has to be happening with your

289
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,470
approach to empathy as well.

290
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:27,580
So, recognise the challenges they face; recognise
they are capable, they have potential; and

291
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,269
then ultimately your action as well, because
empathy without action is useless.

292
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,039
That's the thought that I will leave you with.

293
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,039
Thank you so much!
