00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,400

hi thank you so much for inviting me

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,310
here i am like pumped beyond words like

3
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,110
I can't even like I'm not even

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,490
caffeinated I'm just like yes so thank

5
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,800
you again my name is Raquel velas you

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,890
can find me on Twitter I'm rockbot and

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,770
it's like rocky and a robot that's me um

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,879
rockbot and i work at Storify I'm a

9
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,410
front-end engineer at Storify if you

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,080
wanted to learn more about social media

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,910
and journalism and all that stuff I'm

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,620
happy to talk about that or we could

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,470
talk about robots is there something

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,860
wrong good no oh okay it's let's get

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,659
started first of all it's so warning

16
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,989
there may be math they're actually there

17
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,990
will be math if any of you have an

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,880
allergic reaction to math the way that I

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,060
have an allergic reaction to space it's

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,610
okay just hold out like bear with me it

21
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,740
will get awesome I promise and there

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,140
will be a demo so yeah okay so a little

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,060
bit about me and I have been a

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,770
practicing roboticist for about 10 years

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,159
now and believe it or not before I went

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,039
into robotics I wanted to be a filmmaker

27
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,450
my whole goal in life was to be the next

28
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,549
Steven Spielberg and moved back to

29
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,740
California and went in Academy Award and

30
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,100
be just super awesome but then I was a

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,079
high school student and I got invited to

32
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,850
a society women engineers event in

33
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,619
Princeton University and there were

34
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:47,210
bunch of Engineers and there's this one

35
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,799
mechanical engineer who's like yeah

36
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,149
these engineers are all really awesome

37
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:52,399
whatever great but I built this in my

38
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,109
class and she whips out this robot and

39
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:56,590
puts it on a table and I was like oh oh

40
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,340
my god I I learned three things that day

41
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,929
first that it is possible to build

42
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:05,509
robots I didn't know that i thought that

43
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,219
robots were just figments of our

44
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,770
imagination that we saw in movies and on

45
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,260
TV and in write about in books and then

46
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,370
the second thing I learned was that

47
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,140
women could build robots because that

48
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,180
also didn't occur to me and then third

49
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,130
was that I already had the skill set

50
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,460
that I needed to get started uh and that

51
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,319
would just completely blew my brains and

52
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,950
I just was like okay that's it films

53
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,019
over robots all the

54
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,230
so I I made it my life goal to just

55
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,109
start building robots and my very first

56
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:41,590
robot I was in high school and I had a

57
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,269
lot of privilege but I got to build this

58
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:48,849
awesome guy his name is Adrian and he is

59
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,829
a search and rescue robot his job is to

60
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,920
follow this line and and find victims

61
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,920
made out of aluminum foil it was really

62
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,579
awesome it won a couple of wards at

63
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,290
different competitions internationally

64
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,480
so if you don't think that you can start

65
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,189
playing around with robots this is a

66
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,680
really good starter actually at the time

67
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,629
Lego Mindstorms if you help me people

68
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:16,450
apart of Lego Mindstorms excellent so at

69
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,359
the time and I was 17 18 years old at

70
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:22,090
that point and it turned out that the

71
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,099
average user of Lego Mindstorms was a 35

72
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:28,000
34 year-old male so like anybody can

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,349
just get started and start playing with

74
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,349
robots so that was high school and I

75
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,180
knew I had to be playing robots for

76
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,609
guests of my life so I went ahead and

77
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:40,389
just kept going I went to Cal Tech to

78
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,250
get my my mechanical engineering degree

79
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,639
and this was my second robot or rather

80
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,239
this was my second robot um this is Bob

81
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,659
this is a caltex first entry into the

82
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:55,569
darpa grand challenge at which if you've

83
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,949
never heard of that it's a race for

84
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:59,500
autonomous viet autonomous vehicles in

85
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,489
the desert so basically driverless cars

86
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,019
you've probably seen them before but

87
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,879
this was one of the first instances of

88
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,500
anybody ever actually doing that and

89
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,049
this was my second robot which is kind

90
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,340
of a huge jump between the two but

91
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,099
whatever it was awesome and I'd like to

92
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:19,419
note that the reason we had to use a

93
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:21,459
Chevy Tahoe is because the entire back

94
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,120
of this vehicle is full of computers

95
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,090
full of computers our iphones can

96
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,500
probably do about half of what that does

97
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,810
now but at the time it was my oh my god

98
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,590
okay so after like during and after

99
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,810
college there were some more robots and

100
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,850
at chris mentioned i worked at NASA JPL

101
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,419
I did some DoD stuff I did an internship

102
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:48,020
in Germany at doing a biomechanical

103
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,360
research using to KUKA robots which I'll

104
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,400
get into it in a second and another a

105
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,480
couple other robots that I can't really

106
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,660
talk about sir but if you want to talk

107
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,130
about any of those other robots just

108
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,900
come holler at me so basically I was in

109
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,169
this world of traditional robotics and I

110
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:09,919
learned a few things for example i

111
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,800
learned that robots come from research

112
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,430
it's this really really slow academic

113
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,800
process and robots are really hard

114
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,530
they're difficult it's it takes a lot of

115
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,870
effort you have to do need to write

116
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,160
these papers and you have to present

117
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,990
them and then you have to hope that

118
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,729
nobody else has presented anything like

119
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,410
it so that you can get the credit for it

120
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,169
up and then you also kind of need your

121
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,800
PhD because phd's do research research

122
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,040
costs a lot of money and they kind of

123
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,810
need and I put this in quotes because

124
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,229
i'm debating this but they need object

125
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,090
oriented and threading because of all

126
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,760
the vast vast amounts of sensor data

127
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,800
that's coming in so you know whatever

128
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,800
great I also learned that if you're

129
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,760
wondering about robot domination not

130
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,740
going to happen any time soon you're

131
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,080
more likely to get hit by a zombie

132
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,320
apocalypse than Skynet just so you know

133
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,300
if you want to know why I asked me about

134
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,690
it later or or come to the node BOTS

135
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,400
event tomorrow and you'll find out why

136
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,100
that's not happening anytime soon so

137
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,100
then I took a little bit of a break from

138
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,530
robotics I was getting a little tired of

139
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,380
being alone in a lab and it was cold and

140
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,180
this whole academic process was really

141
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,389
slow and yeah so I decided to do

142
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:37,520
something that kind of filled my instant

143
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,180
gratification thing and that was web

144
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,220
development I was like hey I can press

145
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,849
refresh and boom look I can see what's

146
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:48,169
there and that's awesome i don't have to

147
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,910
worry about

148
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,620
and then porting it over to the robot

149
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,890
and hoping and praying that that the

150
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,770
robot will still work after everything

151
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,120
that there doesn't isn't like magic

152
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,800
smoke or something I can just literally

153
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,920
press refresh and see what happens but

154
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,950
then then you know Here I am playing

155
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,230
around a node and having some fun and

156
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,680
then there's this this guy you may have

157
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,890
met him um who decided that he wanted to

158
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,330
start playing around with hardware and

159
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,040
node and I was like okay that's that's

160
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,640
cool you know no big deal and then there

161
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,800
was this other guy yeah who decided that

162
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,470
you know really robots hard word one

163
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,710
okay robots yeah okay cool and I saw his

164
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,500
at his his talk at node conf last year

165
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,710
and and it was really cute there was

166
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,170
this little robot and he was he was

167
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,150
running around a stage he's trying to

168
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,990
avoid these obstacles and I was like um

169
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,940
but then I said wait a second what if we

170
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,730
could do more what if we could make them

171
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:01,720
smarter what if we could do stuff so I

172
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,580
did um so I basically have created this

173
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,169
module call vector which I'll get into a

174
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,720
little bit more and the quick version of

175
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,690
it it is it's a linear algebra module

176
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,660
specifically for robotics just kind of

177
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,530
as a starter so let's put that further

178
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,050
ado let's get into it a little bit of

179
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,150
robotics 101 artificial intelligence

180
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,030
let's talk about what that means what is

181
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,580
artificial intelligence anyway and

182
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,520
really it's it's simple you're giving

183
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,320
something else the ability to make

184
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,270
decisions simple right so for example

185
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,030
let's say you have this you know

186
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,890
adorable little robot who's trying to

187
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,620
avoid obstacles you could you could

188
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,000
really program this with a simple if

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,600
else sort of thing right so if I'm

190
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,200
driving along and I see something and I

191
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,770
can't go through it then stop move back

192
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,980
turn a little bit and then

193
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,820
try again if I hit something you know or

194
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,490
I'm close to something stop move back

195
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,230
turn a little bit and then keep going

196
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,690
until I get through away from the

197
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,300
obstacles that's that is absolutely

198
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,889
artificial intelligence that's called

199
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:22,089
object or obstacle avoidance simple but

200
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,139
what if you need something a little bit

201
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:27,070
more complex so robotics 101 again

202
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,130
serial manipulators who's heard of a

203
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,550
serial manipulator okay I promise you

204
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,440
you probably have all actually seen with

205
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,910
serial manipulators you just didn't know

206
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,850
what they were called this is a cuca

207
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,970
robot it is a serial manipulator

208
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,490
basically it has a series of joints

209
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,040
connected by links this particular

210
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,519
cooker robot is writing a version of the

211
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,680
Martin Luther Bible why I don't know

212
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,750
does it matter not really I would like

213
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,579
to note that cuca is a German company

214
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:05,440
and maybe that has something to do with

215
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,310
Martin Luther I don't know anyway so

216
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,339
great so let's kind of now okay guys the

217
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:14,829
math is going to start just brace

218
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:21,519
yourselves um so want to come okay so

219
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,740
this is a serial manipulator once again

220
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,470
you may have seen these in building cars

221
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,690
how many have seen those those big

222
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,139
robots that kind of piece cars together

223
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,670
yeah exactly that's a serial manipulator

224
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,000
that's all it is and okay so the whole

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,430
point of this is like I said there are a

226
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,360
series of joints and they're connected

227
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,600
by links and you have some sort of base

228
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,779
and you have some sort of claw we're

229
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:51,310
gonna call it the end effector because

230
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,170
that's more scientific sounding we're

231
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,310
going to call it the claw that just

232
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,800
called the claw okay so we have a claw

233
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,010
and we have a basin and each we have a

234
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,269
couple of joints and and and the way we

235
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:06,040
represent this mathematically as we look

236
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,620
at frames of reference and so each joint

237
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,220
by convention has a frame of reference

238
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,500
so I'm going to use my arm because

239
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,570
that's also a classic serial manipulator

240
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:22,570
um so we have a shoulder joint right and

241
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,360
we have an elbow joint like this and

242
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,780
then we have like a claw right and and

243
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,560
so there are two major pieces of zero

244
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,510
manipulators in terms of mathematically

245
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,940
doing fun stuff with them so there's

246
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,530
forward kinematics in the way that

247
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,660
forward kinematics works is we have a

248
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,000
bunch of inputs that are angles and then

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,760
out we get a position so what does that

250
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,430
look like each of these joints are

251
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,350
angles right so got my shoulder angle

252
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,780
and I've got my elbow angle and then i

253
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,210
have the position of my claw right so

254
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,710
basically forward kinematics says if I

255
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,460
put in a bunch of angles I will get out

256
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,220
a position does that make sense cool all

257
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,220
right so then that actually has a single

258
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,020
solution makes sense right there's only

259
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,720
two inputs I'm always gonna get the same

260
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,730
I'm going to get an output no matter

261
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,760
what inputs I put in its going to be

262
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,560
static then there's inverse kinematics

263
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,860
which should be pretty self-explanatory

264
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,720
basically we know the position of our

265
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,800
claw and then what are the angles of our

266
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,050
joints this is a harder problem to solve

267
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,180
because if for example i have my claw

268
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,670
here well I could have my joints in this

269
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,920
configuration or I could have it in this

270
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,440
configuration right so it's a little bit

271
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,710
more difficult but for right now we're

272
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,930
not going to worry about that just

273
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,160
understand forward kinematics inverse

274
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,170
kinematics make sense cool all right now

275
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,950
it's going to get a little bit more

276
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,390
Matthew sorry guys so the way that we do

277
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,210
this representation is stuff is we use

278
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,090
matrices matrices are your friend

279
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,790
especially in robotics they're awesome I

280
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,090
love them if they scare you we will we

281
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,740
will clean out the spiderwebs and it's

282
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,620
going to be fine it's going to be okay

283
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,550
but the whole point of this this is

284
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,950
specifically a homogeneous matrix and

285
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,260
the way that it works is we have two

286
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,180
major components to it we have a

287
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,160
rotational component and a position

288
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,779
component and so for each frame

289
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,339
frame has a homogeneous matrix

290
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:34,160
associated with it okay so for every

291
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,379
single joint think about it every single

292
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:38,329
joint has rotation information and

293
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:40,459
position information so if i change the

294
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,819
angle of my shoulder the position and

295
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:46,040
the position of my elbow is going to

296
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,649
change right and then similarly if i

297
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:51,170
change the angle of my elbow then the

298
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,519
position of my claw is going to change

299
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,069
so you can basically come up with all

300
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:56,709
this information and now we have a

301
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:01,279
manipulator cool yeah I need head Bob's

302
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,720
or else I'm just going to be like mmm

303
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
okay so now how do we connect them all

304
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,529
together and it's just some simple

305
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,410
training so we have frames for each of

306
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,300
our joints we chain them together and we

307
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,709
get all of our information that we need

308
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:19,540
to go from beginning to end cool right

309
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,759
yeah all right I'm gonna pretend you

310
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,689
thought that was awesome too okay so now

311
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:28,550
comes vector we're going to let the

312
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,620
computer do all the hard stuff so we're

313
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,059
gonna let vector do all of the matrix

314
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:36,620
math we don't have to worry about I'm

315
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,209
not you don't have to worry about how to

316
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,519
multiply matrices together or how to

317
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,120
extract position information or how to

318
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,230
define rotational information or

319
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,639
anything like that we're just gonna let

320
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,750
back to do it and I should also note

321
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,750
that vector is literally just a linear

322
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,120
algebra module I'm using it for the

323
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,029
particular case of a manipulator but you

324
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,110
could also use it for things like

325
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,319
computer vision or a game engine

326
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,569
graphics or a whole bunch of other

327
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,959
really awesome things swarm robots all

328
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,970
that stuff it can all be used using

329
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,019
vector okay so like I said forward

330
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,679
kinematics with vector so we have our

331
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,639
our crazy matrix but now with some code

332
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,740
right you could just got you have your

333
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,120
homogeneous matrix you've got your

334
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,329
vector the irritations and then you have

335
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:28,519
your whole bunch of frames and so what

336
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,110
we're doing is we're just defining each

337
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,949
frame as having some rotation and some

338
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:36,620
position and then we're multiplying it

339
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,170
again each frame to the one before it

340
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,680
and then at the end we have some

341
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,089
at the end and this is just forward

342
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:45,529
kinematics I won't go into inverse

343
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:51,310
kinematics cuz yeah so are we good yeah

344
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,620
give me something come on all right

345
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,880
thank you ok I should note vectors not

346
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,010
perfect I know that that's why it's open

347
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:06,470
source help all right so demo time if

348
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,510
this doesn't work it's going to be ok

349
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,940
because i have a video but let's see

350
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,010
hopefully you can see this so we're

351
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,750
using facetime uh yeah and we're going

352
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:26,029
to turn this on and ok please wake up

353
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:33,560
yes move the console dang it oh we're

354
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,120
okay we're okay we're okay we're good No

355
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,300
ah this is what happens you shouldn't

356
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:49,800
said anything uh ok has

357
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:57,029
that did it wait yes alright cool can

358
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,649
everybody see this or some version

359
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,930
thereof can you see the little Johnny 5

360
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,050
okay so like I said you have the first

361
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,270
joint which is like your shoulder and

362
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,679
what we can do is we can kind of turn it

363
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:14,280
around like that yeah and then we have

364
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,689
our second joint and we can very

365
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:20,130
carefully do that and so that's forward

366
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,110
kinematics all I've done is just I've

367
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,069
put in the input of angles for each

368
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,800
joint and I can see on the screen where

369
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,679
the end effector / claw is obviously I

370
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,610
don't have a claw on here it's just

371
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,920
little Johnny Five sticker I'll let you

372
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,940
guys do the imagination stuff ok so yes

373
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,100
we've got this now inverse kinematics is

374
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,190
a little bit more interesting right so i

375
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,720
can just kind of grab the end and i'm

376
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,840
calculating mathematically what the

377
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,919
angles should be and so it doesn't even

378
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
have to be I could you know drag it to

379
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,630
the end here and then kind of come back

380
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:08,070
and it's doing a little dance the video

381
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,740
broke you see it all right well anyway

382
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:21,720
that's our demo thank you

383
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,630
and I have another video just in case my

384
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,720
backup or my extra backup or my hardware

385
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,610
my backup hardware didn't work but

386
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,240
anyway see how that was cute right um so

387
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,810
what so what indeed uh wait hon I have

388
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,900
to fix something I'm gonna turn that off

389
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,800
okay try it again okay hope you for

390
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,490
tweeting about me and it's so cute okay

391
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,940
so right so great um except you probably

392
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,520
some of you may have rumbas at home some

393
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,320
of you may have heard about those

394
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,390
military drones so you will be playing

395
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,240
with node copter tomorrow so you may

396
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,250
have heard of asimo the honda robot that

397
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:08,890
can like climb stairs and run great that

398
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,600
stuff's been solved this is this is

399
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,180
boring by comparison so why even bother

400
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,660
right why bother with JavaScript robots

401
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,650
and so yeah fair enough at this point in

402
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,210
time I wanted I really desperately

403
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,700
wanted to kind of prove that node was

404
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,910
better than C++ and Python either it's

405
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,860
not or I didn't have enough time I'm not

406
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,470
really sure but we'll leave that

407
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,140
question for another day the fact of the

408
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,480
matter is the traditional robotics

409
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,530
industry is kind of done already right

410
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,370
like I mean like it's ready it's

411
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,470
well-established it has tapped tools and

412
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,970
funding the smartest people in the world

413
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,730
are working there great and and us in

414
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,830
our little our little JavaScript node

415
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,350
BOTS we were we're just getting started

416
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,710
um it it fortunately doesn't cost that

417
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,810
much money this whole setup probably

418
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,170
cost me like 50 bucks but you know it's

419
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,580
a couple of pennies I don't have 50

420
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,400
million dollars although if anybody has

421
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,910
50 million dollars i will take it um and

422
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,520
and it's just it's just us right it's

423
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,080
just us we don't have PhDs but we know

424
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,360
JavaScript and I don't know how many of

425
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,270
you know python or C++ or any of the

426
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,740
other multiple languages that you could

427
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,650
be using but we all know JavaScript so

428
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,490
let's let's let's reframe this right so

429
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,790
in traditional robotics there's research

430
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,290
and papers and

431
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,340
caught the reason they have so much

432
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,250
money because it costs so much money

433
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,740
again compile load boot hope pray magic

434
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,610
smoke Oh God and you have to get a PhD

435
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,770
where is in JavaScript community right

436
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,530
in our little j/s community everything's

437
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,310
open source forget papers forget you

438
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,170
know research and top-notch labs etc

439
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,260
I've just put vector out there you can

440
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,660
go ahead and use it go ahead and fix it

441
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,760
make it better that's what we can do and

442
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,720
and you know you just refresh the page

443
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,700
any time things don't work just request

444
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,040
refresh the server breaks because you

445
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,500
overturned it oops buy another one for

446
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,230
twenty bucks it's not a big deal and you

447
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,070
don't need to get a few cheat you can

448
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,480
just get started just get started plus I

449
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,880
feel like with our powers combined

450
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,310
without the the the the obstacles of

451
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,130
getting a PhD or having to find millions

452
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,300
of dollars from the federal government

453
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,240
or whatever yadda yadda yadda we might

454
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,240
actually be able to use a new tool to

455
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,520
solve complex problems that have been

456
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,370
complex forever sensor fusion is a

457
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,960
really really difficult problem that's

458
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,660
the idea of having multiple sensors with

459
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,370
all these streams of data and then

460
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,750
trying to parse that into something that

461
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,510
makes some intelligible sense we're kind

462
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,940
of doing that with big data right why

463
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,170
don't we just kind of bring that over to

464
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,360
robotics what if we could solve that

465
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,780
problem better than the academics can ma

466
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:12,210
I no sirree okay but yeah why not so go

467
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,700
build a robot and then tell me all about

468
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,470
it because I really really want to know

469
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,930
what you guys come up with thank you

470
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:34,830
very much
