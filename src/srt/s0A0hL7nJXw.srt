10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,250
hello hello hello

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,079
jus thank you for having us welcome to

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,719
the last talk of Jay s comp us very

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,300
exciting one of two things has happened

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,070
either we've saved the best for last or

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,460
they've pushed all the crap to the end

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,050
we're not really sure which but I think

17
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,450
we're about to find out but let's be

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,430
honest yeah I don't want to do this you

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,050
don't want to know this do ya let's not

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,489
do this we'll just go straight to the

21
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:02,710
party you don't want to do this come on

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,630
just get in the hot tub yeah who cares

23
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,729
yes so welcome to datura what is this

24
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,530
car discovering the true identity of

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,760
horse Jay s using machine learning I'm

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,400
Burke and this is Jasmine Jasmine we're

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,229
gonna pass this shirt and forth here

28
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:25,270
yeah so we we work at Microsoft we work

29
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,850
on the azure team and one of the things

30
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,500
actually you know before we start you

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
want to just tell about a little bit

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,210
thing a little bit about yourself Burke

33
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,840
specifically your shirt

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,330
oh sure so I have a show called five

35
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,369
things that we do anybody here seen the

36
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,159
show five things a couple right so a

37
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,689
couple of I think I work with most of

38
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,729
these folks thank you for being here we

39
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,220
have literally dozens of viewers it's

40
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,320
the hottest show on YouTube we have at

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,240
least two comments across 17 videos so

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,350
yeah that's me I'm from Nashville

43
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,140
Tennessee so on behalf of all the web

44
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,299
developers in Nashville thank you for

45
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,590
having me yeah yeah and as I mentioned

46
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,960
before I'm I'm from New York

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,750
I'm from New York but I lived in Florida

48
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,549
so I was really excited to come hang out

49
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,099
at James calm 2015 when that happened

50
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,129
and I just recently learned that I'm

51
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:18,730
emceeing

52
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,739
and purchase so this was like we held in

53
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,280
New York City so I'm excited yeah so we

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
like I said mentioned before we're gonna

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,420
add your team at Microsoft and one of

56
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,239
the things that our team does for

57
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,160
training is we have these these boot

58
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,860
camps a lot of us have backgrounds that

59
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,739
are not in Azure or sometimes not even

60
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:41,830
in with cloud technology so it's just a

61
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,590
great time for us to get to learn about

62
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,510
the platform learn about the cloud and

63
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,480
also a chance for us our team to get to

64
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,060
meet each other in real life because we

65
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,470
are a globally distributed and remote

66
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,239
team so we don't get to see each other

67
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,230
in person at all are often so this is

68
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,480
pretty much where the story starts right

69
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,680
Burke yeah absolutely

70
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,239
so Jasmine makes a gift when we're

71
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,069
actually not on the same team or in the

72
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,290
in the same organization but Microsoft

73
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,670
is sort of a large company so when we

74
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,739
say organization we mean like a small

75
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,140
country and so we work on different

76
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,040
teams inside of the same organization we

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,920
were at this boot camp and this idea

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,069
like most great ideas was born of pure

79
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,670
boredom so we were in this class on

80
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,510
artificial intelligence and machine

81
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,910
learning and it was a real deep dive

82
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,850
into actually building models we'd been

83
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,549
there for two days this is day two we're

84
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:40,690
sitting in the back we're highly

85
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,190
caffeinated we'd be eating Google

86
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,750
clusters all day if you don't know what

87
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,459
that is see me later I'll explain to you

88
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,910
the glory of a Google cluster and and we

89
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,310
stopped paying attention as one does at

90
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,060
the end of two days of workshop actually

91
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,290
I stopped paying attention to about

92
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,989
10:00 a.m. on day one that's that's a

93
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,040
problem I should probably get some

94
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,269
medicine for that I'm gonna look into

95
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:02,859
that but we're sitting there talking

96
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:06,780
about machine learning and and we said

97
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,150
what if we could use this great power to

98
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,870
do some real good things like

99
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,620
discovering the true identity of the

100
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,320
horse j/s twitter account and so we had

101
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,970
this idea that we could take a bunch of

102
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,800
data and we could just stick it up in

103
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,990
the cloud and then like we could just

104
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,900
say like Alexa who is horse j/s and it

105
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,310
would just tell us because that's how

106
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,300
machine learning works

107
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,889
of coure

108
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,400
everybody knows that and so that's how

109
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,550
the idea came about but who what is

110
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,629
force chance for those who don't know

111
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:42,389
Jasmine yeah sure you did you want

112
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,580
explaining worse chances oh yes you're

113
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,800
absolutely can obviously we prepared

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,300
we've rehearsed this many times we have

115
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,150
it down to a science so horse genius is

116
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,219
a parody account on Twitter and what it

117
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:56,610
does is it takes fragments of other

118
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:04,310
people's tweets

119
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,880
and it and it tweets them out and of

120
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,530
course there's no context it's taken

121
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,330
completely out of context and so when

122
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,960
you see the horse Janice tweet right

123
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,610
like that's great and a lot of times

124
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,890
it's almost poetic right you're like oh

125
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,960
that's exactly how I was feeling right

126
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,170
now so it's this it's this weird

127
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,870
it's this weird sort of effect and it

128
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,520
actually comes from a viral account

129
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,830
called horse ebooks if you're familiar

130
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,020
with that which was started by a fellow

131
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,820
in Russia who later actually sold that

132
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,380
Twitter account to someone it got so

133
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,830
popular and so we really we've been

134
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,970
following this account both of us have

135
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,520
but we really enjoy this right I guess I

136
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,160
get a lot of joy out of what his horse

137
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,360
Jay is gonna say next

138
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,410
nobody knows right and so from that was

139
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,440
born the project which we called project

140
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,520
horse yeah so so naming and anything's

141
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,000
is hard

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,350
Namie piece is hard right so so we're

143
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,870
gonna talk a little bit about the the

144
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,620
story of how we we went through the the

145
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,080
process of with process horse our

146
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,360
projects our excuse me project horse so

147
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,100
first thing we did is we gather some

148
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,890
questions other than just who is horse

149
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,570
genius we had some additional questions

150
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,940
to kind of give us some clues as to as

151
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,220
to who it might be and to get to give us

152
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,190
a end result and then we from those

153
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,540
questions we started drawing some

154
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,010
assumptions some things that we already

155
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,170
knew about like twitter users and you

156
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,090
know the tech Twitterverse are the

157
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,910
JavaScript Twitterverse and the people

158
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,220
we knew and so from that we had some

159
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,200
assumptions and then finally we moved on

160
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,880
to planning trying to figure out what

161
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,650
technology we should use trying to

162
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,720
figure out what our what our end goal

163
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,750
was and trying to figure out how to even

164
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,560
get started

165
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,260
and then then we went we're going to

166
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,820
talk about how we pretty much built

167
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,030
built project course and then finally

168
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,880
we'll talk about the results and we'll

169
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,640
talk about and and we'll expose to you

170
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,480
exactly who horse races now I know I've

171
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,550
heard I've heard that people have been

172
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,320
saying if they don't say who course Jas

173
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,849
is

174
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,259
I'm gonna I'm gonna freak out they

175
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:16,939
better not say something like oh we're

176
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,139
all horseshoe yes

177
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,719
oh yeah I see you're laughing because

178
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,580
you said it we know you said it yeah

179
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,830
exactly and when that I mean that's kind

180
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,479
of a given right we are hurt we all owe

181
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,819
hurt yes you know horse jss content is

182
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,009
you know pretty much it's it's us you

183
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,599
know and like when you saw that tweet

184
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,399
you you you Chuck a little because you

185
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,259
can identify with that you know that

186
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,149
whole I think therefore I am right thing

187
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,610
right you know but let's but before we

188
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,679
even get into the results we don't want

189
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,819
we want to make sure that we don't put

190
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,229
the cart before the horse

191
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:51,459
ah thanks welcome that's free that was

192
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,349
so uh so first thing so first we're

193
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,519
going to look at the questions that we

194
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,379
had so the first question that we

195
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,899
thought of had is we want to figure out

196
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:01,909
was horse Jess more than one person I

197
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:04,490
initially I thought the horse Jess might

198
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,129
have been a bot and so at first I was

199
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,419
like should we even do this maybe it's

200
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,219
just about maybe we just move on maybe

201
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:13,639
there's nothing here and then we and

202
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,559
then you know also again horse jess has

203
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:18,769
has had has been has been around since

204
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:22,879
2012 I believe and has over 7,000 tweets

205
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,939
so we were like that's that's a lot of

206
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,740
that's a lot of content to keep up with

207
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,689
it can it can really be just one person

208
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,399
so other question we had was what tweets

209
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,060
just horse

210
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,000
Jess react to what makes horse GS want

211
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,130
to quote your tweet what what what do

212
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,779
you have to say to make horse Jess other

213
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,849
than the word JavaScript right to have

214
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,740
horse jeaious react to your tweet or

215
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,079
quote your tweet we also wanted to know

216
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,240
when horse Jess was the most most active

217
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,709
because that could be some some clues

218
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:51,560
that expose expose who this person might

219
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,259
be and then also we want to know if

220
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:55,910
there are certain accounts that horse

221
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,899
just like to react to and figure out if

222
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,209
that if that could kind of give us some

223
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,610
clues as to if they're followers or if

224
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,810
they are actually following horse neighs

225
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,360
yes and then finally we want to make

226
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,889
sure we want to check in horses ever

227
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:12,439
slipped up and maintaining their

228
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:15,399
anonymity because for any grid and crime

229
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,490
there are an average of 20 mistakes made

230
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,380
that point directly to the perpetrator

231
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,910
so we're hoping that we'd find something

232
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,589
good in that data set that's actually a

233
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:25,760
true fact if you're thinking of

234
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,889
committing a crime just

235
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:29,230
no statistically speaking there are 20

236
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,639
things that you will forget about that

237
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,279
will point directly to you and you will

238
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,290
be caught thusly so that's what you're

239
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,480
hoping for right exactly so from those

240
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,369
questions then we started to think about

241
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:40,869
our assumptions and you want to talk a

242
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:44,259
little bit about that sure so we had to

243
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,819
go into this whole thing with a certain

244
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,679
amount of assumptions you have to start

245
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,319
from somewhere so you know after sort of

246
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:52,660
the question phase here we moved into

247
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,759
forming some solid assumptions off of

248
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,290
which we could sort of move forward and

249
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,689
actually do something here you know what

250
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:00,249
we're what we're doing here is is very

251
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,889
much sort of a forensic analysis which

252
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:05,439
is why it gets very interesting so the

253
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,660
assumptions that we had here the first

254
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,059
one is that that horse is an actual

255
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,279
Twitter user ok whoever is behind horse

256
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,699
is also an active Twitter user it is not

257
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,399
a bot if it were a bot it would be very

258
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,029
hard to catch because it does not exist

259
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:23,709
and so we started with this assumption

260
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:26,259
that that was the case we didn't know

261
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,359
that but we had to assume that to move

262
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:31,149
forward the second thing that we assumed

263
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,179
is that horse Janus is a web developer a

264
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:36,660
JavaScript developer a node developer

265
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,730
they are not someone who is outside the

266
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,199
industry right it's not a real estate

267
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:43,209
agent who works all day selling houses

268
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,889
and then meet in the you know on the

269
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,509
side is tweeting out things about

270
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:48,160
JavaScript if you are a real estate

271
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,860
agent and you're here welcome we're glad

272
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,399
you're here

273
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,470
but we just figured that was not you so

274
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,079
that was assumption that we made there

275
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:59,249
about horse Jay is important another one

276
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:03,999
that we made is that the person behind

277
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:07,389
horse jeaious is probably following

278
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,509
horse jeaious have you ever heard this

279
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:14,529
one the person who commits the crime

280
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,769
often returns to the scene of the crime

281
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:20,649
were you heard that before there's a lot

282
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,129
of crime analogies in here that's very

283
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,759
true and we figured that whoever horse

284
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,289
Jay s is they probably cannot help but

285
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:35,049
seeing themselves in their own timeline

286
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:38,460
and chuckling

287
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,140
at the cleverness of what they have just

288
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,530
birthed to the world and so we assume

289
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,570
that they are they're following that

290
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,400
account because they just can't help

291
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,860
themselves

292
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,030
sort of developing a psychological

293
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,550
profile here the other assumption we

294
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,080
made is that horse jeaious is a single

295
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,000
person now I don't mean like horse

296
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,980
jeaious doesn't date I mean like it's

297
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,660
just one I want to clarify that first I

298
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,280
don't think that has anything to do with

299
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,910
horse yes

300
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,240
if horse jas is more than one person and

301
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,460
actually I should clarify here we

302
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,780
actually operated under different

303
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,180
assumptions here you were you were

304
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,560
pretty sure that it was more than one

305
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,180
person and I was pretty sure there was

306
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,880
only one person part of the reason why I

307
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,400
was sure of that is because I wanted

308
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,580
that to be the case this is how I this

309
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,140
on my life works how I engage with

310
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,950
reality and so if you think about it if

311
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,700
horse j/s is one person that makes it a

312
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,620
relatively straightforward task in terms

313
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,690
of trying to find who it is if it's more

314
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,690
than one person now your analysis has an

315
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,660
exponent on it and the logic tree has a

316
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,670
ton more branches in it and there's a

317
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,110
ton more things that you have to chase

318
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,600
down so actually finding one person

319
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,750
would be much much much easier than

320
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,780
trying to find multiple people trying to

321
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,800
solve crimes where there's multiple

322
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,660
perpetrators involved as incredibly

323
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,290
difficult to do another something that

324
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,850
we made is that horse jeaious is not

325
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,680
using a private list and this is another

326
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,410
one where we sort of disagreed kind of

327
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,120
threw out Jasmine thought that they were

328
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,280
I didn't know what a private list was

329
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,720
because I don't know how to use Twitter

330
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,020
apparently but apparently you can have a

331
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,030
list of people that you follow that

332
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,030
other people can't see and so if you go

333
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,230
to the horse Janus Twitter account

334
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,880
they're not following anyone they're

335
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,900
following an account called horse

336
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,260
context that is in tweeted in years and

337
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,840
so you know I assumed that that account

338
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,970
wasn't following anyone specifically but

339
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,580
that whoever was behind horse j/s what

340
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,160
was happening was there there on the

341
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,870
internet they on Twitter they're like

342
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,910
hahaha and then they turn over to this

343
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,630
other account

344
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,950
the horse count and then they tweeted

345
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,440
out that was the assumption and then the

346
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,970
last assumption we made the most

347
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,710
important one is that machine learning

348
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,900
is the answer to everything it's it's

349
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,130
like SharePoint it solves all your

350
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,090
problems hey can we cut that joke out of

351
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,560
the video now I'm just kidding leave it

352
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,340
in and so again we're JavaScript

353
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,960
developers we don't know anything about

354
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,890
machine learning

355
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,080
we're not data scientists right we're

356
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,000
just we're just trying to use it because

357
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,560
everybody's talking about it and they

358
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,970
won't shut up about it so here we are

359
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,030
let's let's make it work can it solve

360
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,530
this problem so there's really

361
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,140
assumptions that we made and then the

362
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,820
most in question that we important

363
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,960
question that we had to ask at this

364
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,260
point was how in the world are we gonna

365
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,870
do this we used to have these calls when

366
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,930
we were first starting out where we

367
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,130
would just sit there and talk for like

368
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,630
30 minutes to an hour and at the end of

369
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,400
the discussion we just had nothing right

370
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,960
under the bit like we didn't know what

371
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,700
conferences that we were going to and

372
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,350
like you know how our summer is going

373
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,390
but we didn't really bother than that

374
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,450
and and so and I was starting to get

375
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,160
really really worried because after the

376
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,660
day after we had submitted the abstract

377
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,850
you know we we submit the abstract to

378
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,740
J's comp us they said hey

379
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,060
congratulations

380
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,790
and I called jasmine I said oh crap I

381
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,340
got some bad news I was hoping for an A

382
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:17,369
but they said yeah because

383
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:20,209
so we had to get started and we did not

384
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:21,110
know how to get started this was

385
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,639
actually the hardest part of the whole

386
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,059
project fortunately there's this guy

387
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:33,769
this this is Vadim this is actually dr.

388
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,489
Vadim Vadim works on the azure team and

389
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:39,709
he has a PhD in computational biophysics

390
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,519
I have a Bachelors of Science in

391
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,339
Business Administration Vadim is

392
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,179
slightly more qualified than me to solve

393
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:57,439
this problem so when we sat down and we

394
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,519
met with Vadim I explained to him what

395
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,160
we were trying to do and he said okay

396
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,739
and what is your data set and I said

397
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:11,600
it's Twitter all of Twitter is the data

398
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,730
set it was like ooh and then he told me

399
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,980
something that was that completely sort

400
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,720
of changed the trajectory of this

401
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,369
project and what he said was you don't

402
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:28,040
have a machine learning problem you have

403
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,999
a statistics problem now what I didn't

404
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,679
understand about machine learning is

405
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,329
that what machine learning does is it

406
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,759
takes statistical models that you've

407
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,279
already created and it crunches those

408
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,379
models to then make predictions about

409
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,809
what might happen in the future so for

410
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,519
instance you could take all of the data

411
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,920
about horse j/s all the times that it's

412
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,869
tweeted and then what machine learning

413
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:53,660
can do is tell you based on this pattern

414
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,999
it's probably going to tweet again at

415
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,429
this time what machine learning is not

416
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,160
going to do is create the model for you

417
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,499
and give you the answer that just does

418
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:07,069
not work and so what we had to do here

419
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,610
was was really not about machine

420
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,010
learning as much as it was about data

421
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,279
and data science there is another person

422
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,220
who works at Microsoft I actually don't

423
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,569
know where this guy works this is Matt

424
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,730
Veloso I'm not sure where he is in the

425
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,559
organization but he tweeted this and I

426
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,460
was like oh

427
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,600
if you take one thing from this

428
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:41,840
presentation so so the next time

429
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,520
somebody at your company goes we need

430
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,680
machine learning like what maybe you

431
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,140
don't you might just need a regular old

432
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,020
query tell them to it hold your horses

433
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:57,770
you just might need a query oh I wish I

434
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,150
could say that was the last one but it's

435
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,240
probably not oh all right

436
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,410
so this is this is a really important

437
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,150
fact and one thing that I I think that

438
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,900
you're gonna take away from this

439
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,060
presentation is that machine learning is

440
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,920
very powerful it's very interesting it's

441
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,300
a very remarkable technology but it you

442
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,760
plug it in when you need it and I think

443
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,530
the thing that we all struggle with is

444
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,470
when do I need it and the answer is I

445
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,440
don't know but as we walk through this

446
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,330
presentation we're gonna get to a point

447
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,160
where we actually do use some machine

448
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,780
learning and you'll see that it's just

449
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,080
one piece of the puzzle ok so a lot of

450
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,700
the things that you can do you still do

451
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,170
those things but there's gonna be that

452
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,630
one thing where you're like I can't we

453
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,280
would need an army of people to do this

454
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,440
and it's one thing and that's where you

455
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,780
plug machine learning in that that's the

456
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,580
hole that it fills so with that we were

457
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,090
ready to get started yes what do we do

458
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,570
well first thing we wanted to do was

459
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,480
grab all these tweets and put them in a

460
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,390
datastore no the challenge was was

461
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,390
trying to figure out how how far back we

462
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,400
wanted to go on how how much or how much

463
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,720
tweets how many tweets did you want to

464
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,470
collect so to help us with this we use

465
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,810
this account called horse-playing j/s

466
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,990
thanks thanks to Trisha wherever you are

467
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,020
thank you for for informing us about

468
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,250
this and this account this room was

469
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,800
really helpful because what horse Blaine

470
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,100
does is for every horse j/s tweet horse

471
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,860
plane comes in and mentions the purse

472
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,260
the the originator tweet and then quotes

473
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,330
the the actual tweet that they they

474
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,670
posted yes thank you very much was it

475
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,490
Patricia you said yeah

476
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,730
thank you and horse thank you yeah horse

477
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,740
plane has ratted you out let me just

478
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,000
tell you because if it wasn't for this

479
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,950
account there is no way we could have

480
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,870
gotten started it have been so so - yes

481
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,830
so so so we're like thinking okay how do

482
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,440
we get started of course we need to grab

483
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,990
we need to you know use Twitter API to

484
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,900
grab grab this data and put it in a data

485
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,450
store but how what what do we build and

486
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,000
what do we use to do that so we thought

487
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,510
of a serverless solution which is on the

488
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,610
top left here in this graph called a

489
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,480
juror functions it's a service

490
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,370
serverless solution that allows you to

491
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,470
do event-driven event-driven code

492
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,980
execution we were at Microsoft we have a

493
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,540
bunch of credits so and it's the fastest

494
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,460
cheapest way for us to do it we worked

495
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,410
on it look it's what the greatest thing

496
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,429
about working there is you just have

497
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,900
like all of as your like I'll just take

498
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,030
that whole data center for my project

499
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,090
for J Escom oh yeah et nos we've got it

500
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,740
right so and then and then we use we use

501
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,770
that to hit to get get our connect to

502
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,220
the Twitter API we use the 399 version

503
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,920
of that which you know can cause a few

504
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,540
like rate limit issues and I'll talk a

505
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,860
little bit about that in the next slide

506
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,220
of how we overcame that and then we put

507
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,980
that into a datastore and then we used

508
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,490
also cognitive services text API I do

509
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,679
some text analytics on some of the some

510
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,080
of the tweets and then out of all that

511
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,510
is was consumed by graph through a

512
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,120
four-horse just to figure out what the

513
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,220
results are well what the result set was

514
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,690
so we can kind of make sense of all this

515
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,300
data and and one of the important things

516
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,059
here is that this is just the API and

517
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:23,800
this took most of the time almost the

518
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,420
entirety of our time was spent just

519
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,730
building the API which is I feel like

520
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,980
how everything else goes right like 80%

521
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,660
of the work is spent doing something

522
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,510
that nobody ever sees but it's got to be

523
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,860
done we also learned some interesting

524
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,860
things about about Mongo DB because

525
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,880
cosmos TV uses the Mongo DB API I didn't

526
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,530
know much about it I still don't I don't

527
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,500
I would I said jazzing a message be like

528
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,850
can you can you please run this

529
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,530
aggregation query you have no idea

530
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,790
what's going on here and should be like

531
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,390
sure

532
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,570
and yeah my my browser history for the

533
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,790
last like two months has been

534
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,809
fascinating it's all it's all the

535
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:01,510
MongoDB document mine is like every

536
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,970
Stack Overflow post on MongoDB ever ever

537
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,830
I've been there I've been to every

538
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,610
single one so we learned a lot it was

539
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,260
very very difficult and there were a lot

540
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,059
of times we just wanted to quit right

541
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:16,390
yeah but how can you quit when you have

542
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,640
free free credits right right so just to

543
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,799
talk a little about the azure function

544
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,960
that we use we use this function we

545
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,669
called it our function half at horse

546
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:28,900
hunt because I mean obviously we're

547
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,169
hunting for hunting for a horse and what

548
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:34,419
the function app does is it hosts our

549
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,309
functions and then it's also a place

550
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:37,540
where you can add like configuration

551
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,240
file if it configuration so for example

552
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,340
we know Twitter the Twitter API we you

553
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,000
need need keys you need a token keys for

554
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,590
secret we're secret's out of your

555
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,780
firstborn child yeah exactly and and so

556
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,270
so the nice thing about that is that you

557
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,760
know you you have one place to add your

558
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,320
configuration and then all your

559
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,120
functions all your functions already

560
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,740
have access to all of that so you don't

561
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,929
have to you know copy and paste it you

562
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:07,150
know billions of times work for your

563
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,030
functions to work with the API or

564
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,910
whatever else you're connecting it to so

565
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,250
for so the first so we used to event

566
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,919
event function event based functions the

567
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,929
first one is a timer the timer the timer

568
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:22,840
event function and what that does it it

569
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,080
would run we had one that ran at 1:00

570
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,929
a.m. every day and it would get it would

571
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,900
collect the tweets from from the prior

572
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,790
day that horse yes that we didn't have

573
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,350
in our data store yet from the prior day

574
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,750
and dumped it into our cosmos TV

575
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,720
instance and then we came with the

576
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,970
challenge of backfilling going back as

577
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,960
far as we could

578
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,960
we went us back as far as as a horse

579
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,390
plane j/s account did so that we could

580
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,730
kind of easily run our queries and you

581
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,770
know and compare and compare the

582
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,380
original tweets and the horse tweets and

583
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,990
with that that was where we really came

584
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,090
across some reliving issues so we had

585
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,160
this we had a timer trigger or a timer

586
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,390
triggered function

587
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,570
would run run on a schedule and this

588
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,890
really easy to set up and used to do it

589
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,460
with a cron job and it would it stop and

590
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,170
eventually it was done when we told the

591
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:17,410
stuff we kind of had we gave it a few a

592
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,070
few dates a few dates and time and got

593
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,840
and collected as many tweets as we could

594
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,360
and then once that was done we we shut

595
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,920
it off and it's literally as easy as a

596
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,679
click of a button and then when we

597
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,390
wanted to consume that data we used a

598
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,660
HTTP event function and that was what we

599
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,910
used to to get all of our outputs for

600
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:41,260
our queries and our results so what when

601
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,929
it comes to when so in the end like like

602
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:45,580
Burke said we use pretty much built API

603
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,470
that collects the data puts in a

604
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,240
datastore and then also to query that

605
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,480
data now for a cosmos DB we we had a we

606
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,210
had so Kozma DB is a implication of

607
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,880
document DB I believe and what the nice

608
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,400
thing about it is that the the documents

609
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,809
your document structure will all look

610
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:07,000
just will will look the same but the

611
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,460
thing that differs is the API that you

612
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,790
use to to consume your data with so

613
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,410
there's different options for example

614
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,970
there's sequel Cassandra there's a graph

615
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,590
API yeah there's all kinds of stuff the

616
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,110
one we use as mentioned before was

617
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,410
MongoDB and in these two screenshots

618
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,360
here where I'm just it's just an example

619
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,220
of what the structure kind of looked

620
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,470
kind of looked like so we had a horse

621
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,600
object and that would contain the horse

622
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,799
J's tweet and some additional metadata

623
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,000
by the way which was like completely

624
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,500
empty horse Chase is really good at

625
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,900
covering their tracks and then we had an

626
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,780
original object which also had the

627
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,000
original tweet and some additional

628
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,559
metadata in that and then we when we

629
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:56,500
additional initially aside from also

630
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,320
consuming consuming the data and like

631
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,200
running queries to put in charts and

632
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,870
stuff to make sense of this data we also

633
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,590
used the cognitive services API

634
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,780
specifically their text analytics API to

635
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,200
run some analysis on the tweets so

636
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,540
cognitive Services is pretty much the AI

637
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,020
and ml that

638
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,310
you don't have to do we just kind of

639
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,620
it's pretty much just an API it has an

640
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,300
endpoint you give it you give it some

641
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,920
data or you give it some info and it

642
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,350
spits out pizza or gives you return

643
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,960
something back to you and the nice thing

644
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,460
about that is that we don't have to do

645
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,050
we don't have to build our models we

646
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,400
have to do anything we just had to just

647
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,290
hit an API endpoint which is really nice

648
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,840
so what you're looking at here is and

649
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,380
the the demo site for the text analytics

650
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,280
API and what's happening here is that

651
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,260
the SEMO you put on in some text and if

652
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,480
you can see here that I have a text or a

653
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,470
tweet from one of the the the data store

654
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,750
or from one of the text or text from one

655
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,960
of the tweets that was from an original

656
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,890
original one of the original tweets in

657
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,270
our in our cosmos DB instance and and on

658
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,580
to the right there we have we see it's

659
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,990
measuring things like sentiment and

660
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,570
keywords and things like that and then

661
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,120
on the bottom here we is an example of

662
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,000
what it looks like in our database or in

663
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,610
our in our database collection and or in

664
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,850
our collection excuse me and and what we

665
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,980
pretty much really ended up using was

666
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,690
the keyword sentiment was kind of cool

667
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,010
and what sentiment does is it's pretty

668
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,260
much measures whether some whether or

669
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,870
not text is positive or negative so

670
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,720
anything above 50% would be perceived as

671
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,250
positive anything below that's negative

672
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,680
and we didn't really use that but the

673
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,570
keyword the keyword really came in handy

674
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,190
for us right yeah and you'll see that

675
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,410
here in a bit how we use that but that

676
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,000
was that was interesting because the

677
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,920
sentiment is sort of what you think it

678
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,850
would be used for but that's not

679
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,320
actually what we used it we used it for

680
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,110
key phrase recognition and if you would

681
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,420
otherwise have to do by hand right that

682
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,120
would be fun exactly and like and we did

683
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,730
discover that using set the sentiment

684
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,560
analysis on hoarseness one wasn't going

685
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,510
to work at all because because it's not

686
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,310
it's a lot of it's just nonsense or

687
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,950
sarcasm and computers as it turns out

688
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,320
are not great with sarcasm true story

689
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,010
right and and in fact a horse some of

690
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,200
the horses tweets actually broke some of

691
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,880
our functions when we tried to like to

692
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,610
when we tried to get text analysis on it

693
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,340
because even like the text API would say

694
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,240
I don't know what you this is two words

695
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,680
this is not a sentence

696
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,330
sentence like this is not coherent I

697
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,740
can't help so so with that with all that

698
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,830
stuff we finally got some we finally

699
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,820
started to make sense of our day we

700
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,890
started to work on some of the results

701
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,660
so Burke you want to talk a little bit

702
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,980
about those results right you don't want

703
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,140
to talk about results do you want to see

704
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,780
this yes why did you waste so much time

705
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,110
already all right okay let's do it then

706
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,900
all right so here are the results from

707
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,090
all of the work that we did all of the

708
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,890
weeks of sifting through this data here

709
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,760
we go the first analysis that we did is

710
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,980
something called a time series analysis

711
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,560
now I'm about to make some broad and

712
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,810
inaccurate statements about the study of

713
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,840
Statistics because I am NOT an expert in

714
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,120
statistics so don't add me if you want

715
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,040
to come see me later at the party and

716
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,650
explain why I'm wrong I will be happy to

717
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,410
hear you out but for the purposes of

718
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,840
this talk grant me some leniency here as

719
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,670
I say some horribly wrong things here we

720
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,000
go

721
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
a time series analysis is when you look

722
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,960
at a series of events as they occur over

723
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,240
a period of time it's actually quite

724
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,140
simple I can't wait to hear how that was

725
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,150
so terribly wrong but I'm sure I messed

726
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,280
that up so the first thing that we did

727
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,760
was we we took all of the horse J s

728
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,160
tweets and we looked at them over a

729
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,720
period of time so let's do that this is

730
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,700
a graph a scatter of every single horse

731
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,130
J s tweet that we had in the database

732
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,560
something should pop out to you right

733
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,060
away

734
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,460
what do you see

735
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:22,620
they sleep ah are they really a

736
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,809
developer then now this is where this

737
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,070
really starts to get interesting because

738
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,809
what you're gonna see is the same thing

739
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:33,029
we saw which is that we would go in with

740
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:35,009
these assumptions and then we would run

741
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:37,049
these these queries and look at these

742
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:38,940
graphs and Riaan have completely

743
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,980
different realizations so you almost

744
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,470
don't know what you're looking for until

745
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,139
the graph reveals that to you here's

746
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:48,419
what's really interesting on the bottom

747
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,070
here what we're looking at are dates

748
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:53,159
okay so this is 2016 and this is up to

749
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,429
July over here on the side is supposed

750
00:30:56,429 --> 00:30:58,500
to be time

751
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,720
this is chart Jas and I learned to

752
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,029
charge a s about three weeks ago so I

753
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:05,220
have no idea what I'm doing I tried to

754
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,169
convert it into 24-hour format on the

755
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:09,840
side but it's actually not correct let

756
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,490
me tell you what this chart actually

757
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,889
reads right here right here ish is about

758
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:20,360
10:00 p.m. Central Standard Time

759
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,049
okay right here where it picks back up

760
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:28,200
this is about 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.

761
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,740
Central Standard Time what does that

762
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,820
tell us they're in Texas that's right

763
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,970
or they are in the Eastern time zone

764
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,029
they are most likely in Central Standard

765
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:48,619
Time or Eastern Time most likely they're

766
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:50,269
probably not in mountain time because

767
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:51,590
that would be a bedtime of like 9

768
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,179
o'clock and they're definitely not a

769
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,470
Pacific time because it would be a

770
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,629
bedtime of 8 o'clock and waking up and

771
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:58,159
starting tweeting at 4:00 and that

772
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,629
definitely doesn't sound like a

773
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:02,720
developer to me except for a couple of

774
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,609
nights like right here in January this

775
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:06,409
is like 4:30 a.m. I don't know what

776
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:08,059
horse Jess was doing but there was a big

777
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,450
party in January also this one here this

778
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,039
was also a late night I don't know what

779
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,479
not sure what's happening there new

780
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,909
years it could been yeah exactly

781
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:18,320
but other than that they're getting a

782
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,700
good eight hours of sleep and they're

783
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,440
not active at night good for you horse

784
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,629
j/s healthy lifestyle choices okay

785
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:28,190
so the next thing we want to do here is

786
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,619
we want to look at the original tweets

787
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:31,970
the quoted tweets we're going to do the

788
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,849
same analysis on those tweets okay so

789
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:37,849
here's those tweets now what you'll

790
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:41,349
notice is that it looks kind of the same

791
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:46,119
okay we've got this big opening here

792
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:49,129
it's a little bit more populated but it

793
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:53,450
looks remarkably the same what can we

794
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,759
glean from that well we could assume

795
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,330
that possibly horse j/s is quoting

796
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,340
people that are in the same time zone so

797
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,529
they're quoting friends people that they

798
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:04,729
know people that live in close proximity

799
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:07,580
maybe again we're making assumptions

800
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,779
from the data here but we don't know

801
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:13,940
anything yet at this point I said okay

802
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,710
well let's do this let's overlay the

803
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,830
horse data on top of the original data

804
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,229
and see what we get I'm not sure what I

805
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:26,029
was expecting to find that just sounded

806
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:31,259
like something you would do with a chart

807
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:37,190
so this is what we've got now this is

808
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,029
interesting the blue dots are the

809
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:45,169
original tweets okay the the red dots or

810
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:47,720
the pinkish dots are horses tweets

811
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,379
now on accident I gave these things a

812
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:54,470
transparency of 0.5 because I thought it

813
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,179
was pretty but that actually was

814
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:00,649
interesting because what you'll notice

815
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:02,240
is there are some places where it is

816
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,629
pink bright pink see there you see there

817
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:08,599
you see there you know what's happening

818
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,119
there what's happening there same time

819
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,770
these tweets are occurring at almost the

820
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,710
exact same time some of them within

821
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:26,690
seconds of each other they doesn't lie

822
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:32,119
that is awful quick just saying so from

823
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,490
this we made this assumption that okay

824
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,290
if the tweets are very close together

825
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,649
let's say 60 seconds or less it's highly

826
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:46,579
likely that horse Jas is following those

827
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:48,020
people directly now remember I'm

828
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,639
operating under the assumption that this

829
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,560
person sees the tweet and then tweets as

830
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,849
horse J s okay so I said let's pull out

831
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:59,810
all of the tweets that occur within 60

832
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,180
seconds of the original tweet so let's

833
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,089
do that

834
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:07,579
there they are okay you'll see that this

835
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:09,890
there's like this one over here again I

836
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,560
told you I'm terrible at charge a s I'd

837
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,119
like to apologize at the charge a s

838
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,500
people their product deserves better

839
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,510
than me

840
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,980
okay so there's not a lot of them okay

841
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,290
now if we spread this out to like five

842
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,940
minutes to 10 minutes it starts to get

843
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,440
more interesting but then may that's a

844
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,690
lot of time on Twitter y'all five

845
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,060
minutes is a ton of time the other thing

846
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,510
is is that the analysis that we then did

847
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,780
from here is we said okay for each one

848
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,030
of these people let's get all of their

849
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,520
followers from the Twitter API okay and

850
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,490
then we can compare those followers and

851
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,790
see which followers do those accounts

852
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,310
have in common and that's how we're

853
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:57,290
going to get them

854
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,400
and that was an incredibly difficult

855
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,100
task here's why Brendan Eich was one of

856
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,660
those people and that dude's got like

857
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,550
200,000 followers West boss was one of

858
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,830
those people that guys got like 200,000

859
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,230
followers and what we really quickly

860
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,890
learned is first of all the Twitter API

861
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,690
just rate limited the crap out of us I

862
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,820
mean it was just all day long so that

863
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,100
was that was number one so basically

864
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,450
what you'd have to do is you would test

865
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,800
but then when she hit the rate limit

866
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,920
used to stop for 15 minutes and wait

867
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,470
some imagine that as a dev process right

868
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,090
sometimes I would just end our did we

869
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,620
just end our days like oh great limits

870
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,600
happen again let's just go he done so

871
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,270
yeah all right so what we did was we had

872
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,830
to set up these processes that would

873
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,270
recover by themselves so we did that and

874
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:51,760
here's what we found

875
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,120
all right so after all this what do we

876
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,560
know horse jeaious is probably in

877
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,420
central time or eastern time or the rest

878
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,880
of it was a vast waste of my time so

879
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,830
when it comes to frequency analysis I

880
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,990
don't have as good as a definition as

881
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,910
Berk does he as Brooke did for time

882
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,710
series or for the time series analysis

883
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,480
so I'm not gonna give you an example or

884
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,450
I'm going to show you the example of

885
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:18,660
what frequency analysis is and when it

886
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,150
hasn't released our project or project

887
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,480
horse so one thing that we did is that

888
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,290
we ran an aggregation query to find out

889
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,840
the people that horse Jess had quoted

890
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,250
more than five times and this is pretty

891
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,990
much answering the question what is

892
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,790
horse you know who does horse just like

893
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,770
to tweet whose horse just like to quote

894
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,800
and so from this we got some really

895
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,230
interesting from some interesting data

896
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,360
and some interesting results so if you

897
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,870
notice who you're your left guess your

898
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,510
left your left here that there is

899
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,390
somebody who has been quoted a lot of

900
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,060
times and then there's also a cluster of

901
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,100
people after that have been quoted

902
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,830
pretty pretty often as well and then

903
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,560
notice that

904
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,530
as as you move over to the right there

905
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,960
starts to level off a little bit and

906
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,150
level off a bit so it seems that

907
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,900
horseshoes has a circle of people or

908
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,810
other friends or maybe he's just or

909
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,330
maybe they are just a superfan or maybe

910
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,150
they are just reordered maybe they have

911
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,530
that private list I don't know I'm still

912
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,970
convinced and it might they might have a

913
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:32,350
private list but anyway but so we so we

914
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,570
kind of focus in on those on that right

915
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,590
we're right on that high number of

916
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,230
quotes that occurrence of recurrences of

917
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,770
quotes per account and we when we take a

918
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,510
look we took a little bit closer look at

919
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,210
that and we we use the metadata from

920
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,970
from those from those tweets to gather

921
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,290
some more info you want talk a little

922
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,730
bit more about that book yeah absolutely

923
00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:00,040
so it's important to note that here we

924
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,810
we kind of decided that horse J us

925
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,500
probably tweets themselves a lot again

926
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,880
because it would take a lot of restraint

927
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,590
not to do that and we just feel like

928
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,450
that's not who that is

929
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,000
that just that to us just does not

930
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,770
restraint does not sound like horse

931
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,410
neighs so what you're looking at here is

932
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,200
a Graham app here of all of the people

933
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,850
that live in either central or Eastern

934
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:25,480
time there's only six of all these

935
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,430
people and yes I know the names are

936
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,980
bordered at the bottom we're trying to

937
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,050
obscure some data here of all of these

938
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:36,040
people only six one of them is in Texas

939
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,840
and there are five in the New York area

940
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,050
all right so from this we can again make

941
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,800
a few assumptions about horse jeaious we

942
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,780
could make the assumption and we sort of

943
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,980
did that horse jeaious probably lives in

944
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,540
the New York area also of these other

945
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,770
four people that are in the New York

946
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,690
area with them almost all of those

947
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,700
people are on the left side of this

948
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,270
chart so it is highly likely that horse

949
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,970
a s is in New York or the New York area

950
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,500
they have a group of friends in that

951
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,900
area they are they are quoting those

952
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,970
people because their friends and it's

953
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,210
funny so we decided from this

954
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,310
that horse Jas lives in the Eastern time

955
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,320
zone which took us to the next part in

956
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,520
which we learned about some machine

957
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,920
learning yeah so this is the output of

958
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,550
the text analysis that we got and so so

959
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,290
like I showed you before we put all our

960
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,510
text analysis in a separate collection

961
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,599
ran an aggregate query I got really good

962
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,339
at arrogation if you if you ever need

963
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:42,609
everybody I had never used MongoDB

964
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:43,900
before so it was a learning experience

965
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,260
to start a consulting service for good

966
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,200
to be aggregation queries and what we

967
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,270
did is rent aggregation query on all the

968
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,190
keywords we want to kind of figure out

969
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,810
this is kind of answering the question

970
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:59,920
what does what makes horse GS tweet our

971
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,170
quote specific tweets what what are the

972
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,750
keywords that makes horse jeaious want

973
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,020
to want to quote a tweet and if you take

974
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,839
a look here so actually so on the left

975
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:12,400
here the first two there are kind of

976
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,140
kind of Givens there JavaScript and

977
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,650
jeaious

978
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,720
and I feel like that's kind of like even

979
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,369
those are even though even though those

980
00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:19,599
are blurred I think that those are

981
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,980
probably a given you would you'd

982
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,540
probably assume that those it would be

983
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,450
first two and then there was some in

984
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,880
here that were actually kind of

985
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,760
surprising for example node was a rule

986
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,540
further to the right and and that was to

987
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,820
the and then also there was which is

988
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,140
actually kind of interesting because it

989
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,480
actually came I believe came before it

990
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,490
was there was more NPM than node

991
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:44,740
significantly more NPM yeah it was like

992
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,420
a little further further apart from each

993
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,830
other on the chart which is actually

994
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,330
really interesting because you would

995
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,980
think that they would kind of be like a

996
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,480
little bit more equal because they can

997
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,070
only think when I think of note I think

998
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,830
also of NPM so it was that was a little

999
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,520
interesting but yeah so the the the

1000
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,810
interesting thing about that even though

1001
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,510
that we didn't really gather too much

1002
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:09,339
about our about a who horse yes is from

1003
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:12,480
from this chart we did we did kind of

1004
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,500
confirm some of our assumptions for

1005
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,050
example we thought we assumed that

1006
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,240
horses web developer and the keywords

1007
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,460
that we got from our aggregation and

1008
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,859
this chart kind of confirmed some of

1009
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:25,690
those stuff right and and once we figure

1010
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:26,950
out who was that there was actually a

1011
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,330
key piece of evidence in here that we're

1012
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,859
not showing you that was actually like

1013
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:32,000
yep of course it is

1014
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,090
all right um so the last thing we

1015
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,490
alright sources and this one's this

1016
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,020
one's super interesting so remember we

1017
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,760
talked about whenever you commit a crime

1018
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,380
there's 20 pieces of evidence that you

1019
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,700
leave behind that point directly to you

1020
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,450
this is it so whenever you tweet just

1021
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:52,610
FYI there is a sources property that you

1022
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,970
are sending that is the origination of

1023
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,670
your tweet and that could be the web

1024
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,420
that could be your device your tablet

1025
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,660
whatever it is you send a source to

1026
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,490
Twitter and Twitter records that source

1027
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,240
and horse jeaious is no exception it

1028
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,020
recorded that source for them and lucky

1029
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,180
for us that source was kind of

1030
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,380
interesting on the left we have the web

1031
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,930
client and on the right we have Android

1032
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,180
now here's what's really interesting of

1033
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,130
all those people in the chart that we

1034
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,380
showed you before there's only a handful

1035
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,760
using Android

1036
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,950
and of all the six people that were our

1037
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:47,260
suspects in New York there's only one

1038
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,550
and this was the moment at Friday where

1039
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,710
I said to Jasmine oh my gosh

1040
00:43:54,710 --> 00:44:08,870
we got him

1041
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,200
so what do we know we know they're

1042
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,080
located in New York we know that there

1043
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,400
are certain subjects that they tweet

1044
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,290
about more than others we have obscured

1045
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,920
those results from you we know that they

1046
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,980
are one of our six suspects and we know

1047
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,450
that they use Android so with that and

1048
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,760
some key information that we have not

1049
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,050
shown you otherwise you'd be able to

1050
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:36,990
piece this together for yourself are you

1051
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,860
ready to find out who horse jeaious is

1052
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,240
[Music]

1053
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,490
so we kind of also have a public service

1054
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:52,090
now if you decide to you know do this

1055
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,480
repeat this experiment for either horse

1056
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,280
chess or any another anonymous Twitter

1057
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,080
account we just wanna let you know that

1058
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,960
doxxing is not cool if you're going to

1059
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,030
do it please be sure to protect people's

1060
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,010
identities it's not it's not fair don't

1061
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,120
bring a lot of unwanted attention to

1062
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,670
people who might not want it so yeah

1063
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:13,600
just be good ethical yeah exactly yeah

1064
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,230
if people want to remain anonymous let's

1065
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,300
let them remain anonymous we reached out

1066
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,980
to horse yes and we said hey is it okay

1067
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,500
if we get up on the stage and say your

1068
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,220
name and they said yes absolutely yeah
