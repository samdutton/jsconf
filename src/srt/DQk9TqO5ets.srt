00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:15,639

thank you thank you so hello everyone

2
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,290
this is going to be interesting

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,779
apparently many people like a dirty B

4
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:22,510
front end and C tricks so that's pretty

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,520
cool now it's not going to be easy

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,990
because you know I don't want to do the

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,880
hard work so you you're going to do the

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,710
hard work the way we're going to do it

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,720
because they are really dirty I have to

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,239
warn you first the things are going to

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,350
see you will not be able to unsee and I

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,510
don't take any credit or responsibility

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,489
of what happens next once you saw them

14
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:45,910
right they are really bad like seriously

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,309
bad so we'll see how it goes now the way

16
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,620
it's going to go just to be a bit more

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,039
fun

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,059
I brought some chocolate with me so I'm

19
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:56,920
going to post challenges and we're going

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,239
to probably cover like 10 or 15

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,460
challenges and if you think that you

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,620
have a good idea just shout and I'll try

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,230
my best to throw the little piece of

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,780
chocolate at you I don't take any credit

25
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,909
or responsibility of whether I hit you

26
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,430
or not right again but this is going to

27
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,409
be fun alright so let's go now this is

28
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:18,970
me this is how you stole flag back in

29
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,979
the day things do change over time I

30
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,689
currently do live in Vilnius in the

31
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,610
Vienna which is why this check out is

32
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,649
from Vilnius Lithuania but I'm still

33
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,299
editing most of the stuff and smashing

34
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:29,920
and also I do a lot of consultancy these

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,540
days they spend a lot of time in

36
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,299
companies and companies real fun

37
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,100
sometimes especially the enterprise-e

38
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,259
corporate and you know this kind of

39
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,509
thing because they tend up to find to

40
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,710
kind of come up with really interesting

41
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,320
pragmatic solutions to anything right

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,680
people can solve everything seriously in

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,439
a interesting creative way so let's see

44
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,649
all right you ready that doesn't sound

45
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,380
very exciting you have to talk to me

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,850
already all right this is better all

47
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,409
right so let's have some simple stuff

48
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,320
that's not too complicated I think so

49
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,530
here's the task for you right so what if

50
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,720
you need to nest one link inside another

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,510
for example inside notes footnotes or

52
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,100
articles when you want the entire

53
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,110
excerpt to be linked but you also want

54
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,480
the excerpt to contain potentially

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,160
contain links which lead to another site

56
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,290
right so you might encounter things like

57
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,010
that

58
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,230
right I have a product image maybe or

59
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,209
product description so you have a block

60
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:30,849
of text right which is a link but at the

61
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,500
same time you might have links inside of

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,810
that paragraph which should stay links

63
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,239
as well now how would you do it without

64
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,530
JavaScript can you have nested links in

65
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,930
HTML that's not very clear to me at this

66
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,849
point so if you say yes you have to tell

67
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:51,540
the eye how you do it

68
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:59,739
anybody button and an anchor inside not

69
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:01,659
sure about that okay somebody said

70
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,409
object

71
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:08,660
who said object all right so here we go

72
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,989
I'm trying my best here come on

73
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,150
seriously so there are many solutions

74
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,379
right so one thing that we could do

75
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,400
potentially is of course use

76
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,379
position:absolute to put the link on top

77
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,690
of the paragraph and also use that index

78
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,159
to kind of make it work

79
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,200
but you know we can use object type

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,450
because it's fancier why well if we

81
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,069
actually try to nest a link inside of

82
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,019
another link what browser is going to do

83
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:30,849
is assume that you're stupid and it's

84
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,319
going to close the first thing for you

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,209
but it's not going to reopen it so in

86
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,799
the end you end up with this part of the

87
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,660
paragraph not being a link anymore right

88
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,730
which is the problem now we can solve it

89
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,849
why well how well by just putting up the

90
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,910
anchor inside of the object tag why the

91
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,069
hell would you do that because object

92
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,079
behaves very much like SVG or iframe if

93
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,299
you think if you like so the browser

94
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,310
will actually just ignore whatever is

95
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,430
inside so it won't say it's so dirty

96
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,560
everything that's inside objects so

97
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,329
dirty I'm not even going to touch it so

98
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:02,889
I'm going to keep it as it is so it's

99
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,199
going to work just as expected right now

100
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,790
I don't say that this is cool and this

101
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,079
is you there's something that you should

102
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,970
do but it's useful to know this because

103
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,530
if you encounter situation when you

104
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,970
can't use JavaScript for some reason

105
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,280
kind of close link opening closing

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,159
opening then you can actually use it and

107
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:20,859
in fact if you want to make it work

108
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,789
in older ie you can use conditional

109
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,400
comments inside object which is probably

110
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,570
the worst thing I ever said in my life

111
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,849
but you know this does work and if you

112
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:32,469
feel really comfortable with this or

113
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:34,090
uncomfortable you can look at the

114
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,560
kittens if you do feel comfortable you

115
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,480
can read the entire article which

116
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,790
the entire thing or again you can just

117
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,920
use position:absolute on top of the

118
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,040
paragraph but object is really awesome

119
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,250
for two reasons actually first of all

120
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,230
because everybody hates it and second of

121
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,930
all because you can actually embed SVG's

122
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,060
in a very smart way now there are many

123
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,280
ways of embedding SVG on the page right

124
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,950
um you can do it in line you can you

125
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,450
know you can just use image source and

126
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,250
background image and so on but have you

127
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,190
tried to embed an SVG file on the page

128
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,480
using the object tag this is awesome

129
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,260
right

130
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,970
why well first of all if you actually

131
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,620
embed it in the regular way just by

132
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,360
using image source or background I'm

133
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,050
kind of cold and sorry dense kind of

134
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,240
blocks as access to the SVG path so if

135
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,180
we have an SVG on SVG file it contains

136
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,620
some paths that we want to you know

137
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,720
change the thickness of or change the

138
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,580
color we can't do it if we embed it this

139
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,100
way right we can inline it but then it's

140
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,720
not cacheable which is a problem we can

141
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,940
also base64 it but it's again the same

142
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,160
story so what can we do well this is the

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,380
best thing we can do sitting by actually

144
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,600
so we can embed it as inside of the

145
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,670
object tag using just a proper type

146
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,370
attribute and then inside of the object

147
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,280
SVG thing inside of the SVG file we can

148
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,590
use media queries and JavaScript and CSS

149
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,050
and whatever you like and this CSS can

150
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,430
be styling can actually style the actual

151
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,740
path on whatever we have in the SVG just

152
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,570
you know on hover or whatever whatever

153
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,700
you want to do now this works really

154
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,630
well in even in those old browsers right

155
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,100
that's pretty cool

156
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,440
it's good to know that we can use that

157
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,330
all right here's another one now by

158
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,710
default we know I mean we're going to

159
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,450
have lots of them so get ready

160
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,430
by default broken images look freaking

161
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,410
spectacular right so if there is

162
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,180
actually any way to improve the

163
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,360
experience by changing the styling if

164
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,300
images are actually broken right because

165
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,410
this is what we're getting most of the

166
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,050
time if an image cannot be loaded then

167
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,250
we're going to get this little

168
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,280
placeholder finger with a broken image

169
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,210
inside it does not very you know cool

170
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,629
can you change it how

171
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:54,099
mm okay tough drop I see who said that

172
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:58,639
okay I'm pretty good today I'm seriously

173
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,080
right so here's the interesting part

174
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,939
that you need to know now the image

175
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,499
element if you look in the spec you'll

176
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:04,909
find lots of really interesting stuff in

177
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,589
there the image element is a so-called

178
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:08,809
replaced element it's an element whose

179
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:11,059
appearance and dimensions are defined by

180
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:13,189
an external resource make sense however

181
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:15,020
absolute elements should not work on it

182
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,839
unless the image cannot be lauded so

183
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,699
even the image can not be lauded the

184
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:22,069
before and after two tournaments will be

185
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,169
applied and they will not be applied if

186
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,719
an image is loaded right so we can do

187
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,210
all kind of starting to improve the

188
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,639
experience of the you know broken images

189
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,399
without doing too much at this point and

190
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,319
it just works we just apply before and

191
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,059
after to image and voila you're done I

192
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,919
see a lot of excitement in here it's

193
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,610
great it's going great right so this

194
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,889
works really well okay but maybe this is

195
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,419
not too practical so let's talk about

196
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,129
something really practical something

197
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:54,020
that you probably should be using every

198
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,559
single day on every single project so we

199
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,599
like fluid type right and we often have

200
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,699
to implement fluid typography to make

201
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,439
sure that everything scales up and down

202
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,449
beautifully as designers intend to do it

203
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,959
right now how do we do it well if you

204
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,459
wanted to be really fluid you will

205
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,860
probably tighten up the font size

206
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,800
together with the VH OVW unit right so

207
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,479
all the time whenever the browser is

208
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,719
Croesus the window whenever the browser

209
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:22,969
window increases you also will have the

210
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,430
increase in the font size it's great but

211
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,409
then you know it can even grow

212
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,779
infinitely and it can become very very

213
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,669
small which is kind of not what we want

214
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,649
we want to have nice boundaries right

215
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,959
this is what would love to achieve and

216
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,880
we wanted to be reduced kind of scale up

217
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,889
and down nicely but not necessarily

218
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:42,349
proportionally just growing like nuts or

219
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,110
getting smaller we wanted to be kind of

220
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,540
in control now the problem is following

221
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,829
now we could use something like this

222
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,079
right okay just set the font size being

223
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:55,160
the calc of 1 M plus 1 plus 1 BW right

224
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,339
we we double use of course 1% of the

225
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,920
viewport width right now that works but

226
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,870
then in that case 1 am why do we

227
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,080
it well because we want to have kind of

228
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,360
minimum font size right that's okay

229
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,360
that helps us but not quite now now we

230
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,730
can do something like this when we just

231
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,940
included like for VW and for the agent

232
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,830
to be mean for example and we'll all

233
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,890
scale up and down but what if we're

234
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,830
talking about the pro graphics scale we

235
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,839
don't just want something to grow we

236
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,820
want to have a specific kind of not

237
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,000
breakpoints but specific docking points

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,040
where the type will grow to wards so

239
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,339
converge towards right so what if we

240
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,800
wanted to choose a font size of 16

241
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,660
pixels at the screen resolution of 400

242
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,029
pixels and then we wanted to transition

243
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:48,050
to 24 pixels at a resolution of 800 can

244
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:55,430
we do it without the break point a lot

245
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,900
of excitement in the room oh great all

246
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,460
right no but seriously can indeed have

247
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,410
any like a problem like this before or

248
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,510
design a country wants to have a nice

249
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,300
typographic scale like 1/3 or minus 3rd

250
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,200
or whatever and you have to build it how

251
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
would you build it so it scales down and

252
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:20,029
are beautifully everywhere no don't have

253
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,589
but no actually it's a bit more

254
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,839
complicated I just need to use a little

255
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,589
formula to make it work so that a second

256
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,779
that's okay that's okay it's going to

257
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,580
fun in reality it's not that complicated

258
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,800
so of course what do you have again we

259
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,540
have a special boundary I say between

260
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,850
400 pixels and 800 pixels and you have a

261
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,660
specific size like growth between

262
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,490
starting font size and final font size

263
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,740
right so you just plug it in here you've

264
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,440
got kind of the maximum subscreen size

265
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,000
minus minimum screen size where you're

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,470
talking about like the spectrum that

267
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,720
you're walking at and then here at this

268
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,490
point you're kind of subtracting 100%

269
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,190
100 PW minus 4 horn pixels at this point

270
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,990
you are getting to the area like what is

271
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,540
where am I either lower lower boundary

272
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,000
or in the upper boundary right and then

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
you multiply it with difference between

274
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,120
the maximum font size and mean font size

275
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,010
and you add the minimum font size and

276
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,100
you're done

277
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,480
that's really not complicated right so

278
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,499
the only thing you have to do is you

279
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:21,999
have to define all these four values

280
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:24,100
you've set them and you're done right

281
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,540
and then this is what it looks like so

282
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,369
you have your modular scale right

283
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:34,240
and all these headings including

284
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,800
typography like the body copy as well

285
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,959
are just going to flew it and kind of

286
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:39,879
grow naturally without you having to do

287
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,889
anything without even single media query

288
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:43,720
and without flexbox without anything

289
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,399
just with one little property that's

290
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,949
really cool right we actually published

291
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:49,269
an article about this which you can also

292
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,309
read on so in just in case you're

293
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,920
wondering calc is really damn good well

294
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,470
supported except you know who but we're

295
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,050
used to it right but this is not quite

296
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,420
what you want sometimes I mean that's

297
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,920
cool if you can just grow and and if the

298
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,050
font size can grow and actually become

299
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,119
smaller but what about the line height

300
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,339
because as we know from the Fogg Rafi

301
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,230
the smaller the font sizes or the small

302
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,350
the line lengths is the small the line

303
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,910
height should be as well and the other

304
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,449
way around

305
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,360
the largest their length is the taller

306
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,279
the line height should be as well can we

307
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,660
fix that maybe you want to have

308
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,839
something like this right automatically

309
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:31,119
without JavaScript without too many you

310
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,829
know fancy mate we're breaking points

311
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,869
just we want it to be fluid and just

312
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:37,329
right again we have the same problem

313
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:39,040
exactly right we have these two

314
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,019
boundaries let's say we have a minimum

315
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,179
line height one point free at some point

316
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,189
if it's smaller than that it's just not

317
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:47,290
going to work well right and also if

318
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,480
you're going to worry above 1.5 it's

319
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,490
going to be too wide right so we have

320
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,160
this nice boundary between 1.3 and 1 to

321
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,049
5 and we just need to define where it's

322
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:57,699
going to operate so it's going to

323
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,769
operate maybe in a layout between 21 mm

324
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,869
sent to 35 amps you plug it in the

325
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:05,379
formula you do a little bit of math

326
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:07,299
right you plug it's the formula and

327
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:10,149
you're done it's exactly the same story

328
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,069
just for the line height we're here

329
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,889
we've got we got the full range of

330
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:18,040
paragraph width in here 35 minus 21 then

331
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,170
some point in here we we just look at

332
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,910
the account we need to open numerator to

333
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,709
see how close we are to the upper

334
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:25,569
boundary and then we also need to

335
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:27,160
multiply it with the difference in terms

336
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,480
of wine height to get to this proper

337
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,110
factor

338
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,959
and then we also add the minimum phone

339
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,760
line height at this point and we're done

340
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,430
right and that's really really amazing

341
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,500
and in the end you get this which

342
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,170
without media queries again without

343
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:49,250
flexbox without anything it just works

344
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,730
right and if you actually make the

345
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,579
window a little bit smaller please

346
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,990
whatever yes that's okay we saw it

347
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,579
already

348
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:02,490
just move on I'll get the life yes/no or

349
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,690
whatever but it will actually work as

350
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,510
expected all right here's the next one

351
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,709
so how do you make sure that a

352
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:11,380
multi-column table both a row and a

353
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,660
column are highlighted on hava and on

354
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,790
tap now highlighting the current draw is

355
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,370
easy we can just use TR hover but what

356
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,200
about the column this is what we want

357
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,450
right we want to be able to kind of tap

358
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,410
on 22 and we want both the column and

359
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,820
the role to be highlighted without

360
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:35,769
JavaScript who was that okay not my best

361
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:37,690
one yeah we can just use two the ones

362
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,860
because this is the best thing you can

363
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,170
have in CSS so this has a few magical

364
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,820
properties which just work everywhere

365
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,130
and like like amazing area all the time

366
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,800
apes or elements and be flexbox if you

367
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,959
can't do something with in CSS try

368
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,910
flexbox if it doesn't work try more

369
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,800
flags box if it still has a more type

370
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,510
Sedonas this is my strategy for

371
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,339
everything I'm sorry I succeeded so far

372
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:59,740
so please try the two now how can we do

373
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,620
it with two elements without JavaScript

374
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,540
all right this is really nasty maybe you

375
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,430
should not be using CSS for this but you

376
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,279
can write so we can create huge pseudo

377
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,899
and on top of that table that we have

378
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:13,329
with a negative top value of half of

379
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,269
that value then we hide the pseudo

380
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:19,029
elements with overflow:hidden put on the

381
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,769
table then we use negative that in next

382
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,300
we can actually copy paste the content

383
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,120
and we've got it and then we can of

384
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,470
course also use make also focus upon

385
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,910
focus that montage start maybe with a

386
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,699
bit of JavaScript right but when I saw

387
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,390
this for the first time in my life I

388
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,010
literally freaked out and even cried a

389
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,649
little bit just a little bit because you

390
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,970
can apply to the element

391
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,800
to the classes and can apply to the

392
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,660
classism to the elements can apply to

393
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,120
the elements and to the elements

394
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,170
probably and it can apply to the

395
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,699
classroom see the classes so at this

396
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:53,379
point what we're creating is we have

397
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,240
this table creating huge through the

398
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,769
element that covers the entire table

399
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,509
with a width of hundred percent because

400
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:00,399
this is the maximum width right and with

401
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,689
the height well we don't know what it's

402
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:03,069
going to be so we set it in ten thousand

403
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:04,990
pixels then we actually just move it all

404
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,850
up to minus five thousand pixels so it's

405
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,769
kind of centered and then we use you

406
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,329
know we put it to the left well just so

407
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:12,009
it's you know just to be sure and then

408
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,300
we use background color current color

409
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,459
just because we can and then we can use

410
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:17,529
that index minus one so we kind of push

411
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:20,290
the content to the top so above the

412
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,470
table so we can copy/paste it and we're

413
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,810
done right and we can also of course

414
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,620
apply to th as well if we want to it's

415
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,389
actually really simple now you don't

416
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,310
need to ask you for that right that's

417
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,829
pretty cool now this is not that bad

418
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,000
this is not too dirty

419
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,579
let's talk dirty so who has a pleasure

420
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:45,519
of eventually building email layouts

421
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,059
maybe responsive email layouts a few

422
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:51,639
people so these people who are building

423
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,680
responsive emails can you please come

424
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,550
after the talk in here so we can hug you

425
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,410
because this is really really bad I mean

426
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,519
this is really really difficult now

427
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,199
first of all it's not because you know

428
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:04,089
we don't have proper CSS support not

429
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,589
because we don't have proper job oh we

430
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,449
don't have JavaScript at all images are

431
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,100
not loaded usually what if alt and we

432
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,390
have to deal with things like Outlook

433
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,230
and other very similar creatures which

434
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,699
is no fun at all and you want to make it

435
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,699
responsive good luck because Google

436
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,230
Gmail does not support media queries

437
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,419
because of security reasons they say but

438
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:24,400
they will know if they are not intending

439
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,020
to support media queries so how would

440
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,640
you then build a responsive email that

441
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,100
works well in Gmail now especially if

442
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,600
you know if you're opening an email that

443
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,980
looks broken it's not like you're going

444
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,630
to go to desktop to seen in defense of

445
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,179
you you're just deleting it right so

446
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:40,630
well let's be fix it in fact when you're

447
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,340
talking about responsive email it feels

448
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,750
like we're really going back in time

449
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,370
when things used to be

450
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,429
you know mmm ie 6 & 7 & 8 things like

451
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:50,409
that because most of the time still

452
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:52,630
today although every second almost every

453
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,390
second email is opened on mobile

454
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,919
they still

455
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,710
most of the time so email designers and

456
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,640
developers to come up with very

457
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,159
interesting techniques including

458
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:05,770
background coloring for example because

459
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,330
images are not loaded by default except

460
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,580
if it's Gmail so they will be covering

461
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,980
kind of coloring the background cell

462
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,390
because of course you're using table

463
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,779
layouts at this point just in case table

464
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:18,549
layout so we can actually color every

465
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,559
cell now sometimes you can be really

466
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,330
creative with it I was working with a

467
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,100
guy who was in a project but it was

468
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,360
really important for them to actually

469
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,370
display an image even if image is not

470
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,649
displayed or cannot be displayed in

471
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:34,179
email client hmm so it was really really

472
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,590
important like it was a button it

473
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,179
couldn't be just a button obviously it

474
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:38,860
couldn't be just you know itself it

475
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,870
should had to be an image that had to be

476
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,880
displayed they came up with really

477
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,950
interesting idea again you will never

478
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,289
forget this but of course you can

479
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:50,770
transform or convert an image into an

480
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:57,610
HTML table by you know for every pixel

481
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,260
that you have in an image you can

482
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,990
convert it into 1 x 1 TD with that

483
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,330
background color it's going to be a big

484
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,480
huge HTML of course but if you set it if

485
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,730
you do it right and you put an anchor

486
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,669
around that table it will work in

487
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:18,250
Outlook right so this is what people

488
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,120
come up with now this is really bad I'm

489
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,159
not encouraging you to do it but just in

490
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:25,720
case you need to do it some people can

491
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,130
come up with really interesting ideas

492
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,590
right so this is like you know but we

493
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,600
can do some stuff because we have type

494
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,950
of properties that actually behave

495
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,080
properly so we can do you know if you

496
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,779
have let's say if you have let's say

497
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,270
like to here four columns

498
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,750
I think of six no no here four and here

499
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,640
- right if you want to move from four to

500
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,980
two columns you know with tables we can

501
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,630
do this we just have to display them as

502
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,610
block instead of table cell and set the

503
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,380
width properly right if we want to kind

504
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,940
of move the columns around we can also

505
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,220
do this by just using the table header

506
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,990
open table footer group properties there

507
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,640
are four of them there will footer group

508
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,549
table header group table caption and

509
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,929
table cell of course and something else

510
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,789
and the interesting part is if you look

511
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,409
into the spec and it's probably the best

512
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,330
thing you can do like spec is

513
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,400
best evening lecture you can have right

514
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,770
it's so fascinating sometimes because

515
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,540
you know with flexbox we can reorder

516
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,910
components or reorder kind of things in

517
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,610
the layout and Dom that's great but we

518
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,900
could do that with table properties as

519
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,850
well because if we have let's say free

520
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,430
problem three elements a b c and we want

521
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,070
to have we can't use media queries for

522
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,510
example for gmail but we want to

523
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,090
reshuffle them or reorder them to be a c

524
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,730
we just have to define B as stable

525
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,720
footer header group a as table cell and

526
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,880
C a stable food group and they're going

527
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,010
to reshuffle because the header always

528
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,750
lives above the table the food always

529
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,580
seems below the table and table cell in

530
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,860
between and table caption between the

531
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,780
table cell and table for the group right

532
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,820
so we can reshuffle up to four elements

533
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,650
in a very high can dirty way if we want

534
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,270
to make it work for you know all the

535
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,770
clients so that's great we're going to

536
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,570
use these kind of things everywhere and

537
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,250
sometimes you also need to use of course

538
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,670
this little thingy well just in case

539
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,840
you're wondering just for Yahoo because

540
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,130
they are otherwise doesn't understand

541
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,650
classes so we need to put it in the

542
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,390
attribute selector so that's kind of

543
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,780
nice in a way but this is what you will

544
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,760
end up with in the end right but this is

545
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,140
not quite what we want because we want

546
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,100
to make it work in Gmail so let's say we

547
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,260
have a four column layout and a large

548
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,120
screen we want to make it two columns in

549
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,340
a small screen on a small screen or

550
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,230
maybe even simpler we have two columns

551
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,030
from large screen and one column on the

552
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,770
small screen right we just want to stack

553
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,920
things in Gmail today we can make it

554
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,890
work or do you know how to make it work

555
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,580
now this is really really bad I mean

556
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,350
people who watch me at this point will

557
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,840
be totally devastated and go facepalm

558
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,450
all the time I think but we can make it

559
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,450
work with calc with with ant marks with

560
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,360
so can you tell me who is going to win

561
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,390
if we set this on our CSS box so we set

562
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,180
the width on 320 pixels we set the min

563
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,000
width on 480 pixels and marks with on

564
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,980
160 pixels

565
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,340
who is going who think that width is

566
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,730
going to win who thinks that men will

567
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,220
mean which is going to win good thing

568
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,230
that marks which is going to win who is

569
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,730
literally wondering what the hell I'm

570
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,370
doing here

571
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,720
so this is really interesting because

572
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,510
the answer is it depends so if we look

573
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,400
into the spec which is again and very

574
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,080
interesting lecture that they can

575
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,850
actually read at night you'll find read

576
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,190
a lot of interesting stuff for example

577
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,750
if the width value is greater than the

578
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,660
max with marks with winds now that we

579
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,190
understand that makes sense right

580
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,570
because marks which kind of restricts

581
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,309
the growth or restricts the width right

582
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:54,760
let's make sense however and that's the

583
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,530
interesting part if the mean weight

584
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,690
value is greater than the width or max

585
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:03,520
width then mean with winds okay let's

586
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,800
read it again if the min width value is

587
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,230
greater than the width or max width then

588
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,040
mean with winds we can abuse it in so

589
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,820
many different ways right so let's say

590
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,440
we want to make it work in Gmail without

591
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,410
media queue so how how can we do it like

592
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,100
this yes okay that's okay just bear with

593
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,900
me this is going to be fine now what the

594
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,190
hell are we going here we want to build

595
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,200
a two column layout that stacks and

596
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,230
grows below 480 pixels so below 480

597
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,990
pixels one column above 180 pixels two

598
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,330
columns we cannot use media queries for

599
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,160
this right so how do you make it work

600
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,040
well with this we set we set min with

601
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,700
some 50% max with 100% and we've as a

602
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,400
calque of 480 pixels minus 1% which is

603
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,970
our parent element x 480 why the hell

604
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,890
would you do that right so basically

605
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,720
this is like a two column desktop

606
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,030
version at this point and this is like a

607
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,790
one column mobile version 480 pixels is

608
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,080
our break point and obviously

609
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,090
hundred-percent refers to the parents to

610
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,040
the width of the parent so what are we

611
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,190
doing here our goal is to create a value

612
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,620
bigger than our max with all smaller

613
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,720
than our mean with so instead of with

614
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,850
mean with all max width is going to be

615
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,810
applied

616
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,389
right does it make sense so why does it

617
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:25,399
make sense so here we go let's say we

618
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,950
have again the breakpoint is 480 pixels

619
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,499
so with a parent of 500 pixels you know

620
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:33,019
it's more than 480 pixels right so what

621
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:34,460
do we have here mean width is going to

622
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,340
be 50% which is 250 pixels max width is

623
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,570
than 500 pixels and the width is - 9600

624
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,210
pixels right now at this point minutes

625
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,179
is going to win because if the minutes

626
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:48,590
value is greater than the width or

627
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,739
max-width min which is going to win okay

628
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:55,820
right so the code it is let me see

629
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,859
it's 150 pixels because it's loud it's

630
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:59,629
not larger than max width but it is

631
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:02,299
larger than width so it has to win all

632
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:02,479
right

633
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:03,979
on the other way around if we go below

634
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:07,609
480 pixels so we have let's say 400 here

635
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,529
we've got 200 pixels here we've got

636
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:12,979
former pixels and here we've got 38,400

637
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:15,109
X and fallen pixels and because max

638
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:17,119
width always restricts the width marks

639
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:22,279
which is going to win right and you're

640
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,389
done right and you could say well this

641
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:27,799
is not fancy enough maybe we could do

642
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,419
something else maybe we can use you know

643
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:30,590
JavaScript if javascript is not

644
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,119
supported and the answer is of course

645
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,099
you can right

646
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,809
how can you do this well what if you

647
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:38,389
wanted to build a real-time wall like

648
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:41,450
tweets to tweet a wall in an email when

649
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,799
you send it out can you make it work of

650
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,759
course you can now the question is how

651
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:53,629
external CSS now you can do better than

652
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:53,989
that

653
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:56,419
but that goes in the right direction you

654
00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:00,729
can you deserve one I think anybody else

655
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:04,599
now obviously we can reference an image

656
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,710
which is going to live on the server

657
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,139
which is going to be updated every two

658
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:12,559
seconds and we then are going to crop it

659
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,509
and we're going to animate it a little

660
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:17,419
bit right so it appears as if it was

661
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:19,070
live and it's kind of life just maybe

662
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,519
with a five-second you know delay more

663
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:25,309
or less right and it kind of works right

664
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:27,619
that's pretty cool so that's you know

665
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,139
not a big deal in fact this is what what

666
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:31,759
they did for the email design conference

667
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,100
template and it's actually really

668
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,010
right that's pretty cool in fact if you

669
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,779
really indeed do have to deal with

670
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:40,700
responsive email there are two resources

671
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,260
I highly recommend one is their

672
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,029
responsive email patterns and the other

673
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:46,580
one responsive email resources and this

674
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,700
technique by the way is not for me but

675
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,039
from Remy Parmenter thanks Remy

676
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,649
so that's dirty but it's you know it

677
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:57,860
works alright here's the next one so you

678
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,440
want to add a background to inline text

679
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,760
for headings but the text should be

680
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,140
petted along both the left and right

681
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,390
edge of each line now the left and right

682
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,070
wedding will only apply to the very

683
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,110
first and very last line so if you apply

684
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,940
petting and you have you you know your

685
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,070
text surrounding it some here you've got

686
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,440
your padding right and here you've got

687
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,149
your padding but here you've got no

688
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:18,830
padding and here you've got no painting

689
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:25,260
either right so how would we fix it

690
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,919
sorry negative margin potentially yes

691
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:32,360
but then here you've got double padding

692
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,010
Oh box shadow okay

693
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,190
so what's that then why are you sitting

694
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:44,680
so far

695
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,000
okay I'll try again later all right in

696
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,160
fact we can do this just for you so I

697
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,190
hope it's okay yeah so we can do this by

698
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,570
just using the Bookshare method when we

699
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,130
just put the boxer on both sides and

700
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,080
we're done right so we're kind of

701
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,520
drinking a little bit but it's really

702
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,530
CSE just just adding a boxer on the both

703
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,270
sides and then you don't have really

704
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,010
petty but you kind of looks like you

705
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,780
have painting right well that's pretty

706
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,850
cool and it's really simple now let's go

707
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,430
something go a bit more interesting ways

708
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:23,460
maybe let's see okay I do want to not

709
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:33,620
this one but just a second sorry okay no

710
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,670
so here's the interesting one which is

711
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,890
just really useful in many scenarios so

712
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,750
what if you want to use a full with the

713
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,330
element in a fixed width container right

714
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,070
for example when you want some content

715
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,390
to extend beyond the boundaries of the

716
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,800
container this is what you want

717
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,030
sometimes you want to have like Elias

718
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,650
landing page and you have your container

719
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,570
where the text lives and of course you

720
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,770
want to restrict it because otherwise

721
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,390
the time the line length is going to be

722
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,790
too too big but that image could be kind

723
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,460
of breaking out of that layout right so

724
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,420
how do we do it we W all right well you

725
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,470
can have full screen that's not a

726
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,300
problem the problem is forward that you

727
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,760
actually do want to make sure this kind

728
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,410
of outside but you don't want to close

729
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,840
the first deep open like you know put

730
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,580
the image inside and then reopen the

731
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,180
other div again right so this is what

732
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,030
you of course could do well first of all

733
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,530
you want to restrict your container then

734
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,580
you have your diff and then you have

735
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,470
your piece over the images and so on and

736
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,970
what you will have to do then

737
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,310
potentially it's just close the div and

738
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,990
then reopen open the image and then

739
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,270
close open the deep again right but

740
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,720
that's not nice I mean in fact I mean an

741
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,020
areas that's not difficult right sorry

742
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,610
negative more that's good I like it

743
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,390
keep going okay all right that's okay

744
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,640
all right so in fact negative margins

745
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,220
work quite well here to release our

746
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,170
child element from its container I'm

747
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,330
very proud of the phrasing we need to

748
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,320
know how much

749
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,899
space series between the container and

750
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,610
the viewport edge right and we can

751
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,169
calculate it just by using calc again

752
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:07,049
right how again does it work well we can

753
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:10,710
just use negative V I don't mean here

754
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,929
I've got two margins right basically we

755
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:14,759
are pulling the content out but with

756
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,509
minus 50% with minus 50 VW first and

757
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:20,639
then we put it back with 50% on the

758
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:23,100
parent right of course in the width and

759
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,230
it just works again everywhere so just

760
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,940
we're just pulling it out and then we're

761
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,679
pulling it back with outside of the

762
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,240
scope of container and then kind of back

763
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,759
so it doesn't you know set a good price

764
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:35,220
full screen right and the problem

765
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,070
however is if we do this we end up with

766
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,590
this little bugger right

767
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,960
and so before because this happens we

768
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,789
actually need to also put all four

769
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:47,940
hidden on all four X hidden as well and

770
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,379
then we're really done right so in many

771
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:53,970
scenarios you would be using you know

772
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,129
really closing the diff and then

773
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:57,419
reopening it but you either you really

774
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:58,980
don't have to you can just pull it out

775
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:11,070
and it will work I think there was

776
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,779
something white wouldn't work but it's

777
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,279
my guy I would need to check it out but

778
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,950
it's a good one yeah all right okay

779
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,490
let's see what else let's go something

780
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:33,090
all right this is fun okay this is very

781
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,100
practical so you want to implement how

782
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,580
much time do I have actually oh no time

783
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,620
mm okay then I have to do just one okay

784
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,929
I mean but it's really not a big deal

785
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:46,139
seriously so just last one so happy hour

786
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,669
fun I'm sure you did I mean you'll get

787
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:49,799
all the slides anyway what is the best

788
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,200
way to encode and one times one pixel

789
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,639
would you use JPEG for that would you

790
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:58,769
use a gif for this we do use the PNG

791
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:04,500
what would you use why smaller give it

792
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,350
smaller

793
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,620
is it hmm let's see so that's

794
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,970
interesting some people have nothing to

795
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,110
do on the weekends welcome one times one

796
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,890
pixel give just in case you can't see it

797
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,679
here this kind of waving at you I don't

798
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,840
think that you realize and we could

799
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,130
think well this is not a big deal this

800
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,080
is not that difficult I mean this is not

801
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,520
really like you know it seemed kind of

802
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,390
simple

803
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,270
uncompressed pixel is just one bit right

804
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,299
oh four bytes depends again depends on

805
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:36,980
how we see it so if you look at the

806
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,240
black and white is going to be one bit

807
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,640
grayscale 1 byte grayscale and alpha

808
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,429
channel 2 bytes RGB 3 bytes RGB a 4

809
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:46,280
bytes right that's okay and you could

810
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,179
think well so that's it right this is it

811
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:51,950
well not quite if you want to encode it

812
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,789
using give or leaf or JPEG or whatever

813
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:57,650
and that case you will need to do a bit

814
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,990
more work because as it appears every

815
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,970
image format specifies not only you know

816
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,860
the actual image but also how to

817
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,630
interpret the data and also has some

818
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,580
metadata in it so for example the width

819
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,020
and the height and the number of bits

820
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,240
per bytes of ice per pixel and so on so

821
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,590
if you look specifically into what they

822
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,220
contain

823
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,690
you'll find that there is a magic number

824
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,970
which is like a user agent string in

825
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,070
browsers right it's kind of a fixed

826
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,320
identify which they kind of communicate

827
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,260
whether it's a gif or JPEG or PNG or

828
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,659
anything else it also has some decoding

829
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,400
details like all profiles orientation

830
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,520
gamma dose per pixel has some arbitrary

831
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,409
metadata potentially like things like

832
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,179
time stamps copyright notices or

833
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,520
coordinates and some overhead stuff like

834
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,350
markers and checksums or even pairings

835
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,330
for consistency just to make sure that

836
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,070
whenever the image is transmitted it's

837
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,409
always actually correct in the correct

838
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:47,570
shape and if you look inside you know

839
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,909
into the hex bond dump of it this is

840
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:51,919
what you will find right this is a PNG

841
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,870
this is a few markers even if it's just

842
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,990
you know one x one pixel and they differ

843
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,419
and the different size as well and some

844
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:01,580
people really spend time analyzing this

845
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,880
so this is a gif right and this is

846
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,130
Debbie P and it turns out if you look

847
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,399
into the table and compare what

848
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,619
different pixels have different values

849
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,139
right which is important to know but in

850
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,200
fact this most one is give for white and

851
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,800
everything else too

852
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,020
right and then you could say well this

853
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,730
is not interesting enough what about you

854
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,800
know a color it's like a real color so

855
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,990
if you actually put and go and explore

856
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,330
like there's not just one x one pixel

857
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,100
but let's say ten thousand pixels nine

858
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,690
ten thousand pixels what's going to be

859
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,640
the smallest and the answer is well it

860
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,830
depends of course but in that case the

861
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,440
smallest is going to be PNG which is

862
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,419
interesting by the way the reason why we

863
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:45,060
didn't include jpg and here is because

864
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,919
JP cannot be transparent and it was all

865
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,340
about transparent pixels right all right

866
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,090
well okay so no more time right are you

867
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:59,130
sure oh yes this is brilliant okay so

868
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,650
let's do this so that's what else oh my

869
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,960
god okay this is what this one is really

870
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,350
useful to so baseline ring or vertical

871
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,340
written right

872
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,850
every designer gets on somebody else's

873
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,160
nerves when it comes to basically like

874
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,740
the perfect vertical reading how do you

875
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,450
do it how do you make it right there are

876
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,830
so many great frameworks of course you

877
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,270
could use but do you have to use them

878
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,530
because you can actually make it really

879
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,510
simple now in the answer is one thing

880
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,840
you just have to keep in mind now if I

881
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,940
don't know if you can see oh wow they're

882
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,020
actually supposed to be like a little

883
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,210
grid behind so it depends really on how

884
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,250
you implement it now very often if you

885
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,660
think about the vertical reading you

886
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,730
think about the lines living between the

887
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,710
grid lines right so you have this lines

888
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,410
like the you have agreed and these lines

889
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,540
of text should be sitting right between

890
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,390
them right and they're kind of the same

891
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,220
distance between when they start in

892
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,260
between when the end or you could do it

893
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,240
slightly differently where you just put

894
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,980
the text on that line in the grid and

895
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,450
it's unlikely that you can see it's to

896
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,130
be honest but that's okay I will explain

897
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,950
it anyway so we tend to actually really

898
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,860
most of the time use just a multiple of

899
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,630
line height everywhere

900
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,760
use it for pairings and margins and

901
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,980
sometimes even border width right but we

902
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,140
can align to the by base line instead

903
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,620
right so for this to work we just need

904
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,420
to calculate the offset and then shave

905
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,220
the content by that offset so what does

906
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,020
it mean so let's say we have this lines

907
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,090
right imagine we have lines we have

908
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,180
lines everywhere right here right we

909
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,160
have lines in here everywhere and

910
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,140
here is a line and here is a line and

911
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,839
that line is right where the texts it's

912
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:41,329
all right right here not in here

913
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:44,099
just below it but actually right there

914
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:46,740
which I'm really bad at this right where

915
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,049
it's it's all right in that case this is

916
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:52,470
what we can do so by default how does it

917
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,450
work but default browser center the cap

918
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,339
height as they define it between the

919
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,859
grid lines so the height of the cap

920
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:00,180
height is the height of a capital letter

921
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,549
above the baseline again baseline is

922
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:05,339
where the text sits so we can shift it

923
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,530
by half the difference between line

924
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,730
height and cap height why well because

925
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,740
the tips text sits right between those

926
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,079
lines so if we just take half of that

927
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,150
line for example and we remove the top

928
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,980
of the line height then we actually have

929
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,010
the text sitting right on the base line

930
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,150
okay this didn't go as expected all

931
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,119
right we just need to determine the cap

932
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,339
height and then offset the entire thing

933
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,260
a little bit down and then we have to

934
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,240
pull it back with margin negative margin

935
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,000
at the bottom that's okay just a second

936
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,829
so this is how it's going to work so we

937
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,690
have our line height define power

938
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,010
formstack we could have different

939
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,140
typefaces for example right and we have

940
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,480
different font sizes in the end we're

941
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,250
doing pixels here we're using pixels

942
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,900
here but you can of course transform

943
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,609
them into e/m units later so it's more

944
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:59,220
flexible it just for us to be easier it

945
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,690
kind of to follow easier simpler so we

946
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,099
have the font sizes and then we just

947
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,440
have to kind of refine it with cap

948
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,270
heights a little bit with the formula

949
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,980
you will see in a second so once we

950
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,690
define them we just plugged in a formula

951
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,609
and it works right so how exactly does

952
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:16,470
it work in the end we have this little

953
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,240
sauce mix in where we define the font

954
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,740
size and cap height an offset and

955
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,200
returns that actual offset by again

956
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,369
using that formula which I said before

957
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,770
where we're kind of using the half of

958
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,599
the line height minus cap height times

959
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,390
font size right it will make sense just

960
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,579
don't have time to explain everything

961
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:37,200
right and the only thing we have to do

962
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,000
is kind of put that off so once we

963
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,829
define the offset calculated the offset

964
00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:42,029
we just need to push it a little bit

965
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:45,720
down so it sits right on the baseline in

966
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,560
order to do this

967
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,770
we use we can use this and this is

968
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,000
really like a magic trick

969
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,160
most front-end developers will will

970
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,900
freak out at this point because you can

971
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,330
use margin top and margin bottom and it

972
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,430
could you know weed here you have you

973
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,410
have offset so you're pushing all the

974
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,870
text a little bit down to see it on the

975
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,820
baseline and design it out of you know

976
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,070
not to screw up everything you have to

977
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,080
pull it back with margin bottom for the

978
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,320
for the when the paragraph ends right

979
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,610
for example if you have a set the

980
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,380
paragraphs you want them all to be

981
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,020
sitting right right so what you have to

982
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,300
split back so you still have this

983
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,670
consistence in terms of how the lines

984
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,800
and how they go so once you have this

985
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,960
you might be wondering what the hell is

986
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,030
going on here and you are free to leave

987
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,500
at this point it's like two minutes left

988
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,590
so how does it why does it work because

989
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,550
we have collapsing margins in CSS if you

990
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,740
look into this back in the evening at

991
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,870
night you'll be able to find some really

992
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,910
interesting facts about how it works as

993
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,070
it turns out collapsing margins are not

994
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,260
always collapsing margins so they work

995
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,700
differently with positive and negative

996
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,370
margins you have two positive margins

997
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,890
the bigger one will win and like imagine

998
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,830
you have a margin bottom and you have a

999
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,110
margin top right I mean if you're doing

1000
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,120
CSS you will know this stuff if you have

1001
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,640
two positive values on two consequence

1002
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,980
paragraphs the one with the bigger value

1003
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,720
will win if you have two negative

1004
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,120
margins the lower well I'm the one that

1005
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,400
is more negative is going to win if you

1006
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,140
have one positive and one negative

1007
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,500
they're going to add so the Marches will

1008
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,140
sum up we can abuse it in so many

1009
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,930
different ways right because this is

1010
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,370
exactly what we can do and what we are

1011
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,650
doing here anyway right we have always

1012
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,870
positive one and another one is negative

1013
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,880
and this is exactly what we can use so

1014
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,890
they will be added up and they will

1015
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,390
maintain this vertical written that we

1016
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:41,250
want so what do we have in the end only

1017
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,620
one problem we have only one problem if

1018
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,000
an element doesn't have a border no

1019
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,250
padding and this first child has a

1020
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,770
margin that margin will flow out of the

1021
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,200
parent right because we define the

1022
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,900
negative margin but the actual parent

1023
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,210
has no you know has no padding so it's

1024
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,040
going to flow out so we need to put all

1025
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,130
four hidden on it

1026
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,100
that's okay if you could see the lines

1027
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,380
you will see that all of this text is

1028
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,200
sitting on right on this on the grid

1029
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,480
line without us having to do anything

1030
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,610
without any media queries without

1031
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,530
anything just works using a little bit

1032
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,350
of you know cook calc is like magic it's

1033
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,580
like you know flexbox

1034
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,550
calc and you don't that's all you need

1035
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,040
to know what CSS person seriously if you

1036
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,240
want to learn more about this and just

1037
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,000
use the mixin here we go right

1038
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,970
implementing baseline reading in CSS

1039
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,220
doesn't take much time at all so this in

1040
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,090
mind I'm very sorry I have to give away

1041
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,820
some chocolates just just because you

1042
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,410
okay who is really desperate in

1043
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,080
desperately needs chocolate now oh these

1044
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,660
people all right these people they want

1045
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,790
chocolate all right okay sorry

1046
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:55,720
so I'm taking up the time that was

1047
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,040
really bad I'm sorry

1048
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,330
all right so you can just pick it up

1049
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,550
later that's easy all right so I've got

1050
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,430
like the the slide deck is public

1051
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,040
it's already on slide deck so you can

1052
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,750
download it and with that in mind thank

1053
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,310
you and if you want to talk more about

1054
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,590
dirty stuff and CSS and not necessarily

1055
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,810
say such a dirty just come to me and
