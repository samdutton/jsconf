1
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:21,020

where r sub R a game dev for web

2
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,240
designers hmm so we're dead for you may

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,140
call me better or better as they call me

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,900
in Brazil or with her if you're an

5
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,120
English speaker whatever man my name is

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,800
weird and hard so you may call me

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,880
anywhere anything you want I think it's

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,770
good to understand where I'm coming from

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,440
I worked as a web designer for six years

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,570
and then I got into the gaming industry

11
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,140
and worked there for another six years

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,820
so that's where my experience comes I

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,270
also teach classes at a university in

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,700
Brazil I also teach all your classes and

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,210
web technology classes so when I hope

16
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,270
that I can get my experience to join

17
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,790
these both worlds here today and I'm

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,909
also a music composer so I do a lot of

19
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:18,350
stuff these days after I've been working

20
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,679
for four years in a company called nano

21
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:25,789
studio which was a small but like 15

22
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:28,670
people can company in Rio I became an

23
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,999
indie game developer so this is me in my

24
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:34,189
partner eager and we are mini pixel we

25
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,630
are small indie game developer and we

26
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,759
are we've been working in this game

27
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,249
called warlocks tower warlock star it's

28
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:46,249
a puzzle game it's been awarded in two

29
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:48,350
categories in Brazil so we've been very

30
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,679
glad about that and we've been dedicated

31
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:55,310
full time to warlocks tower but where

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,219
else i will come later now i want to

33
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,280
speak a little disclaimer here i will be

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,619
talking about to the games okay because

35
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:05,509
if you really want to become a

36
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:08,479
professional game developer working on

37
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,520
tripod games like GTA or Skyrim and

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,270
these kinds of games well the web isn't

39
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,360
ready yet WebGL is great it's cool but

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,909
you can make Skyrim to run on a browser

41
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,849
yet we'll eventually get there so if you

42
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,340
want to do this now do yourself a favor

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,670
and

44
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,390
go learn C++ or C sharp and play with

45
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,670
unity and all these kind of kinds of

46
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,760
engines but I had my background as i

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,520
told you is as a web designer so I'm

48
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,700
taking a different route here so don't

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,220
four games I'm so glad that I'm speaking

50
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,620
after Rachel because she have shown you

51
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,650
how amazing the dome can be so it's

52
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,630
pretty it's a little bit easier for me

53
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,959
to get my point across so you may ask me

54
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,010
really come on WebGL is far better

55
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,620
canvas is far better why on earth would

56
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,480
you use the dome for games well first of

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,170
all this is not a new idea back in 2005

58
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,620
when people called website animations d

59
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,269
HTML who was there back man only a few

60
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:23,690
of you yeah this guy was already making

61
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,819
cool games at the time when browser

62
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,660
browsers weren't that fast so in 2009

63
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,150
another guy called Trevor collie he made

64
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,930
an engine called GMP which is largely

65
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,600
based off jQuery it has a similar API

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,000
and all the objects that you're seeing

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,730
here our dome objects are Dom node so

68
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,680
plenty of dips in short and then in 2010

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,590
these other guys selling our server I

70
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,840
hope I'm getting his name right he came

71
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,010
with game query who gets the gas we

72
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,090
changing it's based off right so but all

73
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,630
these engines these pioneering engines

74
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,820
of which i'm sure most of you haven't

75
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,989
heard about have one problem back then

76
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:17,419
the work kind of slow because all we

77
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:19,519
have to make animations back then were a

78
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,340
set time out and set interval and today

79
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,010
we know that these methods aren't they

80
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,930
were never fast and they are not fast

81
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,300
today even though they're faster but

82
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,350
they can't cut it and the standard

83
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,450
against which we compared everything

84
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,510
back then was our good old friend flesh

85
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,150
so everyone who was playing on the web

86
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,110
or making

87
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,020
further for the web were making on flash

88
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,870
because flesh may be a lot of things but

89
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,110
it wasn't slow back then it was a pretty

90
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,390
fast engine for for the browser it was

91
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,850
the best thing we had so in 2010 you all

92
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,340
know what happened right Steve Jobs

93
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,280
killed flash all together which is a

94
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,070
good thing for us right oui oui people

95
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,290
that like web standards so from then on

96
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,630
HTML game engines flourished there is a

97
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,750
lot of HTML game engines these days you

98
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,260
may have heard of some of them but most

99
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,930
of them are canvas engines people don't

100
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,640
don't care about the dawn they are

101
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,780
canvas they are WebGL most of them don't

102
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,890
don't contemplate the dumb as a

103
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,670
rendering target most but these these

104
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,740
for example they do present an

105
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,140
alternative so you can switch a

106
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,810
rendering target and render to done so

107
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,700
you may think that you're getting what

108
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,250
I'm talking right Oh game dev by web

109
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,740
designer so you'll just develop your

110
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,410
game on a traditional gaming engine and

111
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,480
then switch the target and that's it

112
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,990
that's dumb game development well not

113
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,580
exactly my idea is a little different

114
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,550
because there's a small problem game dev

115
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,640
is totally unlike front end dev it's a

116
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,120
totally different way of thinking and

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,830
I'm not a professional developer by all

118
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,680
means I've been noise a designer or an

119
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,980
artist or a musician so for me to think

120
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,470
in terms of game development was always

121
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,250
pretty hard and why is that let's take a

122
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,530
look at our classic fronting approach

123
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,980
that we all love which is with throw

124
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,860
content at our HTML and we see this

125
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,190
content we visually format it via CSS

126
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,010
these days we have auto refresh but back

127
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,560
then we will go at five ffff over some

128
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,570
of you are who I bet are still doing

129
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,970
this so the thing is while we are f5 in

130
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,009
our browsers we're

131
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,499
what we're working on we don't have to

132
00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:01,249
abstract it in our minds and then after

133
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:03,229
everything is laid out we'll make it

134
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:06,050
come alive with JavaScript so how many

135
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,759
of you use this workflow here nope okay

136
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,589
some of you this is called in computer

137
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:18,050
graphics we call this the retain mode

138
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,379
the retain mode is when you don't have

139
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:24,979
to worry about the drawing loop the

140
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,499
things they are being draw draw on

141
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:33,620
screen so the classic game game dev

142
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,839
approach on the other side is a little

143
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,849
different you have a game loop that

144
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:40,759
takes like a clock and at each tick of

145
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,710
this clock you make lots of

146
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,169
verifications like victory conditions

147
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:49,309
States collisions or except at each tick

148
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,529
of the clock you're verifying this but

149
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,330
because there's no other way to develop

150
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,589
games and verify if your if your player

151
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:00,589
is colliding verify player input so if

152
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:02,659
you're making games that are heavily

153
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,539
reliant on player reflexes that's the

154
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:07,939
way we should develop games this is

155
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:09,709
called immediate mode when you have

156
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,709
control over your drawing loop you have

157
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:15,469
control over each and every frame that

158
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:19,249
goes into the screen this is your right

159
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,159
approach the right way however and

160
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:25,580
however no no not however it is faster

161
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,529
it is more efficient and it's more

162
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:30,080
flexible so you have full control over

163
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,260
your game so it is the right way if any

164
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,479
of you want to be a professional game

165
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,360
developer this is the way you should go

166
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,519
this is the way you should learn this is

167
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,610
the way games are made to be honest

168
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,769
however if you're like me you will find

169
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:48,010
it that it's also more complex more

170
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,690
abstract as I told you before you have

171
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,899
to think beforehand before you get to

172
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,000
see things happening on screen you have

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,889
to program a lot it's less friendly for

174
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,779
visual thinkers because of this very

175
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,810
reason I find it to be so and it's a

176
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,780
completely different way of coding so

177
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,770
if you use to coding websites and you ok

178
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,410
now I'm going to run phaser it's a

179
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,300
completely way of cording you have to

180
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,210
relearn everything you know and in my

181
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,430
life I have procrastinated a lot of

182
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,430
times I started learning a game engine

183
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,340
and I haven't gone to the end because I

184
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,190
found two different I I didn't have time

185
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,750
back then so in 2014 I read this book

186
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,910
jquery the game developed many

187
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,920
essentials and this book is all about

188
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,670
making games with the dawn after that I

189
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,010
made these games which happened to be

190
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,010
client works these are simple games but

191
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,360
they were made with DOM and I was

192
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,330
amazing bleh I was like man I can make

193
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,520
games I can finally make games and

194
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,280
what's best i can make games exactly

195
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,000
like i make websites so what i really

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,400
mean by game dev for web designers is

197
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,890
not take a traditional engine switch

198
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,900
you're arranging target and you're set

199
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,060
no I want you to I want you to see the

200
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,940
beauty of developing games by using HTML

201
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,590
CSS and JavaScript and to convince you I

202
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,730
made a proof of concept here which is

203
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,560
our game warlocks tower I made a

204
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,870
simplified version of warlocks hour

205
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,500
which is running on the dawn and i will

206
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,890
show you right now let me put this here

207
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:49,760
so i can use my mouth okay so this is

208
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,340
warlocks tower as you can see the

209
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,340
inspector is open so if i put my mouse

210
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,430
here well walls are let me explain to

211
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,550
you play as mailman team which is this

212
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,990
guy here and he must take as i told you

213
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,360
this is a version of a larger game which

214
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,540
was developing lure in this game you

215
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,250
play as mailman team and you have to

216
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,500
take a ladder to the evil warlock who

217
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,550
lives on the top of the tower however

218
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,149
the tower is cursed so at each step you

219
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:29,790
take you lose one life okay so if I

220
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:35,529
screw up I die these controls are for

221
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,250
mobile use so if you wish to access the

222
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,160
URL later you can try it it's mostly

223
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,029
working on Chrome mobile chrome and I

224
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,610
think I follow as well but it's a little

225
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,980
worried and I would explain why but

226
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,910
let's stick to it if you can see where

227
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,860
if I expect here Tim himself is a div so

228
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,240
he's here okay and there is JavaScript

229
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,630
animation going on well he walks and oh

230
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,910
I forgot to tell you there are three

231
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,730
live gems in five live gems so the

232
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,740
puzzle is that I must get to the exit

233
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,440
that I conveniently painted blue for you

234
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,880
and by taking the gems so if we had time

235
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,160
I would ask one of you to come here and

236
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,720
play because I love to see people

237
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,060
playing it were lost our however I'll

238
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,120
just play for you so you saw me dying

239
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,940
already well die again and the idea in

240
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,670
this level is that I have to pick I

241
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,339
don't need this gem I'd have to pick

242
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:45,700
this one this one and then go straight

243
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:53,550
to the exit okay my main idea here

244
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,860
besides proving to you that I can take

245
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,970
our commercial product which is a

246
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,529
award-winning product that will take to

247
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:04,360
the market in two or three months and

248
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,860
make with HTML and CSS I also wanted to

249
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,350
make a proof of concept of something I

250
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,870
find very interesting which is using

251
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,800
HTML as a level design too ok if you use

252
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,949
a live server as I'm doing here a node

253
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:24,519
live server and I most of you how many

254
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,790
of you are using life service these days

255
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,310
most of you the ones who aren't should

256
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,740
because it makes her life really easier

257
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,350
so if you're using a live server

258
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,040
i coded it so as to make the level

259
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,650
design process as streamlined as I could

260
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,680
so all we have to do I'm using tables

261
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,530
here not because I think that you see

262
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,470
the tables for your website because it's

263
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,410
a grid-based game so i found it i found

264
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,230
the tables to be more intuitive as a

265
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,500
level design tool in this case instead

266
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,720
of using just dips with classes or

267
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,060
section and a div inside a section or an

268
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,480
article i just use a table here so if i

269
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,850
want to create a new event here i will

270
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,690
create for example a number three Jen

271
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,290
here in the last column okay then I'll

272
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,650
just put the question 3 and when it

273
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,560
refreshes here's my jam so I can make my

274
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,350
level in real time by using good and old

275
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,310
HTML I can make it pretty fast I'm used

276
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,590
to making levels using a level editor

277
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,250
called tiled and I wanted to reproduce

278
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,860
this workflow as good as I could with

279
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,830
HTML I took this idea from the the

280
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,710
system i usually used to author my

281
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,380
slides when i teach classes which is

282
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,690
revealed Jas and after some years of

283
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,840
using reveal Jas I was amazed of how

284
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,110
fast I could work authoring with HTML

285
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,720
and I bet you also can author pretty

286
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,200
fast with HML so of course I won't be

287
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,090
making a fool ever here because you have

288
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,870
to think for that but you can see that I

289
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,600
have the main events here that allow me

290
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,640
to make a warlock star level which are

291
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,090
the three jam the five gem and the whole

292
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,390
with that you can make a lot of levels I

293
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,810
also implemented a quick level oder so i

294
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,300
can switch levels here and load on

295
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:30,060
another level so i could for instance

296
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,350
die and well here's the first level

297
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,560
again as i told you this is a prototype

298
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,750
it's a prototype i made just for this

299
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,940
talk then of course there are some

300
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,670
quirks here and there but it's totally

301
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,190
playable and it's so the levels are

302
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,059
totally do

303
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,459
there's a levels folder and if you

304
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:54,009
create a new HTML for it will appear

305
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:55,899
here on the list for you to load and

306
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:58,839
you've gotten yourself a new level so if

307
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,939
you want to experiment with it I will

308
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,039
make it available through github and

309
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,439
cold pan later and you can design your

310
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:14,529
own warlocks tower levels so my main

311
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:17,589
takeaways here one of one of which i

312
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:20,499
have talked a lot about is that HTML is

313
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:23,649
a great level design to not only because

314
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,429
we're used to it but because our IDEs

315
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:28,659
autocomplete a lot of stuff so we can

316
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,749
work really fast with it and if you want

317
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:35,679
prefer to use a preprocessor like a

318
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,719
hammer or such an elegant language you

319
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:44,979
probably work even faster I've used a

320
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:48,099
lot of CSS pseudo elements so to create

321
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:51,219
the gems to create the holes the events

322
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:55,089
and to make the the lab the level design

323
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:57,999
process as straightforward as I could so

324
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:01,119
my main objective was I just add classes

325
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:04,299
and stuff will happen so I use a lot of

326
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:06,610
pseudo elements for that of course I use

327
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,279
CSS animations for the gems and a cool

328
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,230
thing about using CSS animations for

329
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,019
that is that you can specify different

330
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:17,439
animation timings which in normal game

331
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,600
engines it's kind of a pain to make

332
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,299
stuff happen at different rates so by

333
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:24,999
using CSS for our animations for the

334
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:27,009
static objects like the gems the gym

335
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:28,990
doesn't have to move around they are

336
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,480
there and they are just a sprite sprite

337
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,710
sheet being played through CSS with the

338
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:40,299
steps function so it's pretty CSS is an

339
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,730
amazing tool and CSS is also great if

340
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,519
you're like we are a developer working

341
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,169
on the game logic and you have a

342
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:49,840
designer or artists working on the

343
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,899
visual side you can parallel eyes the

344
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:56,649
work pretty pretty easily with CSS your

345
00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:58,539
designer may make just like we do on

346
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,429
websites right that your designer may

347
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:01,170
make

348
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,040
new level themes new spreadsheets new

349
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,710
monsters and may test all of it just by

350
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,290
using CSS he doesn't have to get his

351
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,420
hands dirty with JavaScript if he

352
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,330
doesn't why doesn't want it jquery is

353
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,030
too very handy for this kind of stuff

354
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,990
because when you're working with with an

355
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,420
engine where everything our downloads

356
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,630
there are jquery is a very good tool to

357
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,050
query the dome as you may know and it

358
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,720
returns you the jquery object with which

359
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,360
already comes with a lot of information

360
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,320
that you can use for for your game so it

361
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,750
is still a handy tool for this uses but

362
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,720
you can still go vanilla JavaScript no

363
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,230
problem with that and and do the same

364
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,840
another thing I use I use a lot is image

365
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,600
rendering pixelated which is a fairly

366
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,820
recent CSS rule and it's not supported

367
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,440
in all major browsers yet for instance i

368
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,350
founded that on mobile iOS the game is

369
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,050
too blurry because the idea will be

370
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,570
image rendering pixelated because this

371
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,270
kind of image rendering mode uses the

372
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,790
nearest neighbourhood algorithm which is

373
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,590
the algorithm you need to scale your

374
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,490
pixel art and pixel art is it is always

375
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,770
a good fit for the web because it's

376
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,480
small i'm using 16 by 16 sprites so it's

377
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,960
ultra fast my CSS files my javascript

378
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,630
files are probably larger than my images

379
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,490
and and they scale well it so if you're

380
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,760
using a preprocessor like less or says

381
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,280
you can just create a variable with a

382
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,280
scale factor and then just scale the

383
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,160
screen and because of the nearest

384
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,250
neighbor already algorithm if you scale

385
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,340
the screen it will adjust pretty well so

386
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,960
you can write some media queries and

387
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,690
scale the screen according to your

388
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,760
resolutions so these are the takeaways

389
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,600
and I wanted to talk about what's

390
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,580
different now because I told you that

391
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,090
back then those pioneering

392
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,140
engines were slow right so these days as

393
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,540
we know browser Jas engines are way

394
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,420
faster because the vendors are trying to

395
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,270
provide a native life experience these

396
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,580
days we also have a request animation

397
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,040
frame we don't have to rely we also have

398
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,250
of course at all the school high-tech

399
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,070
stuff that rachel has shown you so you

400
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,380
won't need even to rely on request

401
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,630
animation frame in the future then of

402
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,270
course we have optimized libraries like

403
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,080
gzip and velocity that take care of all

404
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,330
the optimization you need with repaints

405
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,550
and reflows that is the major

406
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,860
performance bottleneck when you're

407
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,350
trying to manipulate the Dom and move

408
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,890
things to the dome however since I'm

409
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,820
using CSS animations as well the most of

410
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,860
the animations the static animations get

411
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,550
uploaded to the GPU anyway so using gzip

412
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,970
in combination is a good choice until we

413
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,330
start using the web animations API and

414
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,570
one thing that we never had and as a

415
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,940
musician I was always really sad about

416
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,120
that it's cross-browser audio support so

417
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,030
now we have that through the audio

418
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,130
element which is a little quirky and of

419
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,680
course through the Web Audio API the Web

420
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,890
Audio API is amazing it provides a lot

421
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,110
of possibilities for games like spatial

422
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,790
audio and dynamic audio and we are

423
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,650
really close to having it supported

424
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:52,050
widespread so another thing if I have

425
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,810
time do I have time ok I wanted to talk

426
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,680
about is the types of games that we can

427
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,860
make is that of course we can make we

428
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,560
cannot make every type of game by using

429
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,150
the dawn but we can make fairly a fairly

430
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,150
good quantity of genres such as of

431
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,730
course rapid prototyping genre is not a

432
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,160
joiner I start with it with it because i

433
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,100
find that HTML and CSS and javascript

434
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,260
are really good for rapid prototyping

435
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,240
you can just throw your code there and

436
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,030
test game ideas because in traditional

437
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,470
game design

438
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,419
we usually test our ideas with pen and

439
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,210
paper will test our ideas with board

440
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,549
games if you study in a game design

441
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:38,039
class and you problem your teacher will

442
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,280
probably take you one step back and tell

443
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,230
you to design board games to test your

444
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,690
rule set so we can take one step further

445
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,210
from that then test our rule set by

446
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,230
using an HTML Javascript and CSS you can

447
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,850
make digital card games you can make

448
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,720
digital board games you could make

449
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,299
management simulators and this one which

450
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,289
is game dev tycoon and was made by using

451
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:06,299
web technologies and it's a great game

452
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,549
it's an awesome game if I haven't played

453
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:11,940
you should strategy RPGs like

454
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,490
TextExpander Fantasy Tactics vandal

455
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,190
hearts Fire Emblem this kind of kinds of

456
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,320
games are easy to easy easily doable

457
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,210
they are pretty similar to what I've

458
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,429
shown you in war all-star of course a

459
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:25,679
point-and-click adventure games are

460
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,470
totally but doable with Dom puzzles of

461
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,070
course as I have proven you and most

462
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,890
turn based games can be achieved by

463
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,610
using John technologies okay if you rely

464
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,909
on the player taking actions

465
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:44,669
turn-by-turn if you don't rely on a game

466
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:47,669
clock on very fun events at each tick of

467
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:50,100
a clock you can make it by using the Dom

468
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,830
you just react to play events and you

469
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,270
react to the terms there are some jurors

470
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,860
however that you shouldn't even try

471
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,010
because these are the games based off

472
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,620
reflexes that i told you about where you

473
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,510
have to make lots of verifications and

474
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,809
you couldn't you it would be quickly

475
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:12,090
drain by callback hell by using the DOM

476
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,400
and you probably wouldn't have a

477
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,750
performance anyway so action platformers

478
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,830
first-person shooters shoot em ups

479
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,260
fighting games anything with frantic

480
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,030
gameplay lots of sprites collisions

481
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,270
real-time events for that stick to

482
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,400
traditional engines you don't have to

483
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,919
get out of the web you may use for

484
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,270
instance craft tjs which is a pretty

485
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,080
easy engine to use you may use phaser

486
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,700
you may also use construct

487
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,370
which is a technology in which you make

488
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,029
games by pointing and clicking so if you

489
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,980
don't want to call whatsoever if you're

490
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,769
getting home tired from a day of code in

491
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:54,679
JavaScript and you just want to play

492
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,980
constructed nice tool and it's all it

493
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,039
renders to WebGL so it's also web based

494
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,539
rendering wise and the last thing I want

495
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,779
I want to say is of course i know i'm

496
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:11,519
talking about the heck here and i hope

497
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,200
you also know i'm talking about a hack

498
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,860
the dome were was made for you I for

499
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,740
using interfaces for content heavy stuff

500
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,039
it wasn't made for her game so I'm aware

501
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,130
that I'm advocating here for a heck but

502
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,000
it's a good heck it's a hack that will I

503
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,309
hope hopefully will will encourage you

504
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,710
who already have this skill set who

505
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,409
already know how to code website to code

506
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,019
games i wish i can open your mind to how

507
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:43,169
many games you could be doing so don't

508
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:46,950
procrastinate don't wait for the day

509
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,710
when you finally learn phaser or unity

510
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,580
or unreal engine just start making your

511
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,289
games with what you know i think that's

512
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:02,130
it you can reach me at better at midi

513
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,130
pixel com I'm w mythical pixel at

514
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,590
Twitter and you should definitely check

515
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,779
out the original warlocks are we have a

516
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:13,710
built for pc mac and linux and we have

517
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,080
already in this build and this demo

518
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,100
build which is free of course we have

519
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,990
30-something levels and i hope you can

520
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,299
play it and enjoy it and hopefully

521
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,850
provide me with feedback so i can make

522
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,530
the game better so gracias
