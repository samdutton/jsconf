I'm Nathan Riley and I live in the san

2
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,090
francisco bay area have been for

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,340
all my life pretty much and i work at

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,950
automatic wordpress com also known as

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,970
and i've been there for about a year i

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,290
came over with the cloud up acquisition

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,550
with ki jaya or ouch and i primarily do

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,040
javascript over there you know we were

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,900
working on a new editor experience for

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,280
for making blog posts and they they're

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,540
relying on us to make that experience

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,110
happen so I've been doing JavaScript for

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,510
at least five years i would say i would

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,710
i would consider myself pretty

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,070
proficient in it primarily all of my

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,800
development work is in javascript or at

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,790
least something that compiles to

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,280
JavaScript for HTML and CSS which are

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,640
related but it's definitely my my

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,030
primary language so specifically we're

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,460
working on building the new editor

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,509
experience making blog posts and having

23
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:12,670
a really nice clean interface for

24
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,430
including embeds and you know youtube

25
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,039
things like that and also bringing over

26
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,690
some clawed up influences to the editor

27
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,789
as well like the drag and dropping of

28
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,560
files on the web browser and having them

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,319
being included in the post that way well

30
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,979
I mean it's touching wordpress com so

31
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,750
that's like a pretty big chunk of the

32
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,729
internet right I mean I mean WordPress

33
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,649
itself is like 20 over twenty percent of

34
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:38,380
the internet and wordpress com hold

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,289
holds a good chunk of that as well so

36
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,910
it's gonna be going into the hands of

37
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,800
you know millions of users right out

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,630
right off the gate so that I mean for me

39
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,360
that's nerve-racking but also exciting

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,640
and JavaScript because didn't be around

41
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,440
for a while web browsers have proved

42
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,050
that to us and the web browser is the

43
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,640
you know the primary platform of choice

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,800
these days so that's you know that's

45
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,259
javascript is really early option other

46
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:04,060
than these new you know compiled two

47
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,920
languages that you know are ultimately

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,290
just JavaScript in the end

49
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,090
well it's my third time here in

50
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,220
beautiful bunny series and I just can't

51
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,690
get enough of it every time you see mo

52
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,660
says we're coming back in like 20 hour

53
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,890
flight I'm there this is the most

54
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,720
beautiful javascript conference I've

55
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,730
ever been to hands down the designers

56
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,100
are off the chain I love all the pixel

57
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,430
art and the art work and I mean really

58
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,280
the production value is incredible live

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,190
