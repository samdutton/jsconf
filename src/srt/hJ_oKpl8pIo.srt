[Music]

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,080
hi I'm flaky I'm I'm a missile attack

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,279
speaker and I'm JavaScript developer and

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,230
do a bunch of other stuff and do a lot

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,930
open source stuff and some of the open

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,090
source stuff on different missile in

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,890
most developments

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,859
I do not develop anything that aren't

9
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,960
gonna be talking about bad but I think

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,780
it's super important to talk about this

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,980
so who is Mozilla right missile is this

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,120
cooperation that everybody knows about

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,340
their foxes and browsers maybe like

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,920
Mozilla Firefox but it's actually a

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,170
champion of the open Internet and you

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,890
know there is a thing about the Internet

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,800
80% of probably all Internet traffic is

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,160
video and the problem with video is that

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,660
it needs a lot of data to transfer

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,170
moving pictures of kittens over if you

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,290
don't want to do it over compiling those

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,930
two gifs or gifts shoot me so Mozilla

23
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,760
figured that they they wanted to make

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,369
sure that there's image compilations

25
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,799
work out faster than usual and work with

26
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,070
a better compression ratio so the digit

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,659
started videos they actually started

28
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,600
with audio has anybody heard of opus

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,939
here there I go

30
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,759
yeah exactly so you probably had an mp3

31
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,740
player and now we are super happy

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,650
because MPV is the patient's and mp3

33
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,200
codecs which is an audio codec has

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,020
already expired but that wasn't the case

35
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,479
so you couldn't really use the mp3

36
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,060
encoding and decoding freely and so

37
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,229
missile have figured out hey we are

38
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,329
gonna do like an audio codec that you

39
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,700
can just use freely and it kind of

40
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,310
worked so they were like hey why don't

41
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,170
we just do this for video as well so

42
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,390
they started working on dala which is

43
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,180
the super amazing video technology but

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,670
they couldn't pull it off alone so what

45
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,340
they did is actually onboard and a bunch

46
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,380
of other vendors

47
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,040
created a vivan a v1 is actually by

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,770
alliance of open media and it's a

49
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,930
shortening of alliance of open media

50
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,430
video 1 and it's a open and royalty free

51
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,760
open-source codec for video and coding

52
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,510
and video transfer so the good things

53
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,110
about its royalty-free inverse you know

54
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,220
for hav C or h.264 or all the other

55
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,830
videos that are currently dominating and

56
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,530
the internet vendors have to pay like

57
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,370
hundreds of million dollars to be able

58
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,739
to use that this is completely free to

59
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,860
use and it actually achieves better

60
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,350
compression ratio that state-of-the-art

61
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,950
codecs can if you have been watching the

62
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,190
news

63
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,739
Apple has just announced that they're

64
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,690
going to be supporting HEV C which is

65
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,310
like the newest generation of video

66
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,049
encoding this AV one actually has a

67
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,489
potential to go 30% below this size of

68
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,600
the equivalent HEV C codec it has a

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,850
bunch of other things to it it also has

70
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,209
a bunch of drawbacks so the one of the

71
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,340
reasons that you have probably not heard

72
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,840
of it it's because it has been a

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,010
research project for a long time and

74
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,049
this the bit same has just finalized

75
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,280
that means you're going to be seeing

76
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,120
this pop up in browsers and other places

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,989
more and more

78
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,239
what are these places in the first place

79
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,579
Wow there's a lot that's that's a lot of

80
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,250
that's a big vendor list the big thing

81
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,120
about this is video and your internet to

82
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,400
pull this off actually you need adoption

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,620
actually a lot of the browser vendors

84
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,989
that you consider important including

85
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,870
Apple are onboard in this actually

86
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,500
Google has contributed their vp9 codec

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,950
and they merged it into the code base so

88
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,350
Google is also in there Netflix is

89
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,919
planning to push video content out as we

90
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,750
speak so you expect

91
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,080
do you have it in content providers as

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,160
well and Mozilla already has this in

93
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,560
Firefox nightly you can try this out

94
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,270
missile also built a bunch of open

95
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,120
source tools to work on this project and

96
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,580
to pull this huge project off so if you

97
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,190
want to learn more you should probably

98
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,070
figure it out and search for a b-1 and a

99
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,160
om thank you

100
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,410
[Applause]
