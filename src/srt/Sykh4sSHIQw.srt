1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,250

okay hi good working Mike yes cool okay

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,099
so hi my name is Dan I'm gonna talk

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,580
about javascript in space well I got all

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,710
right so uh yeah twitter handles d

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,939
harden if you want to follow me for bad

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,269
tweets I got him so space like I really

7
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,070
like space I get really geeked out about

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,109
it so if I get all like giggly during

9
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,550
this talk it's because I think space is

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,160
so cool but I'm not really smart enough

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,780
to be like a rocket scientist or like an

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,260
astronaut or something so like if you're

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,730
interested in space and you want to like

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,649
learn about like what can you do like

15
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,350
what can just like whoever do so one day

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,510
at work we were having a hackathon who's

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,789
ever done a hackathon yeah lots of

18
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,010
people holy crap ok so there's usually

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,719
like a theme like oh we're gonna like

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,329
work on you know something with like AWS

21
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,890
so we're gonna like solve this problem

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,229
they didn't set a theme to this one so

23
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:05,400
we were like alright man we're gonna

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,560
like do a weather balloon and we're

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,880
going to take this weather balloon and

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,920
we're going to get it like super high in

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,299
the air as high as we can get and we're

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,530
going to take a picture the earth and

29
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,520
it's going to be awesome spoilers it

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,979
didn't quite go that way but it was

31
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,430
still pretty good so the deal is you

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,049
could just get a weather balloon and

33
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,549
they can go up to like a hundred

34
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,860
thousand feet easy which isn't

35
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,689
technically space but for the purposes

36
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,200
of this talk it's space okay alright

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,270
cool so we just needed to get this thing

38
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,400
up there but more importantly we need to

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,380
get it back so there's a variety of

40
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,780
problems with that like number one okay

41
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,130
we can strap it to the balloon that's

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,100
that's probably fine but like can you

43
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,570
drop a GoPro from like a hundred

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,509
thousand feet and it's okay maybe I

45
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,729
don't know and then once you've done

46
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,979
that like how do you figure out where

47
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,979
the hell the thing went you can't really

48
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,360
see a balloon that's a hundred thousand

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,610
feet in the air we tried so here was a

50
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,080
kind of a step-by-step process of what

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,319
we were working on we found a box and we

52
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,959
hole in it and shut up we just like okay

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,480
so we've got a box we got a GoPro we

54
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,700
have a scale let's just try and figure

55
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,409
this thing out so we kind of went on

56
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,689
amazon prime i was a three-day hackathon

57
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,549
so we kind of had like a day for the

58
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,489
idea a day to like order the things and

59
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,200
then like a day to actually do the thing

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,209
so we were we were super super pressed

61
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,090
for time so someone kindly donated a

62
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,030
GoPro that was like almost certain to be

63
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,150
destroyed so good for them we bought a

64
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,680
parachute we bought a weather balloon

65
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,060
they're like twenty bucks it's kind of

66
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,250
surprising how cheap they are we bought

67
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,139
some like paracord and then we're like

68
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,340
okay well just lap all these things

69
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,090
together and it'll totally work we had

70
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,790
to do like math which I'm not very good

71
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,699
at but with you know whatever turns out

72
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,530
the really tricky part with making a

73
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,680
balloon is like there's websites like

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,419
hab hub is a really good website you can

75
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,099
figure out like here's my payload and

76
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,049
then like if I put this much helium in

77
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:14,400
the balloon it's going to go up this

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,469
fast and then like the prevailing wind

79
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:18,349
conditions and blah blah below my god

80
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:20,220
you just want to figure out where the

81
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,840
balloons going to go and they go for a

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,599
really really long time so we kind of

83
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,509
did our best to figure it out so we live

84
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,250
in Las Vegas which is in the middle of

85
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,900
the Mojave Desert so there's a lot of

86
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,819
nothing which is good if you want to

87
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,349
like launch a balloon and not land it in

88
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,569
like somebody's yard which was kind of

89
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,780
what we're trying to avoid so we kind of

90
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,569
got everything together we did a little

91
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,189
research on how we were going to track

92
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:47,489
it and we came up with kind of a kind of

93
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,259
sort of compromise solution so like I

94
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:50,699
said we only had a couple days to do

95
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,939
this in four teams that do this

96
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,310
regularly or professionally they use a

97
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,819
standard called a PRS spoilers this is

98
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,239
going to come up later it's a actually

99
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,479
an amateur radio thing that you can use

100
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,799
to track the balloon it sends out

101
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,120
packets that say hey I'm here I'm here

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
I'm here we didn't have time to do that

103
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,989
because you need to actually have a ham

104
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,169
radio license they even use it so what

105
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:17,310
we did was we bought something called a

106
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,829
spot GPS it's used for like climbers if

107
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,150
they're you know lost on a mountain

108
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,409
somewhere they can push the button it'll

109
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,889
tell you where you are the spot GPS was

110
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:27,220
like two hundred dollars

111
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,720
something and we figured like we could

112
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
probably return it as long as it didn't

113
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,830
like plummet to the ground and explode

114
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,110
so we're making a lot of assumptions

115
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,650
here about like will the parachute work

116
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,820
so here's our completed spacecraft

117
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,390
spacecraft because it's going to space

118
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,740
we painted it pink so it would be really

119
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,440
easy to see we put a nice note on it

120
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,180
that said hey this isn't a bomb it's

121
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,640
like a science experiment we just wanted

122
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,320
it to be really friendly looking because

123
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,910
if it did land in someone's yard we

124
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,390
didn't want like the cops get called

125
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,970
here's a very scientific diagram of how

126
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,570
it works the gist of it is it's

127
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,550
incredibly not complex we have a box

128
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,580
with some stuff in it like a GoPro we've

129
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,410
got a line going up to a parachute and

130
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,960
that gets attached to the balloon so as

131
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,030
the balloon Rises in the air the air

132
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,410
pressure drops the balloon gets bigger

133
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,360
and bigger and bigger at some point the

134
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,090
balloon pops that's kind of your really

135
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,680
limiting factor as the balloon gets too

136
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,740
big and pops so the idea was this

137
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,840
balloon would go up it would pop it

138
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,460
would fall and then the parachute would

139
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,140
just happily open up and then everything

140
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,500
would be perfect for ever and it was our

141
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,560
initial process just like impossible to

142
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,710
just all right to the ground it didn't

143
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,560
work at all we tried like maybe maybe

144
00:05:47,560 --> 00:06:02,860
for like a second it was nighttime you

145
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,140
know we did her best so it wasn't like

146
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,740
incredibly encouraging but the parachute

147
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,090
did open up a little bit so that's

148
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,919
enough right besides wouldn't leave

149
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,310
three days so we're going for it so none

150
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,460
of us had a truck so we rented a truck

151
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,490
we rented a tank of helium we were going

152
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,940
to start with hydrogen so there's like a

153
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,740
helium shortage right and we felt like

154
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,210
oh we don't to contribute to the helium

155
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,710
shortage and it's probably expensive so

156
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,800
like hydrogen all works super well so it

157
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,540
will like hydrogen will absolutely lift

158
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,000
your balloon really well but like it

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,890
also did that for like the Hindenburg

160
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,660
but you know so we went to the place

161
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,000
where they sell compress air and we said

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,050
oh we'd like to get some hydrogen

163
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,550
they're like yeah totally great whatever

164
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,280
and he's like did you know that when you

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,520
open the tank of hydrogen it immediately

166
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,919
combust and it's so hot that you can't

167
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,050
see it but if you run your hand through

168
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,750
it it burns all your skin off and

169
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,590
there's just like a guy sitting behind

170
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,840
the counter he's like but we like to go

171
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,160
to the desert and fill balloons and

172
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,600
shoot them and they explode really good

173
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,180
and we kind of said well we're really

174
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,449
trying to not explode like ideally we

175
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,479
don't want it to explode so turns out we

176
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,979
could get some helium which was really

177
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,699
good so we threw this sucker into the

178
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,160
tank of our truck and took off to the

179
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,430
desert on the way we were attacked by

180
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,050
dust devils because the desert is

181
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,600
terrifying we also went to a really

182
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,130
weird McDonald's with this amazing wall

183
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,250
art it's got nothing to do with this but

184
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,550
take take it in for a second so this is

185
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,259
a picture of kind of where we were it

186
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,880
this is just an untouched picture it

187
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,770
just looks like that absolutely gorgeous

188
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,430
Joshua trees whatever so we get out

189
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,690
there right and ideally you would have

190
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,699
some type of regulator that would tell

191
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,800
you like here's how fast the helium's

192
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,900
going and like then you can figure out

193
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,430
like how much is in the balloon like

194
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,930
maybe have a little scale to measure the

195
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,080
lift we didn't have any of that but we

196
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,690
did figure that one of the people on our

197
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,909
team julian he could kind of hug about

198
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:12,400
this big and that's probably about how

199
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,740
big it needed to be so we just filled

200
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,210
the balloon up until Julian could hug it

201
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,770
we met we measured in Julian hugs so we

202
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,229
kind of did the problem was it was

203
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:25,270
absurdly windy just ridiculously windy

204
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,479
so this balloon is going crazy and they

205
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,479
are ridiculously thin we wouldn't have

206
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,310
lunch if we had any time to actually

207
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,070
think about this but we kind of had to

208
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,880
so here's our intrepid team its helium

209
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,950
don't worry it's okay he didn't actually

210
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,180
breathe a knee in he mighta breathe a

211
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,420
little in don't worry about it so we're

212
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,040
filling this balloon we're like super

213
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,810
excited we drove out for about an hour

214
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,420
and a half we'd had at this point almost

215
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,580
three days of solid work we've invested

216
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,170
our own money we got this stupid helium

217
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,640
tank we didn't die to the hydrogen and

218
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,460
this is basically what happened so it

219
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,390
exploded on the ground like right here

220
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,810
so we got the balloon filled up all the

221
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,940
way that it needed to be the only thing

222
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,880
we had to do was let go the wind blew it

223
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,670
onto my face and then my sunglasses

224
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,090
caused it to explode so it was like over

225
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,250
in an instant like bang balloons popped

226
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,380
and we're just kind of standing there

227
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,590
like did this really happen you know how

228
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,180
like rubber gloves they're covered in

229
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,340
like powder the powder was like shoot

230
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,050
like honor it looked like a cartoon like

231
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,610
just powder shoots in our eyes and we're

232
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,670
just like okay well did we get a backhoe

233
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,900
we didn't get a backup balloon of course

234
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,690
we didn't that's crazy talk and so that

235
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,760
was like really sad so you know come

236
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,380
monday we're doing like a demo of our

237
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,240
like awesome hackathon we're like yeah

238
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,360
we we got this balloon and we were going

239
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,470
to send it up there we were going to

240
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,730
take pictures you'd be able to see like

241
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,080
the curve of the earth and like that's

242
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,730
amazing where are the pictures and we

243
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,060
said we got some cool pictures of the

244
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,290
ground so we didn't really want to give

245
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,370
up right because we got we got so close

246
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,230
but outside of the bounds of the hack of

247
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,500
time that the hackathon hack of time we

248
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,050
we actually had time to kind of get our

249
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,000
 together so we all got a ham radio

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,320
together so we all got a ham radio
licenses hey I didn't expect that to

251
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,880
happen I didn't think that would be part

252
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,010
of like launching a weather balloon but

253
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,980
you know you kind of get into it so the

254
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,780
four of us like learned every bike what

255
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,040
we needed to know about amateur radio

256
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,830
and like did a lot of studying and took

257
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,870
a test and so now we've all got call

258
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,480
signs and like amateur radios and we

259
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
were playing around with ham radios and

260
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,900
this thing just completely spiraled out

261
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,690
of control we forgot to bring to helium

262
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,460
that tank back so we lost our deposit

263
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,550
and basically we were in this thing at

264
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,470
this point like okay we've got to do

265
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,670
something so we figured out like hey

266
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,240
okay we've got our ham radio licenses so

267
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,380
we can actually use

268
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,080
aprs to track this balloon so how are we

269
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,200
going to do that enter project con pollo

270
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,070
that's a very technical name a friend

271
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,750
Pavel who is also part of the team

272
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,270
created this it's out there on github

273
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,460
it's just mock and I his username / gian

274
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,120
paolo what this guy is is a little

275
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,490
library that runs on a Raspberry Pi and

276
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,860
gathers data and handles sending the

277
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,160
aprs signal and all that good stuff

278
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,580
totally custom totally awesome so it

279
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,100
took us forever to like actually get all

280
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,470
of this together but at this point we're

281
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,630
feeling kind of good like hey we're

282
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,090
actually going to do this the right way

283
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,080
as opposed to just kind of throwing

284
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,540
stuff together for a hackathon here's a

285
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,510
picture of the payload kg 70 x is

286
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,920
popples call sign I'm kg 70 YF now

287
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,220
dashana there also has one like I said

288
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,110
we didn't expect it in this project with

289
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,200
ham radio licenses but you know whatever

290
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,430
you can see the Raspberry Pi there as

291
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,050
well as an array of sensors we took like

292
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,150
temperature data humidity that kind of

293
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,170
thing so we you know after quite a lot

294
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,420
of false starts it took like a year for

295
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,710
us to actually get everybody on the same

296
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,770
page but one day we decided like let's

297
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,760
just do it so all of us got together we

298
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,430
met up and we just kind of hacked and

299
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,140
put it together and we said okay let's

300
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,840
let's launch this thing here's a picture

301
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,650
of the the new and improved spacecraft

302
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,990
we made it really shiny which is not

303
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,030
only cool because it's shiny it's really

304
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,400
good because airplanes radars can see

305
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,110
that better we didn't think about that

306
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,000
before so it may be a good thing that we

307
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,970
didn't like launch in the air if you're

308
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,770
curious if your payloads under like four

309
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,680
pounds you don't have to tell the FAA

310
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,320
which is cool because I don't know if

311
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,570
they would have loved this or not but uh

312
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,400
so we've got our cool spacecraft we've

313
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,720
got our hardware it's running JavaScript

314
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,010
awesome so we head out to the desert

315
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,820
we've actually got pictures this time we

316
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,710
drove out to approximately the middle of

317
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,770
nowhere and we got our helium tank that

318
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,310
we now own whatever

319
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,830
we got a wii another thing we figured

320
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,230
was that if we had like a sheet maybe we

321
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,700
could hold the balloon down it wouldn't

322
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,210
go so crazy so we just kind of got all

323
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,920
of us together and started inflating

324
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,900
this thing and we still didn't really

325
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,730
have a means of measuring how big it

326
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,990
needed to be so we just tried to

327
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,220
remember how big Julian can hug and just

328
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,290
sort of went with that ended

329
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,490
you can see tie you down here laying

330
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,780
under the balloon trying to tie the

331
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,570
thing together you can see our parachute

332
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,090
just kind of hang in there despite our

333
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,680
best efforts and how professional we

334
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,940
were feeling we were totally still

335
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,090
hacking this ham radio licenses or not

336
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,070
so we inflated to where we thought it

337
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,430
needed to be we tied it down and we just

338
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,270
let it go and it actually took off and

339
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,350
didn't explode in our faces this time

340
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,690
here it is in flight and it actually

341
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,560
took off so we were kind of just stunned

342
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,020
you can look at this stupid expression

343
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,670
on my face like that's the look that's

344
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,530
the look of a man who had had a balloon

345
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,210
explode in his face before and can't

346
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,120
believe that it's off the ground have

347
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,770
you had also been there for the original

348
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,440
and was equally stunned ty had not and

349
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,940
he just looks like he's walking away

350
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,290
like from an explosion like he's like

351
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,000
the coolest guy ever in this picture and

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,160
we're just like ghoul what so anyway we

353
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,380
calculated that I'll leave that up for a

354
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,260
minute we calculated that this balloon

355
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,600
was going to take like I forget like an

356
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,760
hour to to actually go up and land and

357
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,790
so we just kind of had to kill time so

358
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,950
you know I let me tell you about this so

359
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,430
there's a website called a PR SFI if you

360
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,770
are transmitting a PRS signals using

361
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,960
amateur radio you can just type in your

362
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,310
call sign and you can see where the

363
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,290
thing is that was the other amazing

364
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,360
thing is that that actually worked so we

365
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,060
could see this balloon overlaid on

366
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,520
google maps we accidentally entered the

367
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,050
wrong character code and it's labeled as

368
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,690
a house instead of a balloon so on the

369
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,250
map there was this house just kind of

370
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,900
like floating through the air like up so

371
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,070
we're just kind of watching this thing

372
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,020
for an hour whatever so like we took off

373
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,120
the in and out because I don't know what

374
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,070
else you going to do like once we let go

375
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,570
there was literally nothing we could do

376
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,570
it was just kind of out there what was

377
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,460
cool was a couple of us had tweeted out

378
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,230
the link to follow the thing with the

379
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,720
radio tracker and we had a few

380
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,490
people who had seen that on Twitter on

381
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,019
Facebook and whatever we're keeping way

382
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,089
better tabs than we were so we're just

383
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,860
sitting there like eating burgers just

384
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,449
kind of whatever and they're like hey I

385
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:09,980
think it's falling and sure enough you

386
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,420
look at the altitude and the number had

387
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,709
stopped getting bigger and it started

388
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:16,430
getting a lot smaller faster so we

389
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,529
hopped back in the in the truck and took

390
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:23,029
off after it so what ended up happening

391
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,670
was this thing flew for miles and miles

392
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,899
and miles i'll show you a map in a

393
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:30,529
little bit and it landed like way out in

394
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:32,300
the middle of nowhere by a dry lake bed

395
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,720
if you noticed you probably i don't know

396
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,470
if you can see them on the projector

397
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,709
there's a lot of power lines and like a

398
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,509
balloon with lots of cables and power

399
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,819
lines or like a super bad combination so

400
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:45,230
we were kind of terrified that this

401
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,810
thing was like out there burst into

402
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,290
flames because the thing is we lost a

403
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,379
connection to it so this thing's flying

404
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,639
in the air and it's sending out radio

405
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,829
waves right but once it gets down to

406
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:00,050
kind of a certain altitude it can't see

407
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,759
any more radio towers so we could only

408
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,610
track it to about 4,000 feet and then

409
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,890
it's just kind of where did it go so we

410
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,659
just drove around the desert to where we

411
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:15,199
kind of thought it was we found all

412
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,000
sorts of cool things out there like some

413
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,490
weird trash and like a cool cactus and

414
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,039
some tarantulas but we didn't find the

415
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,780
balloon um so we walked around until the

416
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,189
Sun went down we were out there for

417
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:29,620
probably two or three hours just

418
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,700
wandering around the desert looking for

419
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,039
the stupid balloon and we couldn't find

420
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:37,100
it so I'm having flashbacks about like

421
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,630
the last balloon that ended super well

422
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,970
I'm like no we got so close like we

423
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,530
actually sent this thing up and now it's

424
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,330
just out there somewhere so we went back

425
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,679
back home next day and kind of did a

426
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,539
little math and you know we could

427
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:53,570
actually analyze the data and we kind of

428
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,460
figured out like well maybe you know

429
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,470
looking at this map it maybe landed over

430
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,850
here ish kinda so the next day Pavel

431
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,280
went out and just sort of wandered

432
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,750
around the desert you can see his tracks

433
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,100
here you're just kind of doing this

434
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,130
random walk and we found the balloon

435
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,130
we've actually friggin found it I like

436
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,630
look how happy he is we've lost it I

437
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,550
mean but then the thing is okay did it

438
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,590
actually like work like software-wise

439
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,840
did we actually like take that cool

440
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,930
picture of the earth we totally took a

441
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,480
cool picture of the earth like that's

442
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:41,220
the friggin earth so I know it's like a

443
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,680
grainy like 640 by 480 picture but like

444
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,500
epid but it's like a real thing that's

445
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,420
the radio antenna hanging down we didn't

446
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,800
position it in a very smart place

447
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,760
compared to where the camera was so that

448
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,260
was really cool like that was enough for

449
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,990
me but Pavel kind of helped take it to

450
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,140
the next level so we actually had a

451
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,030
video and because we had this video we

452
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,920
also had the aprs data and we also had

453
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,170
the data that was gathered by the

454
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,350
onboard software so using that we were

455
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,080
able to overlay the video with where it

456
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,480
was on google maps so this is available

457
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,200
i'll send out the link and if you get

458
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,010
motion sick maybe don't watch right now

459
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,870
so this is the balloon taking off it

460
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,970
took off really fast like really really

461
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,830
hair like horrifyingly fast i'll kind of

462
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,360
skip forward to some interesting parts

463
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,490
but the cool thing is you can kind of

464
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,290
see like how long it's been the

465
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,270
temperature we were getting what the

466
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,240
altitude is which way we're facing so

467
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,890
you can see here we're at about 7,000

468
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,100
feet things are already kind of tiny

469
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,210
fast forward a little bit more 12

470
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,800
minutes and it's starting to look a lot

471
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,940
like the google map we're approaching

472
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,980
25,000 feet the temperatures 31 degrees

473
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,970
fahrenheit we can go even further we're

474
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,310
around 60,000 feet and you can see on

475
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,660
the on the map kind of where this thing

476
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,410
is going and it's just really cool to

477
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,840
actually be able to at least I think

478
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,330
it's cool to see the the video that this

479
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,560
thing took so it got to here's 80,000

480
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,780
feet which is ridiculously high let's

481
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,140
drop to negative 27 degrees Fahrenheit

482
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,450
that's Las Vegas right there that

483
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,360
kind of area right here it doesn't look

484
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,610
very cool from this high up but this is

485
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,920
actually Las Vegas and we can take the

486
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,360
google map here and kind of scroll over

487
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,010
and you can kind of match up what this

488
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,080
is next to what the google map is seeing

489
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,570
so we got 280 1000 feet we got we ended

490
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,740
up past 90,000 we got to almost exactly

491
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,170
a hundred thousand feet which we were

492
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,870
trying for like 90 or 95 and we managed

493
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,370
completely luck out that's a really good

494
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,980
view of Las Vegas if you can see that

495
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,280
long that kind of long road in the

496
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,720
middle is the strip yeah kind of neat uh

497
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,720
we face the camera facing down it would

498
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,160
have been cooler if we'd had it like at

499
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,260
an angle but again we're you know not

500
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,380
perfect at this so once we get to write

501
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,570
about a hundred thousand feet the

502
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,370
balloon pops and it starts just freaking

503
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,010
out we had absolutely no stabilization

504
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,260
or any thought into that and so this

505
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,730
thing is just kind of like flopping

506
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,800
around like this and trying to take

507
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,500
video this is kind of where I thought

508
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,030
that like a lion would break and the

509
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,440
thing we just plummet to the earth but

510
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,480
it held on so you can see that it

511
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,810
actually fell at not terminal velocity

512
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,610
which means the parachute popped that

513
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,230
was kind of the other really exciting

514
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,610
part is that it wasn't just plummeting

515
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,100
to the earth it was plummeting in a nice

516
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,380
controlled manner oh that's cool that's

517
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,420
a giant solar array out in the middle of

518
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,030
the desert I had no idea that was there

519
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,150
it's like a mile or two miles long crazy

520
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,880
I was kind of wondering if we were going

521
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,190
to like fly over area 51 or something

522
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,750
and like get in trouble but you know it

523
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,220
appears to be okay so this thing you can

524
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,990
see it falling I'm just going to step

525
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,290
through this a little bit it's actually

526
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,600
kind of cool to watch it here's a really

527
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,050
neat and terrifying part so let me

528
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,200
scroll back just a teeny bit so you can

529
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,100
see yon cat right here let me go to the

530
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,030
map view because it's a little more

531
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,580
obvious so you see this right here those

532
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,380
are mountains and you see this right

533
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,680
here that's the colorado river when we

534
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,690
saw that the balloon was heading into

535
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,190
the mountains and then

536
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,539
it got past the mountains into the

537
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,639
freaking River that's like the worst

538
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:44,340
case scenario because everything before

539
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,929
that is a nice flat area we didn't want

540
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,179
to have to hike too much and then just

541
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,360
by pure freaking look it caught a gust

542
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,039
of wind and turned the opposite

543
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,500
direction if that hadn't happened we

544
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,850
were so screwed so the camera cut off

545
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,019
right before it hit the ground but it uh

546
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:05,190
it just kind of ended up there in the

547
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,519
desert so you can see it's kind of final

548
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,580
resting place right here and I'll zoom

549
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,169
out a little so you can see kind of how

550
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:17,820
far it went so the scale here is well I

551
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,179
don't see a scale but it went a long way

552
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:22,230
like way longer than we kind of thought

553
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,559
it would but um this is out there at

554
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,059
Mach and I doesn't net / neon pollo

555
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,529
player like I said I'll tweet it out or

556
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:29,940
something but uh if you want to play

557
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,120
around with it we've also opened up a

558
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,950
repo with kind of issues and the data

559
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,320
that we got from this thing so we're

560
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,639
just kind of playing around with it and

561
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:39,960
seeing what we could do better next time

562
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,340
because now that we've actually

563
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,200
succeeded at it we want to do it even

564
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,019
better so besides all like the technical

565
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,230
part and kind of like how cool it felt

566
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,269
the best part of this was just like

567
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:55,860
hopping in the truck and driving out to

568
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,669
the desert and like having a good time

569
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:01,620
if this had just been like we're working

570
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,509
on a project and yes we did the project

571
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,340
and whatever it would have been cool but

572
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,860
it was it was genuinely genuinely felt

573
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,379
like an adventure there's something

574
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:12,419
about like writing your code and working

575
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:13,710
on your thing and then going out there

576
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,929
and like making terrible mistakes and

577
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:17,399
like having stuff explode in your face

578
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:20,639
that's like super exciting I work in

579
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:21,990
e-commerce so that doesn't usually

580
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,210
happen it's only like metaphorical

581
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,629
things that explode in my face so this

582
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:30,840
was really fun I guess if there's one

583
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,149
thing that I would make kind of the

584
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:35,580
summary of this talk is to like get out

585
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,690
there and have an adventure and try to

586
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,980
launch a thing into space even though

587
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,480
you're absolutely not qualified to do

588
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,090
that but that's about it I can't see the

589
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,879
clock but that's a that's the gist of it
