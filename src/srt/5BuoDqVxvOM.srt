1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120

nothing has been sacred since I was 11

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,759
years old when I first began to question

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,290
all assumptions including reality itself

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,769
and that locked me in a metaphysical

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,880
conundrum that led to the brain in the

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,420
box and as we evaporate away we have

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,269
nothing left but that of nothingness so

8
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:30,260
naturally I turned to science to study

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,000
the smallest primitives of the universe

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,399
in order to figure out if they could

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,160
provide an answer to metaphysics and

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,350
reality naturally that be the atom and

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,230
the orbital States and electron and

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,230
consequently quantum mechanics so in

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,960
that process I'd like to kind of give a

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,710
quick snaps asst of quantum mechanics we

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,070
have an electron at orbital state 5 and

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,250
it jumps to orbital state to you can

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,409
jump back and forth and the interesting

20
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,830
thing here that you might have heard is

21
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,340
that it actually teleports from these

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,689
two states it doesn't move in between it

23
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,360
doesn't move between the space it

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,470
teleports right so the difference

25
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,210
between those two states is negative

26
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,270
three from five to two you have a delta

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,890
difference of negative 3 that is

28
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,630
quantifiable and literally that is where

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,170
quantum mechanics comes into play

30
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,119
quantum mechanics is the quantifiable

31
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,079
difference between these orbital States

32
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,100
that's the world of quantum mechanics

33
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,579
however further further you get into

34
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,049
quantum physics with Schrodinger's cat

35
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,850
multi worlds theorem wave particle

36
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,549
duality kind of discover that it doesn't

37
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,549
really hold any good answers for

38
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:04,549
materialistic kind of existence or

39
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,600
giving you a basis for understanding

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,899
reality so with that I decided I needed

41
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,489
to go even further down the rabbit hole

42
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,330
of questioning assumptions

43
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,600
beyond science down to logic itself now

44
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,330
naturally logic corresponds a lot to

45
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,290
computer programming so when I was 16

46
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,470
after using logic for about seven years

47
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,750
I developed a metaphysical proof for

48
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,500
reality but once I had done that I no

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,120
longer you know was just sitting around

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,610
all day all night trying to figure out

51
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,100
whether you know I exist whether this

52
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,850
hand is real and one side done that

53
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,350
right I had a bunch of spare time in my

54
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,770
hands so if I'd already gotten into kind

55
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,410
of the logic side of the equation

56
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,940
computers might as well learn how to do

57
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,040
HTML and CSS since that was the natural

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,250
path I wanted to be able to take my

59
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,410
metaphysical theory which would be about

60
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,140
six hours of Socratic dialogue in order

61
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,610
for me to explain but I want to go to

62
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,709
present it to everybody I want to be

63
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,440
able to explain my concepts so of course

64
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,510
naturally go to the best publishing

65
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,520
platform in the world the web which

66
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,660
requires learning HTML and CSS let's

67
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,769
just say that CSS would not make for a

68
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,560
good metaphysical framework because it

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,230
is incredibly inconsistent unless you

70
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,550
wanted a reality that was completely

71
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,060
fractured take this left side CSS and

72
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,090
this right side CSS these two pages are

73
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,100
exactly the same with only one

74
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,050
difference which is the overflow

75
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,750
attribute now the overflow attribute of

76
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,610
CSS does something really simple at

77
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,660
least how it's described if you have a

78
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,250
container and you have content inside of

79
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,800
the container the content overflows the

80
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,540
limits of the container you got a couple

81
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,630
options either the box will scroll it'll

82
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,030
clip it so you can't see it or the

83
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,070
content will just flow past it and it's

84
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,890
visible now if you notice that my

85
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,140
containers just have a content of a and

86
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,840
B so they're not the content isn't big

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,540
enough to trigger an overflow so you

88
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,600
should think according to CSS that well

89
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,820
you know these will render exactly the

90
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,169
same because the overflow actually ok

91
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,490
nope what overflow does is it

92
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,150
consequently changes the

93
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,180
the entire rendering layout engine it

94
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,050
affects how the actual boxes are

95
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,449
displayed on screen and this isn't just

96
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,729
like a chrome quirk this is like across

97
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,830
all browsers so CSS o miserable and I'm

98
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,750
glad we had CSS college because I did

99
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,120
learn some tricks like vertical

100
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,039
centering now yay so that puts us back

101
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:55,699
in the black box right what are we going

102
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,270
to do to answer to solve for these

103
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,020
problems so I decided okay if CSS and

104
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,090
HTML can't handle it I should actually

105
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,350
pick up the logic side of the equation

106
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,800
javascript i could probably fairly easy

107
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,410
create a javascript library tool in

108
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,490
order to create a uniform CSS that would

109
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,740
give me a consistent reality or at least

110
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,410
a consistent web page and so when I was

111
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,910
16 actually one is 18 I created Excel

112
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,419
sir an XL sir is a tool that using a

113
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:30,949
whole bunch of JavaScript using

114
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:33,169
turing-complete logic and I kinda want

115
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:34,510
to zoom out here and say that

116
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,229
programming for the most part is just

117
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,979
three things it's data it's manipulation

118
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:43,690
of that data and it is communication and

119
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,340
with inside of JavaScript you you know

120
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,960
those categories break down where we

121
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,610
have your primitives you have loops you

122
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,039
have if statements with these eight

123
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,530
basic primitives you can essentially

124
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,389
build everything you can build minecraft

125
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,070
and minecraft is turning complete and

126
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,500
inside minecraft you could implement a

127
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,030
JavaScript interpreter which then

128
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,889
interprets Ruby which interprets

129
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:07,610
JavaScript so on so these are the tools

130
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,320
that you want to use they are the lowest

131
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,789
level things that you can build anything

132
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,150
that you want on top of now with that I

133
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,610
was able to do something really cool CSS

134
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,150
and HTML I built this tool excel so as I

135
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,830
mentioned that allowed me to change the

136
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,139
background color that allow me to change

137
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,789
the margin the box shadow the border

138
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,610
radius you know all this stuff as I'm

139
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,500
interacting with it right inside of the

140
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,000
web browser so kind of my ultimate web

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,860
designer tool that's running in

142
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,909
the browser and gives me kind of I can

143
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,439
actually use the keyboard kind of like a

144
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,060
video game i can i can push on the

145
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,270
keyboard every individual CSS and HTML

146
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,550
property is bound to some key on the

147
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,800
keyboard so it's give me a really fast

148
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,020
way to not only prototype the HTML and

149
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,810
CSS and see it as I react with it but

150
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,819
more importantly is giving me that

151
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,349
instant feedback that I could then

152
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:07,219
iterate on top of and it's flexible

153
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,960
because I'm trying to just build it on

154
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,110
top of the already existing kind of CSS

155
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,629
HTML not do too many assumptions on top

156
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:18,590
keeping things flexible so naturally I

157
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,900
wanted to get that you know CSS HTML as

158
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,150
updating as I manipulating it I wanted

159
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,620
every single person that came to my

160
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,439
website to see that in real time okay so

161
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,169
I wanted all these changes to propagate

162
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,539
out toward to everybody those on the

163
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,979
website and in that sense I'm generating

164
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,479
a lot of data i'm generating a lot of

165
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,419
deltas okay and i needed to store that

166
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,000
data someplace and unfortunately you

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,300
know as i mentioned there's the data

168
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,310
manipulation communication manipulation

169
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,680
of communication in JavaScript it's a

170
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,139
little wonky but it does the job but the

171
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,110
data aspect okay there's not really

172
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,060
JavaScript database well okay now we

173
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,169
actually have a bunch of JavaScript

174
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,919
databases like that and a pretty much

175
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,360
quarter of the people I met first day

176
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,060
we're working on JavaScript database but

177
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,560
regardless of whether as JavaScript or

178
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,300
not we really had two ways to express

179
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,870
data which is in a table sequel or as a

180
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,960
tree a document based storage such as

181
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,870
MongoDB but I don't know about you night

182
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,169
data isn't really that cool it looks

183
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,070
more like this my data trying to kind of

184
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,110
Express reality is a bunch of

185
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,370
intricately interconnected just massive

186
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,820
blobs of messy junk I don't even know

187
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,949
exactly what it is but it's it's there

188
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:48,050
right so trying to express this in a

189
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,589
clean way and a table or in a tree it's

190
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:53,209
just kind of unrealistic so

191
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,129
just one aspect of the data side right

192
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,059
which is I needed it to be graph-based

193
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:01,490
to handle the complexity of intricately

194
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,279
related data I also needed it to be

195
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,309
distributed decentralized okay because

196
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:09,559
if I have two people that are editing

197
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,720
the same page collaborative landed on

198
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,220
the other side of the world or the you

199
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,410
know the network goes out I needed to be

200
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,769
able to still work so i started gun and

201
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:23,439
gun is a distributed javascript database

202
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,999
now as soon as you get into

203
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,220
decentralized stuff distributed stuff

204
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,029
you encounter what quote the experts of

205
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,470
database say is hard and complicated

206
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,389
concurrency control and paxos and master

207
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:41,389
slave replication and quorum and all

208
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:44,269
this stuff but i want to kind of d

209
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:46,579
thrown the experts and say if we spent

210
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,709
more time actually describing what's

211
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,350
happening and bringing more people into

212
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,589
the field and looking at the fresh kind

213
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:56,089
of perspective that they have on the

214
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,480
data and on the problems will be able to

215
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,610
make more progress than simply being

216
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,889
dismissive of a stuff and things get

217
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,860
difficult because of the problem of time

218
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,509
okay so other illustration let's go into

219
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:14,569
nonlinear time by raising hands in the

220
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:17,839
audience just very simple question who

221
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,160
would say that these two cars are

222
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,939
different yeah all right cool yeah that

223
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:25,369
ones blue ones read the different cars

224
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:28,730
right but if we reframe this from a time

225
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,119
perspective right we get something a

226
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,399
little bit interesting now that you've

227
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,149
seen this time series of mutable data

228
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:40,309
right where you have the car and my

229
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,899
stick figure comes along and paints it

230
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,230
to be blue how many of you guys would

231
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,819
now say that this car is different okay

232
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:54,769
good good very very good a lot of people

233
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:55,999
though however might think this car is

234
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:57,850
the same because as a consequence of

235
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,249
change over time it's still the original

236
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,829
car but this poses a problem that's

237
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,720
answered more by our purse up

238
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,449
okay and i don't mean perception in some

239
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:11,240
like hindu mysticism type way i mean it

240
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,740
in the sense of quantum mechanics right

241
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,889
when the photon comes from the car of

242
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:18,230
the red or blue car and it hits our

243
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,540
eyeball one of the atoms in our eyeball

244
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,430
you know reacts to that photon it goes

245
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,470
from the orbital state of let's say to

246
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,410
and it absorbs the photon and jumps up

247
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,529
to the orbital state of five whatever it

248
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,500
may be the Delta difference so

249
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,079
perception or observation is measurement

250
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,540
okay and when we measure something we're

251
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,209
fundamentally affecting or changing its

252
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:43,759
nature we are mutating it it is mutable

253
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,949
data so again as I stated right we have

254
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,740
the difference the quantifiable Delta

255
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,490
from the two orbital States now this

256
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,980
kind of gets interesting because I want

257
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,290
to talk about house plants you're

258
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,990
innocent docile cute little house plant

259
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,079
well I have some bad news it's actually

260
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,899
a man-in-the-middle attack your house

261
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,149
plant is actually a malicious pier in

262
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,839
your kind of network topology because

263
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,970
what is doing is this taking the the

264
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,639
source of the light right which is kind

265
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,410
of you could say bouncing it's not

266
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,089
really bouncing off the plant but the

267
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,730
plant is absorbing the information from

268
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,559
the light it is absorbing all the

269
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,439
spectrum of light and it's corrupting

270
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:33,110
the data it's filtering out all the data

271
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,990
except for green and then it's sending

272
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,199
its real aying back to you this color of

273
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,970
green so you receive it on your eyeballs

274
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,350
and you see that the plant is green in

275
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,870
reality or let's say metaphysics the

276
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,569
plant is everything but green because it

277
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:49,939
absorbed all the other energy levels

278
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:51,800
except for green greens only one that

279
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,509
sent back to you because it's trying to

280
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:55,339
kind of screw with your mind it screw

281
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,110
with your perception it is a

282
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,149
man-in-the-middle attack ok but this

283
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,490
leads to some interesting questions like

284
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,420
why we we like that plants are green now

285
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,360
are we going to suddenly ban all plants

286
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,069
from our network because all of our

287
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:11,750
house plants from our network because

288
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,220
you know it's doing this man in the

289
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,870
middle attack the very kind of struck

290
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,980
of the plant is how it is changing and

291
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,450
corrupting the data again it comes back

292
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,710
to the perceptual component however the

293
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,330
brain is doing something similar and I

294
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,770
can express this by an interesting

295
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,810
factoid you may may or may not know as

296
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,940
neurosurgeons have removed half of a

297
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,310
patient's brain okay and you think that

298
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,080
if you removed half of your brain you

299
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,779
would like die right or you know not be

300
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:47,570
able to walk or you'd lose your memories

301
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,089
or your your personality your psychology

302
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:51,920
would change but no we've found that if

303
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,380
you remove half of somebody's brain for

304
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,680
the most part if you do it appropriately

305
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,240
they survive and not only do they

306
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,610
survive but they have all their memories

307
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,190
still intact that's that's incredible

308
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,210
their personality doesn't change they

309
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,160
still have the memories so the brain

310
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,650
itself is working as a distributed

311
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,830
system and storing your memories

312
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,870
replicated across the graph of your

313
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,370
neurons so if only our database could do

314
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,529
this right somehow if we could have the

315
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,020
same sort of consistency and replication

316
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,529
that our brain does and if we lose one

317
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,110
server you know it's fault-tolerant you

318
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,940
know that's the whole point sharding etc

319
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,580
etc master-slave replication but I

320
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,290
actually want to reframe this again a

321
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,600
little bit more put it in the black box

322
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,209
and say this seems familiar all the

323
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:47,600
stuff now looks like well Adams right in

324
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,910
order to have this appropriately we have

325
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,220
to have idempotent data transformations

326
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,650
and that's fancy words but all really

327
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,750
means is that when I have the orbital

328
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,580
state change a mutation in state and

329
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,700
that gets emitted out to these other

330
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,860
atoms or maybe I should pseudo

331
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,630
scientifically say like let's let's look

332
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,790
at these things as servers right and so

333
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,820
as I submitted out replicated that that

334
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,089
photon that delta that quantifiable

335
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,490
change is then absorbed by these other

336
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,470
atoms and the electron goes from a lower

337
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,940
overall state to the higher orbital

338
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,300
state but what's interesting is that end

339
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,520
servers we want some sort of guarantee

340
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,220
of

341
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,839
the message being rebroadcast it okay so

342
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,730
each server let's say rebroadcast the

343
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,680
message that it gets separate from how

344
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,899
it processes the data and as a result

345
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,329
this guy down here let's just call him

346
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:47,360
Carl gets the message twice so it's

347
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,750
important that Carl D duplicates that

348
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,579
message that he doesn't process the

349
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:54,620
message in the same way and what's

350
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,060
exciting about this is we actually kind

351
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,709
of see this in light you might have

352
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,569
heard that light doesn't really act as a

353
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:01,069
particle it doesn't even really act as a

354
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:04,009
wave it acts more like probability a

355
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:07,250
photon can travel in any possible path

356
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,399
it can spin around do loops and come

357
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,379
back around to you and we actually kind

358
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,879
of see this with the the rebroadcast

359
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,100
innocence of our servers if we have

360
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,449
multiple servers interconnected with

361
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,490
each other there's multiple paths that

362
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,930
the information can take so to express

363
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,699
this in a more salient human perspective

364
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:29,540
let's say sadly that Carl's mother has

365
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,180
died okay but he doesn't know it Alice

366
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,839
knows it so Alice tries to contact carl

367
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,420
directly Carl picks up and Alice tells

368
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,779
him that his mother has died Carl reacts

369
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:43,759
quite strongly with emotional trial of

370
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,439
hearing that his mother has died but

371
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,730
let's rewind a little bit let's say

372
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,230
Alice was not able to communicate with

373
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,709
Carl directly so Alice kind of calls up

374
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:55,069
Bob and tells Bob the news hoping that

375
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:56,899
Bob may somehow get a connection to Carl

376
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,149
and then Bob relays the news to Carl and

377
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:01,129
remember Carl hasn't heard about this

378
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,319
yet so when Carl here's the news from

379
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,199
Bob he reacts strongly because this is

380
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,760
the first time you sort the news it's

381
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,669
it's a traumatic experience but now

382
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:13,069
let's rewind again ok Alice has heard of

383
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,679
the news and rather than doing one or

384
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,380
the other Alice does both ok and as a

385
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,020
result Carl is going to get the news of

386
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,520
his mother's death the trauma twice now

387
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,130
the important yet sad part of this is

388
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,580
that Carl's reaction is what's called

389
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,740
idempotent when he hears the news the

390
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,630
first time that's where he has the

391
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,309
reaction of trauma the second time here

392
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:38,690
is that of course it's sad but he

393
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,700
already knows the information right it

394
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,940
doesn't affect his state per se ok and

395
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,510
so

396
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,490
from that perspective is we can take any

397
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,670
multiple paths when we want to

398
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,680
communicate to a server or something and

399
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,230
the data will all resolve and and the

400
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,790
fastest path is going to be the

401
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,950
probabilistic one the one in which it

402
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,680
has the lowest latency the closest

403
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,970
connection so kind of this represents a

404
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,950
lot of my research with gun and I

405
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,380
actually have it's not just all theory

406
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,970
and metaphysics and stuff I actually

407
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,690
have this working and I would love to

408
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,850
have you guys all try it out in payments

409
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,080
tall I'm just getting started have an

410
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,570
MVP and I'm excited to announce i just

411
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,700
got funding this week so if anybody

412
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,160
wants to work on distributed javascript

413
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,620
systems for fun or for pay please let me

414
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,290
know but i want to go back to something

415
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,250
that I started with right which is we

416
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,080
have our mind and I want to end with

417
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,170
this which is our mind is perceiving the

418
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,940
world around us but how do we know that

419
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,700
that's real the metaphysics of it and as

420
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,920
I was studying these things I started to

421
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,500
go a little crazy because you know I'm

422
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,090
starting to hallucinate that there's

423
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,100
this computer in front of me that I'm

424
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,380
typing code in that I have this body on

425
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,420
me right and slowly as i realized that

426
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,550
data itself in the sense of the

427
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,050
replication the item potent

428
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,510
transformation of data is being

429
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,370
broadcasted is actually a way that i can

430
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,250
look at metaphysics right this the stand

431
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,890
right here a thousand years ago was not

432
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,110
in that locality it's not in that

433
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,030
position and so I should just be at a

434
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,250
you know wipe my hand through it but

435
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,140
well you know that didn't work but

436
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,750
that's because the stand and me share a

437
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,810
common state relative to each other and

438
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,680
that is kind of the transformation that

439
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,290
data through these atoms or through

440
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,660
these servers but I want to go a little

441
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,310
bit further and maybe propose something

442
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,340
a tad too side of pseudo-scientific

443
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,890
which is what if our minds themselves

444
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,540
our perception or operating that same

445
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,970
what if mental illnesses such as

446
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,150
schizophrenia or dissociative identity

447
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,510
disorder are simply a person who has a

448
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,340
conflict resolution algar

449
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,049
a synchronization algorithm a

450
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:02,299
replication log that doesn't work the

451
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,400
same way that we do so take a sketch of

452
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,610
inec he sees things that aren't actually

453
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,650
there he hears things that aren't

454
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,510
actually there but what if that's just

455
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,179
because in the same way where you had

456
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,059
the example of the Alice and the Bob and

457
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,700
the mother dying that kind of

458
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,880
replication log in his brain is simply

459
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,120
operating at a different synchronization

460
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,159
algorithm the rest of us so they're

461
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,529
perceiving a reality at a fundamentally

462
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,559
different state in the context compared

463
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:36,049
to what we are now that's probably

464
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:37,850
pushing a little bit too far but I'm

465
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,710
just jokingly suggest that maybe the

466
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,960
grand unifying theory of existence is

467
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,690
data replication data synchronization

468
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,080
and with that I'd like to end nothing is

469
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,270
sacred question all things and in that

470
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,909
process you will only learn a ton but

471
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:56,210
you might discover really interesting
