00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,400
my second time in Singapore I really

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,230
like it here I think there's a huge

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,820
diversity of people and it just makes it

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,560
really really fun everybody that I talk

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
to seems to be doing three different

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,090
things with food and with just kind of

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,060
goes all over the place I am Tim this is

me I'm an avid tooth brush ax and you

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,760
might know me from some of my online

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,070
things you might have seen me from some

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,870
of the the previous events today so I'm

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,700
a tinkerer tuner tempura I just like to

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,340
make stuff I'm not really big on titles

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,620
but I'm an engineer I guess it had a bit

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,670
of a design or a bit of everything

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,030
really like all of us yeah so you might

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,379
have seen me on the first day where we

19
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,860
we won the family feud the JavaScript

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,570
family feud you might have noticed that

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,789
our team got absolutely no correct

22
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,530
technical questions but we were very

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,000
very good at guessing how much coffee

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,119
everybody drinks you might have seen me

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,770
ad code in the dark which was really

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,710
awesome on a couple of nights ago was

27
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,119
really fun I've never actually seen that

28
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,830
before people kind of coding without

29
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,110
being able to look look at what they're

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,090
making and and just see the results it

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,549
was really really fun event with Justin

32
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,189
organizing that and as they are standing

33
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,400
it as an as an emcee yeah maybe you know

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,290
me from some of my online things or

35
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,640
maybe you can get to know me through

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,729
these online things I was emceeing at

37
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,210
the CSS comfy you just late last year

38
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,880
and I kind of released a bunch of things

39
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,650
just for for a kind of potty pack

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,049
obnoxious that CSS is an example of one

41
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,659
of these I kind of wanted to do a take

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,329
on animate CSS but I wanted to do kind

43
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,720
of obnoxious animations obnoxious

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,579
animations are really really fun to make

45
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,110
they kind of go really big they kind of

46
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,820
get up in your face

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,189
and this is really what you need to grab

48
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,770
the attention of your users for all of

49
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,460
your websites

50
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,460
you know it's phenomenal I made this

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,320
website off four or five years ago the

52
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,780
useless web it you will click on this

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,890
please button and it will take you to

54
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,090
other kind of random websites that are

55
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,970
very weird and Audion line eel Slough is

56
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,319
an example of something like that

57
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,090
this whole website just exists so you

58
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,560
can kind of slap people with eels is

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,150
phenomenal who made that it doesn't make

60
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,060
any sense this is a library that I made

61
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,650
a couple of years ago

62
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,569
elevator jsut kind of scroll to the bone

63
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,650
on the page and there's one of those

64
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,180
back to the top buttons that everybody

65
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,740
always kind of sees

66
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:39,900
[Music]

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,319
provides you a nice enjoyable smooth

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,470
scrolling to the top experience last

69
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,930
year again CSS come for I put out smell

70
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,910
vodka I opened up the Helvetica font

71
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,069
file in font foregin and messed around

72
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,020
with all the kerning and made it really

73
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,620
ugly and messy and you can install it on

74
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,880
your friend's machine and it kind of

75
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,000
replaces the whole system Helvetica font

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,790
and it's just just weird enough that you

77
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,260
know if I put her on my mom's computer

78
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,910
she thinks that it's weird but she lives

79
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,769
with it and you have you know it's a

80
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,450
frustrating thing you know later on

81
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,310
someone will say all these websites have

82
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,360
looked really weird lately

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,459
oh whoops forgot to put forgot that I

84
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,680
put that on there again I released this

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,420
office simulator slack while we had a

86
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,190
great talk up here about buds before

87
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,560
which was really cool this slack ball

88
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,049
kind of simulates the mundane office

89
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,610
messages that you get every now and then

90
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,290
you know whoever left yoga in the fridge

91
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,900
got to get it out of there and and and

92
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,970
all that kind of business don't forget

93
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,319
you know the passive-aggressive don't

94
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,690
forget our dynamics lunch later on today

95
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,430
that's office life maybe you've seen

96
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,470
some of my more serious things these get

97
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,640
hub corners are all around the internet

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,019
you kind of hover the thing and it gives

99
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,910
you a little wave it's an i7 that was

100
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,489
regular for Cle buttons there's a fun

101
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,810
little project to make because you kind

102
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,090
of see it all over the place maybe

103
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,709
you've seen my LinkedIn profile pull of

104
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,109
dog pictures if you don't you can

105
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,549
connect with me on LinkedIn and you can

106
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,350
have dog pictures daily it's really

107
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,350
really fun look at these top top notch

108
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,049
analytics over here yeah so that's so

109
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,420
that's me if you've ever seen me speak

110
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,730
before you're gonna kind of realize that

111
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,859
this this talk topic is the same talk

112
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:16,829
that I've been doing for a while now and

113
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,570
I just thought I would just go straight

114
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,370
up front and tell you what the goals are

115
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,910
and what I want one of the point that I

116
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,160
want to make to everybody before we even

117
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,229
go and that's to kind of look at what

118
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,350
inspires you and and look at what gets

119
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,389
you excited and and not just kind of on

120
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,580
a web perspective but on a kind of much

121
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,710
grander scale I want you to realize that

122
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,360
you can kind of follow your feelings

123
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,700
with your ideas and you can chase them

124
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,050
down to the end and you can see where it

125
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,830
takes you

126
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,240
and it doesn't have to be big it doesn't

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,409
have to be small you can just kind of

128
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,550
get into it

129
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,070
I want you to kind of embrace the weird

130
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,050
a little bit you know just because

131
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,430
you're building something that nobody

132
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,510
else can use doesn't mean you should

133
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,070
stop building it because it is gonna be

134
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,780
a quirky thing and you're gonna learn a

135
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,950
lot along the way it's gonna be really

136
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,100
really fun and so the best way that I've

137
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,970
learned to do that is just by showing

138
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,800
you a few of my own kind of journeys in

139
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,140
my own explorations and where I went

140
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,420
with them and what ideas I had and the

141
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,090
kind of outcome and then hopefully you

142
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,590
can kind of see that and go well that's

143
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,450
really doable that's a that's something

144
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,780
that I can totally totally get into so

145
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,840
let's do that yeah recently I was at my

146
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,510
mom's house in Australia we're right in

147
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,790
the country beautiful place sugar cane

148
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,220
fields everywhere beautiful sunsets and

149
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,380
I was sitting in the lounge room the

150
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,910
lounge rooms just got kind of a big

151
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,980
comfortable couch lots of lots of

152
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,500
windows a small TV and a DVD player and

153
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,680
I found myself really really really

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,140
entranced and and I kind of snapped out

155
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,190
of it a little bit and I thought what

156
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,020
what was that what was just happening

157
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,050
and I was looking at oh these are the

158
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,640
movies that we have we've got very

159
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,070
Australian selection I was looking at

160
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,490
this on the screen DVD video and I

161
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,800
imagine probably everybody's seen this

162
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,440
and the DVD video if you if you haven't

163
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,440
seen what it does it does this it

164
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,720
bounces around the screen it's a square

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,330
box let's look at that first bounce

166
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,820
again once more for those in the back

167
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,860
this is where it destroys my hopes and

168
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,880
this is where it destroys my dreams we

169
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,280
can assume really that if I hate is

170
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,550
gonna hate and a potato's gonna - Tate

171
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,140
then a DVD logo will never hit the

172
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,810
corner of the screen and it's so

173
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,400
frustrating because you kind of lock

174
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,960
onto it and you watch it and you watch

175
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,340
it you watch it and I talked to a ton of

176
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,470
people about this and it's just I don't

177
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,300
know what it is some kind of odd human

178
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,750
nature that you want it to bounce splat

179
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,430
bang in the corner and I kind of thought

180
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,170
to myself what is actually happening

181
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,940
here let's look at the math let's kind

182
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,260
of try to understand it a little bit

183
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,290
let's put our scientific or hats on so I

184
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,900
started to try to dig into you know into

185
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,180
this world

186
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,850
and I found this fantastic blog online

187
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,680
called the lost math lessons is one of

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,840
those nice little Nishi internet things

189
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,330
it's this high school teacher who kind

190
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,860
of comes up with weird ideas from math

191
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,740
lessons and and writes about them and

192
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,540
kind of explains the math and I don't

193
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,310
think anybody kind of explained the math

194
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,470
behind this better than him so I thought

195
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,180
I'd put it up here so here you would

196
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,010
imagine that that square is a logo or

197
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,530
maybe a 1 pixel by one pixel logo and

198
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,770
it's 16 across and it's 10 high and we

199
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,360
can kind of see the numbers here and we

200
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,190
can kind of draw some conclusions so it

201
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,720
seems to be bouncing on the bottom and

202
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,630
the top every nine squares every nine

203
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,180
moves and it seems to be bouncing on the

204
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,990
sides every 15 and so we have 16 and 10

205
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,060
but if you minus one for the space that

206
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,639
the logo actually is you kind of get

207
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,039
that you get those numbers 9 and 15 and

208
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,780
the total moves it takes to hit onto the

209
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,370
corner is 45 which is actually the

210
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,620
lowest common multiple of 9 and 15 and

211
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,240
so that kind of fits into this formula

212
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,400
the steps to take to the steps that it

213
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,349
takes to get to the corner is the lowest

214
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,180
common multiple of the width of the

215
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,010
screen minus the width of the logo and

216
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,940
the height of the screen and the height

217
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,669
of the logo and yeah we just kind of

218
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,349
keep going with this math just just for

219
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:15,169
the sake of it if you put velocity is

220
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:16,849
its velocity equals distance over time

221
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,349
into that and kind of mix it around a

222
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:20,479
little bit you get this I won't go too

223
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,330
much but the time that it takes equals

224
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,039
the horizontal time which is the time

225
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,930
that a logo takes to hit one side to the

226
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,870
other side times the lowest common

227
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,490
multiple of the things before divided by

228
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,010
the width minus the logo with its top

229
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,209
stuff with the math I'm gonna start with

230
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:37,909
the math but using that I could then

231
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,560
calculate how long is it actually going

232
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,000
to take how long am I gonna have to sit

233
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,300
here until I get the corner hit that I

234
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,750
want it's like a drug and then I built

235
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,190
like let me like build a little demo

236
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,330
around here so I can look at the

237
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,800
different numbers and it's it's kind of

238
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,450
random because lowest common multiples

239
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,820
work that way so that you'll get some

240
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,440
numbers they're really really small you

241
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,230
know a hundred and 122 seconds that's

242
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,120
fantastic but then you get some that are

243
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,880
you know 3,000 seconds and it's just the

244
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,850
kind of depth and dynamics of the screen

245
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,770
3500 it's like what 50 minutes or

246
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,480
something like that there's our agreed

247
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,810
and so I thought well I've come this far

248
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,990
I can't stop what can I do about this

249
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,550
how can we fix this problem it's such a

250
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,920
it's such a huge thing as plaguing

251
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,740
society and of course the initial

252
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,090
reaction would be ah let me just speed

253
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,980
up Logan let's just walk into the lounge

254
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,940
room oh yeah there it is get that fix

255
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,660
this was the second second solution

256
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,260
that's kind of a COMSAT aspiring

257
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,540
satisfying result you think that's one

258
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,920
good let's get this going on just hook

259
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,870
it into my veins you know but after

260
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,340
making these little demos I kind of had

261
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,870
to think to myself and this is the

262
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,280
saying that I'm gonna use at what point

263
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,350
am I just eating ass last time I was in

264
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,440
Singapore I went to a cocktail bar with

265
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,960
Thomas and they had this ant cocktail

266
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,790
and they got ants and they put him on a

267
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,410
leaf and then they put him in liquid

268
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,210
nitrogen or something like that and then

269
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,150
you kind of eat the ants and drink the

270
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,480
drink and I was definitely intrigued I

271
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,970
had to taste the ant cocktail but after

272
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,820
a while I was kind of thinking this is

273
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,990
just eating ants this I know what adds

274
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,850
taste like now this is just eating ants

275
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,800
and these demos are a little bit like

276
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,150
that you know I'm getting a little bit

277
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,610
of satisfaction here but I'm not getting

278
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,710
the satisfaction that I would get if it

279
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,140
bounced lowly into the corner so I do

280
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,720
some drew some very technical graphs

281
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,700
here actually did these yesterday

282
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,690
there's happiness and it's overtime and

283
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,770
this is the one where it just hits the

284
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,680
corner all the time you get a plain base

285
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,760
level of happiness but this is the

286
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,170
regular experience in my lounge room as

287
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,110
I watch my happiness level goes down and

288
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,520
down and down and down and down and down

289
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,680
and down until I'm rock-bottom you know

290
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,140
really depressed and then hits the

291
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,470
corner bounces in the other direction

292
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,090
adrenaline everything goes go straight

293
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,640
up and so this is the wasted time in

294
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,700
this in this algorithm and it's just

295
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,250
crazy to think like how much how much

296
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,900
human time really goes into this what's

297
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,810
going on can I come up with another

298
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,610
solution can I come up with a better

299
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,820
solution

300
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,500
can I just take that time out of it and

301
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,560
just jump straight up into the happiness

302
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,230
and you're like stuff no this is how

303
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,100
intelligent a eyes are made they're

304
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,360
gonna take over the world you know it

305
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,649
starts with the screensaver and then it

306
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:37,570
is Skynet but we're not stopping we're

307
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,060
gonna keep going so I yeah so I built

308
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,240
the intelligent screensaver so it

309
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,000
bounces around as normal but then after

310
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,290
a certain amount of time it hits a point

311
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,970
it hits it goes super saiyan you know it

312
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,829
goes whoa wait a second what's going on

313
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:53,350
it puts a cost out where where am i

314
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,350
aiming to go ooh that's close what if

315
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,329
the angle is really small just small

316
00:11:58,329 --> 00:11:59,829
enough that a human wouldn't notice it

317
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,870
yeah let me just redirect let me refocus

318
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,880
on that bingo we're in you hit the

319
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,160
corner we got the happiness we can just

320
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,600
we can just go we can move on with our

321
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,579
lives I can go outside again Wow what

322
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:15,100
that was so weird but this is this is

323
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,540
exactly what I'm kind of talking about

324
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,089
today is this is a journey this is a

325
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,160
something that we've kind of gone on

326
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,170
I've started with something and I've

327
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,120
gone somewhere weird with it in my own

328
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,949
time in the afternoon a couple of

329
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:29,560
afternoons actually without any stress

330
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,380
without any real goals but at the end of

331
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,029
the day you can kind of say whoa look at

332
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:36,699
what we made here I made four demos Java

333
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,370
Script canvas html5 I did enough

334
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,949
research and enough kind of things here

335
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,750
for a small lightning talk or a big talk

336
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,579
in front of everybody played with the

337
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:46,959
requestanimationframe that Jake was

338
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,730
talking about played with cubic and

339
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,279
quadratic Bezier to do these curves I

340
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,680
had to look that up I had to understand

341
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,510
how that stuff worked a lot of line

342
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,160
intersection mouth kind of goes into the

343
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,380
into the one that actually focuses you

344
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,300
know if the first angle isn't immediate

345
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,529
then we're gonna have to see when it

346
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:04,510
does kind of land closer to the thing

347
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,750
and that's a lot that's a lot for a

348
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,519
square bouncing around the screen and

349
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,899
that's a lot of information that I'm

350
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,760
gonna retain and then I'm gonna have at

351
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,690
hand in any other kind of situation and

352
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,310
yeah that's that's what I'm kind of

353
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,690
talking about I also worked on a white

354
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,449
paper I'm kind of submitting it around

355
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,819
trying to try to stir people up I've

356
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:28,810
called it the screen Savior and it's a

357
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,880
yeah a whole writing about reducing the

358
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,350
overall time wasted you know it's that

359
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,180
white paper guff that they give you I

360
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,399
just want the information but no Julius

361
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,209
time

362
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:42,009
oops skipping some head yeah but that's

363
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:43,449
it that's a lot to produce just from

364
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,269
such a such a small little experiment I

365
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,329
think about balance a lot and whenever

366
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,759
whenever we talk about balance in tech I

367
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,290
think everybody immediately your head

368
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,540
will jump to the work-life balance which

369
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,949
of course we know is important then when

370
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:59,259
your balance is off you get you get

371
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,730
exhausted you get irritated you get

372
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,850
frustrated you get so so tired and it's

373
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,829
just hugely detrimental to your life of

374
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:07,929
course but the balance that I think

375
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:09,519
about a little bit more is the kind of

376
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,920
inter project balance so if we took that

377
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,600
red line there and expanded it and

378
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,790
looked at the balance within that this

379
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,589
is the this is the area that I find

380
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,869
really interesting in tech I I like to

381
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:21,519
use these kind of two terms on my scales

382
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,490
practice which would be oh you know

383
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,509
building Kings with the knowledge that

384
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:27,639
you have and then creativity is the part

385
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,839
where you're exploring different

386
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,149
solutions and you're trying to find

387
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:32,850
different ways to solve these problems

388
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,990
you're using different technologies

389
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,389
you're doing some research that's the

390
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:39,220
kind of creative side of it and I think

391
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,639
when this gets overflown and and it just

392
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,319
becomes maybe all practice you just come

393
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,790
in today as like oh what am i building

394
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,679
this is what they told me to build and

395
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,999
you don't have the creativity you get a

396
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:50,920
same kind of similar burnout and I think

397
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,019
when you're talking to somebody and they

398
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:55,809
get all antsy and gruff about what

399
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,429
framework you're using oh this isn't

400
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,439
good this isn't the best these are the

401
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:00,850
kind of people that tend to have a

402
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,889
little bit of a offset balance on that

403
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:06,999
on the inside yeah I also think a lot

404
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:10,660
about this guy gets electric shock III

405
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,139
talk a lot I think a lot about where my

406
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:15,579
mind is going when I'm doing certain

407
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,199
things I sometimes find what I'm doing a

408
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,410
project my brain is thinking oh here's

409
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,519
another thing that I want to do here's

410
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,629
another thing that I want to do here's

411
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,889
another thing that I want to do and you

412
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,470
kind of got I better rein myself in and

413
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,019
I similar that similarly down that vein

414
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,309
I have a little bit of a hard time kind

415
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:33,100
of meditating and having like a clear a

416
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,220
clear mind so I thought oh I'll go on

417
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,540
another journey I'll build something

418
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,970
else I'll do some experimentation and

419
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,220
I'll use myself as the guinea pig and

420
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,009
the the kind of thoughts and ideas that

421
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:47,350
were coming into my head of what project

422
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,519
should I even do in the first place you

423
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,430
know a lot of people have trouble just

424
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,140
taking that initial step oh I don't have

425
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,149
any ideas but there's so much stuff you

426
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,910
know kind of touched on this yesterday

427
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,089
when she said there's so much more

428
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,649
inspiration than just online you know

429
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:02,940
don't look at don't look at other

430
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,160
websites so yeah I was kind of looking

431
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,630
at myself I was thinking about menial

432
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,279
tasks I was thinking about things like

433
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,620
the screen saver but and then the other

434
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,120
the other kind of dimension that I

435
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,430
wanted in this project was what are

436
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,050
things that I find captivating and of

437
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,970
course that menial tasks captivating the

438
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,060
there kind of opposites but can I

439
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,220
include them into the same in the same

440
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,630
project because that's what meditation

441
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,480
seems like to me really people just kind

442
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,640
of zone out into a special place and

443
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,470
they want it they need it it's

444
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,300
captivating to them they have benefits

445
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,490
to it but also they're kind of not doing

446
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,959
anything

447
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,360
and so yeah I kind of went out and

448
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,970
looked in search for in search for this

449
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,279
project and I just thought I'd mentioned

450
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,750
briefly this kind of streetlight effect

451
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,980
the people sometimes get when they're

452
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,410
searching in for new projects the

453
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,270
streetlight effect is this kind of idea

454
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,820
about a bias that humans have where the

455
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,320
way that it's usually told is this drunk

456
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,850
guy is kind of lost his keys on the

457
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,589
ground and he's searching around trying

458
00:16:58,589 --> 00:16:59,760
to find him searching around trying to

459
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,500
find him and a police officer comes and

460
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,970
he goes I just lost my keys and the

461
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,140
police officer was kind of looking

462
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,059
around as well and they can't find him

463
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,530
and he goes are you sure you lost him

464
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,630
here and he goes oh no no I'm just

465
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,980
searching under the streetlight because

466
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,470
it's the easiest area to look whereas in

467
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,300
reality I think there's so much more out

468
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,280
there and in the world rather than just

469
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,569
kind of going straight to the internet

470
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,150
for your ideas so I was just looking at

471
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,660
everyday life menial but captivating

472
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,010
brushing your teeth I brush my teeth

473
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,650
every day twice a day and it's kind of

474
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,020
weirdly I'm into it you know I want to

475
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,940
do it

476
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,770
wake up you EU breakfast knives and

477
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,290
forks you switch the light on and so I

478
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,340
thought I'd run with this idea of

479
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,230
switches switching things on you know

480
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,670
that's a part of meditation in the first

481
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,900
place really you don't know you want to

482
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,809
kind of switch on by switching off so I

483
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:47,730
looked online I found a few nice kind of

484
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,950
designs code pen was a really good

485
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,809
resource switches

486
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,460
I thought have I done anything with

487
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,870
switches before oh yeah I've done a

488
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,220
couple of projects I built this

489
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,559
programming simulator that's very very

490
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,789
accurate everyone can play at home

491
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,710
I I did another one a trying to fall

492
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,679
asleep simulator what what did I do that

493
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,630
today how much if I go to sleep right

494
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,940
now I'm gonna be like I was so down five

495
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,850
years ago you know this is the the going

496
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,039
to sleep cycle in my head I've done

497
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,419
things with switches before I've kind of

498
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,159
played with them what would happen if I

499
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,590
put a ton of switches on on the screen

500
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,899
and so that's what I thought I would do

501
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,929
I would just kind of make a screen of

502
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:31,850
switches oh this is kind of nice like

503
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,389
going green

504
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:36,990
oh maybe I'll go down here a little bit

505
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,259
it's weird it's captivating I've started

506
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:41,190
now I gotta finish

507
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,570
oh I filled in this whole square I'm

508
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,009
gonna gonna make everyone stay until I

509
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:48,299
originally I had a hundred on here but I

510
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:58,899
thought I'd cut it down to the top oh

511
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:01,379
it's weird like you see that reaction Oh

512
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:04,830
what you know this this idea totally

513
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,820
hooked onto me now the idea of focusing

514
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,240
on something like switches yeah that

515
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,470
just did it so I figured oh I'm just

516
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,940
gonna build a bunch of game similar to

517
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,470
the switches similar to the switches

518
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,389
screen what other things are captivating

519
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:19,710
what do I do when I'm bored what do I do

520
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,080
when I'm you know just laying around or

521
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,399
in meetings or something like that

522
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,379
oh I doodle a lot I kind of draw and the

523
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:27,299
way I tend to draw is either spirals or

524
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,309
draw a box and then try to kind of color

525
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,289
it in and then I thought about

526
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:33,090
meditation of course the other big angle

527
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,740
there's kind of these zen gardens which

528
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,929
I guess is what I'm doing now you know

529
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:38,730
the the monks would do these gardens and

530
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,340
it's just a captivating task for them

531
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,379
when they're really just trying to learn

532
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:47,279
to be blank in their mind so I thought

533
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,870
okay well let's make a let's make a

534
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,120
spiral game here's the spiral and you

535
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,720
hover it

536
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,029
I can I can abolish it I can get it I

537
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:58,860
went too fast go to slow down nice and

538
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,190
centering whoa slow down I'm nervous in

539
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,070
front of everybody it's like live coding

540
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,139
but live spiralling that's an eSport of

541
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,560
the future

542
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,130
yeah let's give me that all right so

543
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,430
spyro is awesome I've got a second game

544
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,070
again wow this is really I'm enjoying it

545
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,240
I'm enjoying it let's do another one

546
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,190
let's let's keep going with this

547
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,500
nature is something you know you're out

548
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,420
for a walk you're out having fun nature

549
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,600
was a perfect inspiration for for this

550
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,790
this project and I thought yeah let's

551
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,020
make another game let's kind of keep

552
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,520
going with this here's a it's almost

553
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,130
like how things in the forest will will

554
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,810
rot away and they'll slowly break down

555
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:44,780
oh yeah this is doing it as well I can

556
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,250
go fast you know but it's not as

557
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,720
rewarding I'm gonna have to start

558
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,830
sitting down gonna have to start

559
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,630
concentrating to kind of hit all these

560
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:56,030
points off oh I'll do this one Oh at

561
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,920
least get all the big ones no I'm just

562
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,180
gonna do it all okay all right you get

563
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,520
the point and I thought oh this is kind

564
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,720
of great let me just wrap all these

565
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,090
games up let me put them in a bundle and

566
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,860
so that's exactly what I did I thought

567
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,270
I'll build out a little website I called

568
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,520
up the Zen zone registered domain put it

569
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,790
on there and yeah so that's it that's

570
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,700
the kind of Zen zone you can come in

571
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,110
pick a game that you want to do let's do

572
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,590
the swirl let's do it for three minutes

573
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,180
so you can kind of see when you do one

574
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,260
there will be a second one that will

575
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,630
kind of slide in and you get you get

576
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,010
kind of focused out on you'll get

577
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,110
enjoyment and this is exactly what I'm

578
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,280
talking about it's like oh here's

579
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,500
something that I've made from nothing

580
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,880
with random ideas that I've kind of just

581
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,260
picked up along the way

582
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,030
it kind of provides a little bit of use

583
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,340
it's super nice you know I'm stressing

584
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,750
out about the talk over here I can kind

585
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,510
of sit and focus myself away and and

586
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,150
build something just for fun and yeah so

587
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,830
that's the lesson it's kind of a just

588
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,480
wanted to demonstrate so much that you

589
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,190
can just kind of put things together and

590
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,080
not only that is I've kind of build this

591
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,910
whole platform you know I build a whole

592
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,260
website experience I played around with

593
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,000
react I made a bunch of different games

594
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,190
canvas in react is this whole whole

595
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,730
different thing

596
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,430
recursion for those those crushing bowls

597
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,440
the spiral it turns out is called an

598
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,970
alchemy daeun spiral and there's all

599
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,620
this kind of math behind it I just

600
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,600
messed things up put everything on

601
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,940
Amazon you know do all the domain it's

602
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,580
like oh this is a huge bundle of things

603
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,650
that I've had to learn and

604
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,540
just to get on that way and not only

605
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,130
that is I've kind of built a platform to

606
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,480
build other things you know if you have

607
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,400
more kind of weird meditation ideas or

608
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,290
anything like that I can just kind of

609
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,600
add them on a dam onto the side so

610
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,740
that's yeah that's kind of what I want

611
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,760
to just want to talk about I just

612
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,260
hopefully give everyone a little bit of

613
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,450
food food for thought there's my Twitter
