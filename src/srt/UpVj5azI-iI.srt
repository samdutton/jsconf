00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,219

hello everyone I hope you had a great

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,590
day as much of a great day as I had I

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,080
mean this is my first CSS comp which I

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,240
guess makes sense because this is the

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,109
first CSS cough here but actually I I

6
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,689
was at dais comp us and I didn't go to

7
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,109
CSS comp us and I heard so many good

8
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,640
things about it that I knew that when I

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,230
was coming over here again to another

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,180
Jay s coma that I would want to come to

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,460
CSS comps so I'm actually really honored

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,020
that I got a chance to speak and that I

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,850
got a chance to talk to you guys today

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,760
about the future of CSS so the title of

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,030
my talk is CSS levels up and I searched

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,070
really really long and hard for just the

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,930
right video game shift that I could

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,850
throw in here and I just couldn't make

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,199
up my mind in the end it really really

20
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,140
was disappointing so just pretend in

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,399
your head right now that the Final

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,050
Fantasy victory theme is playing and

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,390
anyway okay so that was only funny to me

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,239
but um so anyway as Jen said my name is

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,460
Angelina Favreau I work for Mozilla and

26
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,770
I work on the Firefox operating system I

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,270
am what's called the Technical

28
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,619
Evangelist which I believe is a little

29
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,020
bit of a misleading term I think people

30
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,950
assume when they hear the term

31
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,439
Evangelist that that means that we like

32
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,909
the people on my team just kind of go

33
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,100
around and just give talks like this

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,840
right now but that's actually only a

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,090
small fraction of what we do most of the

36
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,590
time I'm actually interacting with

37
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,840
developers like you and looking at your

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,520
code and helping you get your apps ready

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,710
for the marketplace I spend some time

40
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,420
coding tools to help developers like

41
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,340
right now I'm working on a Ruby module

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,579
that does JWT verification for in-app

43
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,470
payments and sometimes we do like

44
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,210
workshops for example for a Firefox OS

45
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,950
so I do a lot of developer education as

46
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,930
well so if anybody's interested in

47
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,820
Firefox OS and you think you want to

48
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,259
know what skills you need to which work

49
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,610
on that you can come find me at the

50
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,990
after party tonight and I'll be happy to

51
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,119
talk shop with you about that but for

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,369
now we're going to talk about CSS so

53
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,460
anyway last year I gave a talk at Jess

54
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,310
Kampf on shadow DOM and we've had lots

55
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,290
and lots of talks since then on web

56
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,640
components which makes me really excited

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,349
because one of my favorite things and

58
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,870
when I dove into that topic I actually

59
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,140
knew nothing

60
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,990
about it so what happened was is a few

61
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,640
people said to me Angelina you know

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,830
you're good at you know communicating

63
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,750
information and we think that you should

64
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,880
submit some talk proposals at some point

65
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,830
and I was totally terrified and I told

66
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,030
myself like okay you know what I'm gonna

67
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,530
do I'm gonna pick a topic that I know a

68
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,090
little bit about and I think it's kind

69
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,010
of interesting and I'm gonna submit it

70
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,420
and like probably it's not gonna get

71
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,730
picked and then lo and behold a couple

72
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,080
months later somebody's like guess what

73
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,360
you're gonna talk at Jas comp I'm like

74
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,140
that's great

75
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,010
oh boy so I mean I knew what you know

76
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,420
shadow Dom was it wasn't totally blind

77
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,310
but the first thing I did was I dove

78
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,220
into the w3c documents and learned

79
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,920
everything I possibly could about all of

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,390
the web components stuff I basically

81
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,480
read those specs inside out more times

82
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,220
than I want to even tell you because

83
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,810
that was a lot of my Friday nights for a

84
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,130
while and I sort of became this armchair

85
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,200
w3c spec participant and what that means

86
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,450
is that I participate on some of the w3c

87
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,280
lists that are public and you can join

88
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,190
them I look on most of them because I

89
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,110
only really say something when I think I

90
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,940
have you know something valuable to say

91
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,140
and I've thought about it a lot

92
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,850
and one day I would actually like to be

93
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,290
someone writing those specs so that's

94
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,690
part of why I participate there and I

95
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,920
mean why do I do this

96
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,640
so earlier when Nicole gave her keynote

97
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,079
she said oh I've you know I've read some

98
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,970
of the specs and I don't want everyone

99
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,560
to have to and then I was sitting with

100
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,030
Jed and he and I were catching up

101
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,260
because he wanted to know about like

102
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,299
introducing me and like you know whether

103
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:41,739
he could say embarrassing things or not

104
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,230
and he and he was like asking me about

105
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,579
what I was going to talk about and I

106
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,900
mentioned that I would talk a little bit

107
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,209
today about w3c process so that people

108
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,670
understand how CSS features come into

109
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,799
being and I told them that one day I

110
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,440
would like to work more on w3c specs he

111
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,250
was like why would you want to do that

112
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,200
so I want I want to shape the web right

113
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,739
like the web is where I grew up I I

114
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,000
think the first thing I did on the web

115
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,560
when I was I don't know how old was I

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,269
remember was IRC and I remember being on

117
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,890
the web and I remember building websites

118
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,420
with lots of animated gifs

119
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,079
I still do that basically and I followed

120
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,030
the w3c stuff because I want to

121
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,640
understand what is coming I always want

122
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,190
to be on that bleeding edge much like

123
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,260
you guys I find new things shiny and

124
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,510
exciting

125
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,820
and on top of that I want to be able to

126
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,890
teach developers what is coming because

127
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,860
those specification documents are very

128
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,950
very dry sometimes and I'll explain why

129
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,080
that is but first let's talk about a

130
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,020
little bit of a brief history of CSS I

131
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,790
think in our industry that we have a

132
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,890
little bit of a terminology problem

133
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,060
and actually not just a single

134
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,520
terminology problem but like a number of

135
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,860
them so for example when someone asks me

136
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,800
you know what is web components are what

137
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,080
are web components I'm like well web

138
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,820
components is actually a little hat for

139
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,770
several sets of technologies like shadow

140
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,990
DOM HTML imports

141
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,330
you know maybe decorators those are

142
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,210
weird to me still and templates and

143
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,370
stuff like that so web components

144
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,020
doesn't refer to any single one of those

145
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,400
things those are all the technologies

146
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,370
that enables that who here knows what

147
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,400
html5 is right like we've you've been

148
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,650
using the term html5 to describe a set

149
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,210
of technologies as well when you see

150
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,280
that in some like you know HR person has

151
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,320
put it on you know like a job posting

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,230
somewhere you know that html5 means HTML

153
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,300
probably to the you know Loveleen a

154
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,460
level five specification or version 5s

155
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,230
specification but it also includes

156
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,720
JavaScript and usually includes you know

157
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,340
level three CSS modules

158
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,460
it doesn't just refer to html5 and so

159
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,230
CSS has a little bit of a terminology

160
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,720
problem now the first version of CSS one

161
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,240
was the first spec was published in 1996

162
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,430
and included some core things like font

163
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,470
properties text attributes and alignment

164
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,650
color of text backgrounds margin border

165
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,960
padding positioning like basically the

166
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,470
basics right and then CSS to that level

167
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,270
sped the let CSS two level spec was

168
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,420
published in 1998 a superset of CSS one

169
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,820
we got more positioning stuff like

170
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,150
absolute relative fixed and z-index we

171
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,740
are aural style sheets bi-directional

172
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,680
text support media types and then people

173
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,660
kind of thought long and hard about CSS

174
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,220
too and decided a lot of it was all

175
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,720
wrong and they sort of bumped it up and

176
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,590
it became CSS 2.1 this finally became a

177
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,950
recommendation in 2011 it fix stuff by

178
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,690
removing poorly implemented features

179
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,850
from you know CSS one and two

180
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,500
it was iterated and tweaked for a long

181
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,870
time because yeah it's inception and all

182
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,790
that was you know

183
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,830
before 2011 2011 was when it sort of got

184
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,320
like you know the big thumbs up but

185
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,670
basically it was a more solid and

186
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,460
carefully defined specification and then

187
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,770
we came to css3 right let that's part of

188
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,890
the the little hat that is html5 but

189
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,560
it's not actually a version of CSS which

190
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,730
is pretty interesting because everybody

191
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,920
refers to css3 as like you know version

192
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,830
3 of CSS this is when CSS it was

193
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,490
actually factored into various modules

194
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,960
and the earliest module drafts were in

195
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,540
1999 and CSS had so many groups of

196
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,160
features they were split into modules

197
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,020
just to make development of each set of

198
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,180
features a lot easier rather than just

199
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,790
put everything under one hat by June

200
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,250
2012 there were over 50 modules so when

201
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,630
you think about that scale it makes a

202
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,530
little bit sense to sort of

203
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,210
compartmentalize them and modularize

204
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,030
them a little bit and arguably some say

205
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,160
css3 is a monolithic version but in

206
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,620
practice and if you look at the docs

207
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,280
css3 or perme that the advent of css3

208
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,920
was when the maintainer x' decided that

209
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,150
we're not going to actually have like a

210
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,610
css3 version but modules themselves will

211
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,140
sort of be individually versioned with

212
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,510
like this leveling system which I tell

213
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,610
you just reminds me of video games and

214
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,850
so in css3 level level 3 modules of

215
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,060
things like media queries namespaces

216
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,350
selectors level 3 and color have

217
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,120
official recommendations and I'll talk a

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,140
little bit about like what these

219
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,430
recommendations mean in a moment so CSS

220
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,120
for this is a blog post by a gentleman

221
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,060
named tab Atkins and tab is a fantastic

222
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,850
contributor to the w3c specifications he

223
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,620
does a lot of work he's a main editor on

224
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,350
many of them a very smart guy and he

225
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,810
wrote this this blog post and he

226
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,360
regularly gets people asking him so when

227
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,280
is CSS for coming and he's like there's

228
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,110
no such thing there never will be a

229
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,120
thing we're do things by modules now and

230
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,310
it was very funny that when my talk was

231
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,320
announced for you know this conference

232
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,000
somebody started tweeting they're like

233
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,340
well you do know that there is no CSS

234
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,070
for right and I'm like yeah no I know

235
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,510
that thanks did you read the talk

236
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,669
description about terminology problems

237
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,250
but there's always people like that so

238
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,310
CSS for anyway the CSS for level 4

239
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,140
modules are so fresh that I don't

240
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,880
actually know the dates of when most of

241
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,500
them had inception like that

242
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,740
that knew and they level independently

243
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,310
just like the css3 ones CSS four is not

244
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,460
a monolithic version so you know people

245
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,810
would argue that you shouldn't call it

246
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,850
just CSS four but rather refer to the

247
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,040
status of each module individually but

248
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,840
 it just call the collection of CSS

249
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,640
it just call the collection of CSS
4 module CSS for you know that even

250
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,020
though we have this conversation people

251
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,550
are still going to refer to as CSS 4

252
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,770
come on right like HTML 5 came to mean

253
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,620
like JavaScript and CSS 2 it's just I

254
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,480
surrender to it and I don't know if

255
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,800
other people are gonna get angry but I

256
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,140
just say call it CSS 4 and and just be

257
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,730
really specific about the module if

258
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,340
someone wants to be picky about that so

259
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,070
let's talk a little bit about where CSS

260
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,510
comes from I'm talking about like this

261
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,000
w3c process and these these modules

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,510
having various levels well you guys are

263
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,280
probably familiar with who the w3c are

264
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,610
does anybody here not know who w3c is no

265
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,230
hands okay cool I thought there might be

266
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,820
one or two but you know you can never

267
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,890
really tell the the level of expertise

268
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,180
of the audience and apparently you guys

269
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,620
are awesome

270
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,080
so the w3c working groups spec browser

271
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,300
tech out and the CSS working group spec

272
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,150
CSS Oh makes sense so how does an idea

273
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,880
become a feature and what exactly is a

274
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,570
specification in this context so

275
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,350
specifications like I mentioned are

276
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,910
particularly dry documents and that's

277
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,800
because specifications are not written

278
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,960
for you the users they're actually

279
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,520
written for the implementers the people

280
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,890
who are writing the code that makes the

281
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,330
user agent the browser that you're using

282
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,300
and it defines very carefully how the

283
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,670
browser implementers should you know

284
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,440
implement those features so that we

285
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,000
don't have as many headaches with things

286
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,550
like cross browser compatibility and so

287
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,790
that they are as to say interoperable so

288
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,830
it's not a user manual it's really for

289
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,120
the programmers that are implementing

290
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,339
the materials but that being said you

291
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,839
can learn a lot from reading these

292
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,580
specifications you can learn basically

293
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,100
what the future of the language features

294
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,620
are for CSS so the first thing that

295
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,650
happens is well ideas and did you know

296
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,480
that there was once a spec called

297
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,380
JavaScript style sheets yeah so this was

298
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,820
apparently a thing I just learned this a

299
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,260
short while ago it was only ever

300
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,050
implemented in Netscape 4x there were no

301
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,520
selectors you would just modify

302
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,040
properties of the document tags object

303
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,270
and so you would get something

304
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,830
this and you can see that you're

305
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,650
modifying like tags h1 color equals blue

306
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,810
that would change all of the h1s in a

307
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,580
document to blue and all of this

308
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,260
interestingly enough is inside of a

309
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,720
style Tet or sorry a style tag but it's

310
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,690
style type text/javascript which is

311
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,460
pretty interesting to me anyway that

312
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,820
totally was nixed but you also remember

313
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,860
that scroll bar thing that I II did it

314
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,780
was only ever implemented in Internet

315
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,940
Explorer circa 5.5 this one didn't

316
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,710
actually I think really ever have a spec

317
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,590
like the jss s1 did this was just

318
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,120
something like I use like hey wouldn't

319
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,340
it be great if users could change the

320
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,620
default scroll bar on the window and so

321
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,150
you got stuff like this I'm sorry if

322
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,650
this is a little bit small but you were

323
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,090
able to specify like scroll bar

324
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,160
highlight color scroll bar face color

325
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,260
and this was the point for me that when

326
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,670
I was getting really into web

327
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,750
development I thought this was the

328
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,310
coolest thing of course you know me

329
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,290
being like how old was I like 12 or 13

330
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,470
or something like that and I didn't

331
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,760
understand like why this would be a

332
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,710
problem for accessibility usability I

333
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,240
just thought grad I can put colors

334
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,280
everywhere and so you know there it is

335
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,080
in action in Internet Explorer so that

336
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,670
was like a very vendor specific thing

337
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,040
that did not become a feature so I mean

338
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,660
it starts with ideas and not all ideas

339
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,760
are good ideas right but sometimes good

340
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,260
ideas make it into what's called a

341
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,600
working draft and the working draft is a

342
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,550
snapshot of the current state of

343
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,430
discussion around a set of features at

344
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,740
this point with a working draft you can

345
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,300
go to the working draft you can see what

346
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,070
the reflection of what people are

347
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,920
talking about on the w3c lists and it's

348
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,170
sort of a codified document of the

349
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,400
things that people have been able to

350
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,550
agree upon and not always agreed upon

351
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,020
either if you go through the documents

352
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,370
to find little green areas about like

353
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,750
hey this is good you'll find little red

354
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,370
areas like hey maybe we should add an

355
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,380
example here or this is a problem

356
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,360
because of this other feature or

357
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,650
something like that

358
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,210
and at this particular stage with

359
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,270
working drafts the w3c also solicits for

360
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,070
user input so for anything that you find

361
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,880
in the w3c that that you think is very

362
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,650
interesting and has a working draft you

363
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,360
can jump on that list and you can

364
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,790
contribute to that discussion and so at

365
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,620
this point anything that's a feature in

366
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,540
working draft stage is unstable and

367
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,750
incomplete so after people have bickered

368
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,880
a lot on the internet as one one tends

369
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,630
to do the

370
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,040
can graph we'll move into a stage called

371
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,930
last call and that is when the working

372
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,400
group expresses that the draft is

373
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,130
basically complete and all of the major

374
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,650
issues and problems with it are resolved

375
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,630
and that is sort of your last chance to

376
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,070
bring like major issues in the

377
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,690
discussion like oh no if we implement

378
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,490
this in a certain way the earth will

379
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,020
explode and hopefully you've resolved

380
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,280
that issue so that the earth will not

381
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,200
explode when you try and load your web

382
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,870
page in your browser after that we move

383
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,730
to candidate recommendation and this is

384
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,350
actually the most important step for you

385
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,040
the users because this is the step where

386
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,480
the group is expressing that all the

387
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,130
issues are resolved and not only that

388
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,020
but you actually want to move into

389
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,390
implementation this is when browsers can

390
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,030
actually you know browser vendors can

391
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,640
actually say ok shadow dom or you know

392
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,560
CSS variables now we're going to start

393
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,540
putting this into the browser and users

394
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,460
are going to start testing it so they

395
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,220
actually start to implementation then we

396
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,920
moved on to proposed recommendation by

397
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,480
this point and after testing these

398
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
features in the browser for a while

399
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,870
there should be a comprehensive test

400
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,880
suite develop and the implementation

401
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,040
should be in at least two major browsers

402
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,240
pardon me there should be at least two

403
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,770
shipping implementations which sort of

404
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,320
implies major browsers so for example if

405
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,740
say Chrome and Firefox or Firefox and

406
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,110
opera or Safari and you know some pair

407
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,220
of browsers has implemented those

408
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,190
features probably with some iteration

409
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,020
and feedback we might want to move that

410
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,970
spec to a proposed recommendation and

411
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,520
the w3c members will generally review

412
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,560
things at that point and you might think

413
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,490
that we're done after proposed

414
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,870
recommendation but no no there's more

415
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,720
bureaucracy to go so then we go to

416
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,950
recommendation that is the final stage

417
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,140
there's no more recommendations after

418
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,910
that this is where we say ok we think

419
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,400
that this document that describes how

420
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,780
this feature should be implementing the

421
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,390
browser is good we're done with it at

422
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,430
this point there's nothing else done

423
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,380
except for some time there's some errata

424
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,840
that's amended but it's also important

425
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,100
to note that even though something

426
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,840
becomes a recommendation it can also

427
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,250
become obsolete by another piece of

428
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,520
technology or another recommendation and

429
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,770
this process is nonlinear for example

430
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,810
right now CSS level 3 selectors are

431
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,850
being developed alongside CSS level 4

432
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,330
selectors and many cs3 or css3 level

433
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,300
modules CSS level 3 particles

434
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,000
are actually like they're not near their

435
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,410
recommendation status they're nowhere

436
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,760
near complete some of them haven't even

437
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,690
been implemented yet so that being said

438
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,490
that now that you understand how

439
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,990
features are made and you know that

440
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,880
there are some CSS level 3 modules that

441
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,920
are still percolating I can tell you

442
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,990
that there's actually some CSS level 4

443
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,510
modules and so if we have like sort of

444
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,460
like a timeline or not a timeline of

445
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,230
like you know how far in the future

446
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,810
things are and like you've got you've

447
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,270
got like CSS 1 & 2 are all really solid

448
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,130
and like CSS 3s may be right here

449
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,300
because like some of the modules are

450
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,230
starting to be stamped you know

451
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,540
standardized and put into browsers CSS 4

452
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,310
is way out here so the stuff that I'm

453
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,240
going to talk to you about today is

454
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,040
stuff that I've gone to the

455
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,840
specification documents and I've pulled

456
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,370
out there they're interesting things

457
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,990
that I thought were cool to share but I

458
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,250
wanted to look ahead a little bit

459
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,170
further and so my warning to you is that

460
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,840
all this stuff is a work in progress so

461
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,160
you can actually go and take a look at

462
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,570
these documents you can go to the lists

463
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,860
and give feedback if you think that

464
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,570
they're cool ideas or if you think the

465
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,400
ridiculous idea is like it's okay to say

466
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,710
like well that's ridiculous it can and

467
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,800
will change and it will change Lots so

468
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,970
super future level 4 specs there is the

469
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,740
borders and backgrounds level 4 module

470
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,150
and there's some really cool things in

471
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,970
there for example in addition to your

472
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,590
border radius we're going to have

473
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,750
something called corner shape we'll be

474
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,820
able to describe a curve a convex curve

475
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,430
at the corner a bevel a diagonal slice

476
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,100
at the corner scoop a concave curve at

477
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,870
the corner and a notch which is a

478
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,970
concave rectangular notch at the corner

479
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,800
and officially I don't have photos of

480
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,910
this because there weren't any examples

481
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,560
in the spec so you have to use your

482
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,870
imagination and I think that this is

483
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,490
particularly interesting especially if

484
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,260
you've seen some of the stuff that Leah

485
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,210
vero has done with her border-radius

486
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,750
talk that she gave it a CSS comp in the

487
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,870
u.s. like the the other CSS comps and I

488
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,190
think that there's some really cool

489
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,600
opportunity there to combine things you

490
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,730
can do with border-radius having

491
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,650
additional shapes that you can do with

492
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,280
them with your borders now so there's

493
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,230
that and then we've got something called

494
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,420
border clip which I find a little bit a

495
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,240
little bit ridiculous but in a good way

496
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,630
and so a border clip sometimes you want

497
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,430
to hide parts of abort

498
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,200
maybe you do maybe you don't I mean I

499
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,490
actually hadn't thought about it before

500
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,780
I saw a border clip and then I thought

501
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,150
that it could be a really interesting

502
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,960
really interesting for people that

503
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,790
create art in the browser and use only

504
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,160
CSS so it's a set of properties border

505
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,650
cliff top right bottom border clip left

506
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,360
and of course naturally just using the

507
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,150
border border : as a shorthand property

508
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,380
will work like you would expect other

509
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,500
properties to and it when you're

510
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,840
specifying your units you can also use a

511
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,780
fraction or FR fractional unit which is

512
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,940
a unit specified by the css3

513
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,640
specification or sorry css3 grid

514
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,950
specification and a fractional unit is

515
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,650
described as one sheriff space in all

516
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,210
the available space of an element so

517
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,720
it's sort of a relative unit and i'm not

518
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,550
totally 100% sure if that one's going to

519
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,100
stay as a fractional units i also was

520
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,750
reading about one called like a gr like

521
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,060
a like a grid unit so that that's a bit

522
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,920
ambiguous but for our intents and

523
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,690
purposes we can refer to this relative

524
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,420
fractional unit for describing this but

525
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,550
so here's an example we have at the top

526
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,200
there we've described a border that's

527
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,940
thin solid black so it would go all the

528
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,770
way around the box and then what we've

529
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,420
done with border clip is we've said that

530
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,520
for one fractional unit and because only

531
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,380
one is specified that means the entire

532
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,020
element we're just going to say that the

533
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,700
border is clipped entirely so as the

534
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,320
comment says that would hide the border

535
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,330
and then what we do is we say border

536
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,970
clip top we want to show exactly ten

537
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,280
picks up ten pixels of the black border

538
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,680
then fill in one fractional unit and

539
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,740
then ten pixels and that one fractional

540
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,240
unit basically fills up all the

541
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,980
remaining space except for the twenty

542
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,530
pixels of that we've specified that we

543
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,730
actually want to show and so we've done

544
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,440
the same on the top and on the bottom an

545
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,780
example 35 the second one there we've

546
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,910
sort of done the same thing again we've

547
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,800
got border tops in solid black border

548
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,320
bottom thin solid black and we didn't do

549
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,520
anything to hide the borders here but

550
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,140
instead we just specified that we want

551
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,030
to clip the top and the boredom bottom

552
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,980
after the ten pixels

553
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,750
only ten pixels you end up with just a

554
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,250
little bit of a line but you can do more

555
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,020
interesting things with this so in this

556
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,050
example here we've defined a four pixel

557
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,360
farming four pixel border that's also

558
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,610
black but then we've used the fractional

559
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,890
units to actually describe the border

560
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,830
itself and use the like the absolute the

561
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,840
pixel units to describe the space

562
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,730
between those fractional units and so

563
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,460
you get something like this and so the

564
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,840
length of these border border parts will

565
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,130
change when the width of the element

566
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,630
changes so you can imagine like you know

567
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,360
like expanding this expanding this and

568
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,529
some sort of like a responsive layout

569
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:15,820
maybe and then it will change

570
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,549
accordingly so and as it mentions there

571
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:19,779
the read there is just for illustrative

572
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:21,370
purposes it says there that you know the

573
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,659
browser shouldn't implement them in red

574
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,490
that's how specific these documents are

575
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,600
but I thought this was particularly

576
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,010
interesting I think that for people that

577
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,779
you know spend a lot of time in CSS you

578
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:30,039
could do some creative things with this

579
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,860
and also imagine combining it with like

580
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,419
the the different border or partly the

581
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:35,799
different corner shapes as well you can

582
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,299
come up with some very interesting Lee

583
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:40,059
shaped divs no longer are you limited to

584
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,860
boxes I think we saw from the CSS

585
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,200
animations and stuff and the geometry

586
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,480
earlier that that's definitely not the

587
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,980
case today but this opens up the door

588
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,669
for more things so media queries level

589
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,130
for this is one that I really like

590
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,350
actually so there are a lot of devices

591
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,890
now that have ambient light sensors and

592
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,140
what level for media queries introduces

593
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,909
is luminosity and luminosity will allow

594
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:09,429
you to apply styles for specific

595
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:12,299
lighting conditions as reflected by the

596
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,559
ambient light sensor on your device

597
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,159
so you can specify for dim and dim would

598
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,649
be used for you know like nighttime you

599
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:21,909
know there's not very much light and so

600
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,190
so in that case high contrast styles

601
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,740
would probably be fairly distracting

602
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,450
also for normal you know whatever that's

603
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,210
going to mean but that's ideally

604
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,070
described as the environment where the

605
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,580
luminosity is ideal for reading and and

606
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,320
it's the ideal arrange for the screen

607
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,330
that you have and then also washed which

608
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,950
is of course the high the the brightest

609
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,330
end of things maybe you're reading on a

610
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,210
device in the sunlight and of course

611
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,880
that washes everything out so maybe you

612
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,919
do want high contrast in that situation

613
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:52,330
now I think all of this is very

614
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,830
interesting and of course like I say

615
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,919
this is well into the future but you

616
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,690
know devices with a light sensor usually

617
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,460
sort of auto adjust and it's going to be

618
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,049
a little bit hard I think to make

619
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,820
assumptions across devices about like

620
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,470
what a good baseline is but I think the

621
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,490
good news is that people are thinking

622
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,049
about this because I really don't like

623
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:10,090
it when like my I've got an iPhone and I

624
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,649
also have a Firefox OS device and they

625
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:13,120
both have ambient light sensors and they

626
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,649
both behave differently and I'm just

627
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:15,730
like well

628
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,750
that tells me this is going to be really

629
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,670
hard to standardize but also I like the

630
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,410
idea of doing something to compensate

631
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,850
for that change I think that's actually

632
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,960
something that we should be thinking

633
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,200
about so oh here just sorry here's an

634
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,450
example of luminosity so for example we

635
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,920
could have a media query for a normal

636
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,660
luminosity and then maybe we have like

637
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,920
specific color of text for that

638
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,830
obviously when adjusted for you know the

639
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,890
dim and then the washed as well so the

640
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,690
image values and replace content module

641
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,610
for level 4 namely this is the one that

642
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,750
I found interesting from this is

643
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,330
actually image set so I mean how many

644
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,590
people here have had to deal with

645
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,410
multiple sets of of assets for things

646
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,180
like retina display and for various

647
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,860
resolutions like basically everybody

648
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,180
right like people are already putting up

649
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,040
their hands so this is allows you to

650
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,880
specify an image set and and after

651
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,200
specifying the image set the user agent

652
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,030
the browser will refer to this image set

653
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,310
and figure out for you what the best

654
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,010
assets are to download for that user

655
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,690
agent with that resolution it's sort of

656
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,010
like takes care of some of that logic

657
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,900
for you which i think is a really good

658
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,400
move forward especially for the

659
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,140
responsive web ok so this one this one I

660
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,440
find kind of amazing so this one here is

661
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,360
is it says element but this is under the

662
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,300
image specification and this is where

663
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,930
you're able to use an HTML element as an

664
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,640
image so you take yes yes I know hold

665
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,430
onto your pants' okay so I think I

666
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,690
should crack the champagne for this one

667
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,590
because this is kind of my favorite

668
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,350
because I don't even really know what I

669
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,120
would use it for yet but that means that

670
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,040
there's someone out there that will use

671
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,330
it for something just that's going to

672
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,610
blow my mind in any case so how it works

673
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,890
is is you've got element it takes an ID

674
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,560
selector and in this silly example here

675
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,750
the paragraph element has been reused as

676
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,730
a background elsewhere in the document

677
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,960
so you can see you've got a source

678
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,180
element that's you know got a line

679
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,500
background with some white text and

680
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,180
you've got like the destination where

681
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,280
that element is going to be reused as an

682
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,110
image and there it is sort of like

683
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,810
patterned around there so I can imagine

684
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,460
like some situations where someone

685
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,860
creates kind of like a you know like a

686
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,640
CSS sprite but made only of CSS and then

687
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,170
once it's rendered they could then reuse

688
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,250
that to make some pretty creative

689
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,230
patterns so even though at first glance

690
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,970
like this is a really silly example I

691
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,200
think that that sort of

692
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,769
this has some potential as well so

693
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:35,350
anyway the last one is CSS selectors

694
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,889
level 4 so CSS selectors level 4

695
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:40,630
actually is probably the one that's been

696
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,039
getting the most attention it's the

697
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,200
first along because it adds like some

698
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,120
selectors that people have been really

699
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,159
wanting for a while and as some

700
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,720
functionality that you already find in a

701
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,179
lot of pre processors so I feel like you

702
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:53,470
know the specification is sort of

703
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,840
playing catch-up and that pre processors

704
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,490
have done like a really excellent job of

705
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,909
forging the way with what we'd call like

706
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:02,289
what we sometimes call like a prolly

707
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:03,940
fill like sometimes you refer to like a

708
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,250
polyfill that is like some you know like

709
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,049
some code that helps fill a feature that

710
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,429
a browser hasn't implemented but there's

711
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:11,470
a specification for some I would almost

712
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,820
look at the things that pre processors

713
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,100
have done as Frawley fills which is they

714
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,450
went ahead and implemented stuff like

715
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,240
CSS variables and and other sort of

716
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,070
logic Contin Combinator's and stuff like

717
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,889
that and by implementing those and

718
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,210
showing that there's demand for it that

719
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,010
can also inform like the direction that

720
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,289
specifications go as well so I haven't

721
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:31,750
like the CSS selectors level for is

722
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,580
worth worth definitely worth a read I've

723
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,049
only picked like a few of the ones that

724
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:36,610
I thought are useful and also in the

725
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,779
interest of time so one of them is the

726
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,070
one of them is matches so in this

727
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,779
particular example like compare the top

728
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:45,549
example where I've specified on each

729
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,700
line you know the anchor tag link the

730
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,289
hover the visited the focused and then

731
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:50,889
I've given them

732
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:53,169
text-decoration:underline with matches

733
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,120
I'm able to specify them and just just

734
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,399
add much tidier lists

735
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,440
and I rather like that notation I think

736
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
that that's pretty fantastic and also I

737
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,519
can imagine a situation where I have a

738
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,929
div that's a header and a footer and I

739
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,490
just want to change the text color for

740
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,320
those I might do that in that way so I

741
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,490
think that matches has a lot of

742
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,360
potential not sort of self-explanatory

743
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,029
you could say that for all H ones that

744
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:17,980
are not you know with the title class on

745
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,370
them

746
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,190
everything else is red someone asked me

747
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,049
like why wouldn't you want to use just

748
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:25,179
an ID and make a specific rule for that

749
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:27,610
and I don't know that's kind of up in

750
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,659
the air for me I gotta like think about

751
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:31,630
that one you know doing doing it this

752
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,669
way it means that instead of just using

753
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:35,740
like an ID imagine that you wanted to

754
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,179
have more things with this sort of

755
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,580
specificity of only targeting like we

756
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,019
were one element and then at least with

757
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:42,309
this one you can add like a list of

758
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,610
selectors to

759
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,410
and with an ID you don't necessarily

760
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,360
want to have like an entire you know

761
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,220
chain it kind of messes it kind of kind

762
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,929
of adds length to your CSS file and I'm

763
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:53,090
all for writing shorter shorter code the

764
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,590
less code you can write to do the same

765
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,200
job I think the better so then there's

766
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,030
the parent selector so this one actually

767
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,289
I had to think about philippics I

768
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:01,280
thought it's pretty interesting when I

769
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,690
saw it so there's there's actually an

770
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,370
exclamation mark in there which I'm not

771
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,530
sure is a really great use of notation

772
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,210
or not really great notation considering

773
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,250
we also use like the important tag I

774
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,750
mean ideally you don't use it very often

775
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,460
but we've got the exclamation mark with

776
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,580
the the important tag and so what's

777
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,929
happening in the first line there is

778
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,100
that using that that exclamation mark

779
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,440
after the li element it will select all

780
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,179
list elements that our parent to an

781
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,070
anchor tag that have the active class

782
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,960
applied so that's really useful for

783
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,780
styling navigation lists rather like it

784
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,070
because I can think of times where I'm

785
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,360
like okay I really want to select the

786
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,770
parent of this one but do I put the

787
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,929
active class on the LI or do I like move

788
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:41,720
that around and and I I like things to

789
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,340
make sense and be orderly and I feel

790
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,270
like this gives me more of an

791
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,470
opportunity to do that with like a

792
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,480
navigation menu and in the second

793
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,640
situation that one there says select any

794
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,640
parent of an input or an anchor tag and

795
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,650
so then you might change the background

796
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,760
for those I don't know that you'd want

797
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,289
to do that for both inputs and anchors

798
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:59,330
this is just some arbitrary example for

799
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,080
you to understand how it works so oh I'm

800
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,730
sorry that the blue text on that is hard

801
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,409
to read I should have changed that so

802
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:08,030
just just credits here there's a really

803
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,130
great article on Smashing Magazine

804
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,809
it's called sneak peek into the future

805
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:14,390
CSS selectors level four and that one

806
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,679
talks a little bit about the ones that

807
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,000
I've talked about and a few more and

808
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,669
also there is another article on CSS for

809
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:21,980
selectors um if you I haven't pushed

810
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,480
these up to github yet these slides but

811
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,580
if you follow me on twitter at Angelina

812
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,919
Magnum I will do that within the next 24

813
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,240
hours because come on guys there's a

814
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,350
party later so and so polyfills right

815
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,720
like yeah all this stuff is totally in

816
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,280
the future and I told you you can't use

817
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,510
it today but I want you to be interested

818
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,860
in what's coming and if you have

819
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,010
opinions on it share them and polyfills

820
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,390
you know give me give me giving you what

821
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,850
can I actually use sorry as far as my

822
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,590
research has taken me only selectors

823
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,539
level four are really polyfilled at all

824
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,720
and I've found them in it's hard to read

825
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,940
they're SEL is a tiny tiny selector

826
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,470
I very kind of like sizzle but they've

827
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,260
gone ahead and implemented I think all

828
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,970
of the level 4 selectors so if you feel

829
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,930
like you want to play with them

830
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,150
immediately then you can go and download

831
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,180
sell and and you can actually try that

832
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,230
out so this is also a poorly colored

833
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,780
link that says list of mistakes in the

834
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,940
design of CSS so when I was reading

835
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,590
through all of these documents as as one

836
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,310
does on my Friday nights I found this

837
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,080
document called list of mistakes in the

838
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,420
design of CSS that the CSS working group

839
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,770
has on their website and there are

840
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,540
things like border radius should have

841
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,330
been border corner a

842
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,380
vertical-align:middle should actually be

843
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,210
txt middle because it's not really in

844
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,480
the middle box sizing should be border

845
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,690
box by default table layout should just

846
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,680
be same so I really loved reading this

847
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,360
list and I wanted to include it because

848
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,640
I want you guys to be involved in shape

849
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,280
the web so that all of these things you

850
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,900
know like so this list stations short as

851
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,700
it is it's not a long list I mean I

852
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,870
thought of a few things that could make

853
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,460
it longer but we want it to be as short

854
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,170
as possible because we want a really

855
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,060
nice experience for developers we want

856
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,860
things to be nice and interoperable on

857
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,410
the web so I want you guys to consider

858
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,930
being involved in shaping the web like I

859
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,670
said reading the spec documents is often

860
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,020
dry but I can tell you that the color

861
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,590
commentary on these lists is not boring

862
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,880
feedback from everyday developers like

863
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,940
you is crucial from my participation on

864
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,380
these lists as somebody who's not

865
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,770
necessarily a w3c spec writer I can tell

866
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,210
you that sometimes I feel like the

867
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,770
people writing these things are a little

868
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,810
out of touch and I know that they're

869
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,670
writing for the programmers that are

870
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,560
going to code this in the browser but I

871
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,970
think that they need more feedback from

872
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,980
people like you and you can join the

873
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,960
wwww style mailing list that's specific

874
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,340
to CSS but if you're interested in other

875
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,110
things like we know Web Apps and and

876
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,760
other technologies that have to do with

877
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,560
the browser then there's lists for that

878
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:49,920
too

879
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,260
and then speak up don't be shy I know

880
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,520
you're gonna go there and you're gonna

881
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,020
think what I didn't be like oh man these

882
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,700
people are so smart they know so much

883
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,650
about the browser and that's that's fine

884
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,030
maybe you don't know about all the

885
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,820
implementation details of all the things

886
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,500
that are that are go into that but you

887
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,270
can still give them informed opinions

888
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,550
about what developers are using so

889
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,620
anyway that concludes my talk thank

890
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,360
