1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,559

judge Smith so you probably think and

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,210
this guy has really excellent German but

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,379
no I'm actually I'm from New York I

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,210
don't actually speak German so I didn't

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,439
know what to do the intro and shy like

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,820
doing English but then that's kind of

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,500
douchey cuz like here's this American

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,240
coming in speaking English so I didn't

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,220
want to do it in English so here's I'm

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,630
gonna try I'm gonna try giving you the

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,849
intro to today's conference entirely in

12
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,579
CSS this is the challenge I'm a little

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,860
bit nervous about it I studied all of

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,170
the html5 element names I studied all

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,579
the css3 property names and so here we

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,180
go intro dot CSS or if you're German

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,149
introduce a set pre 96 anyway okay cool

18
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,030
so first of all hi hi you all hi

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,309
everybody here is your intro I'm

20
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,390
basically just want to give you a

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,350
background about CSS comp I'm sorry that

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,780
is that's notthat's turn the numbers but

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,670
then the and it's a nice orange so yeah

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,159
CSS come I think you'll love it it hurts

25
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,470
me too don't worry but before we start

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm just going to some filler content

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,360
here and you might find it a little bit

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,390
off-color you might find it the jokes

29
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,520
are somewhat opaque maybe some of the

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,570
jokes are a little bit of a stretch

31
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,460
speaking of the jokes I'm just gonna

32
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,820
list them up you know it's trying to

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,930
lighten the mood

34
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,700
some of them might make you a little bit

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,259
barest you know make your face red or

36
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,880
make you blush better known as FFF oh f5

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,430
but I am a bottomless trove of bad CSS

38
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,469
jokes so don't make any trouble there

39
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,869
they're all funny but like every tenth

40
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,990
joke will float just right and will be

41
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,259
comic gold so just bear with me if it

42
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,300
seems slow gold also obviously FF d700

43
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,260
so it's gonna give you a background of

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,710
the area

45
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,170
here we are in Berlin it's a conference

46
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,890
about style in a city that has style

47
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,780
Berlin has so much style its styles have

48
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,740
style and that just keeps repeating

49
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,920
forever yeah it's like just walking out

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,970
on the street just seeing people on the

51
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,900
street

52
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,690
man it is so stylish even here at

53
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,310
Berghain people waiting in line have

54
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,320
style you would say they have inline

55
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,370
style and because it's Germany the line

56
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,650
height is about 2 2 X what it usually is

57
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,750
where I'm where I'm from but you don't

58
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,100
want to use inline styles is right

59
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,920
that's bad you wanna use these class and

60
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,450
you know this is City obviously is a lot

61
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,250
of history it has a lot of class I

62
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,100
haven't seen this much class it's almost

63
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,780
too much class like villains almost too

64
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,790
classy I haven't seen this much

65
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,590
excessive class since I last used

66
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:11,430
moderniser about the area also we are

67
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,020
right next to the Berlin Wall if you I'd

68
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,410
know it's about 2 million pixels to your

69
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,850
left

70
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,140
it is this solid border that used to

71
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,920
divide Germany until 1989 when it

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,410
collapsed so it's uh it's actually kind

73
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,760
of hard to find you actually can't find

74
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,620
the Berlin Wall with CSS you're gonna

75
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,660
need to use JavaScript using jQuery I'm

76
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,220
sure you guys all know how to do this

77
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,110
jQuery just put a selector so you just

78
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,890
find an area that has sold off and you

79
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,840
can find the Berlin Wall it's a he's

80
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,490
wearing a jacket you'll you'll see it

81
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,740
shouldn't be hard fine

82
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,750
so about this address where we are right

83
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,470
now we are on in bleedin Strasse and

84
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,850
again I don't know German I'm pretty

85
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,740
sure that in bleedin Strasse in english

86
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,540
would just be a street address that is

87
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,690
disabled it's my guess it's a breed and

88
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,060
about this particular section of this

89
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,290
area it's Beth it is a sim back or

90
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,430
another but the position of this place

91
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,010
it is right in the centre of Berlin you

92
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,040
can see these beautiful white walls the

93
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,450
background here is white

94
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,090
better known as ffffff but it's actually

95
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:27,540
the

96
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,650
a little bit old so it's faded a little

97
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,830
bit it's actually more like a fa eb d 7

98
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,400
better nose antique white apparently

99
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,290
fading is perfectly natural this in a

100
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,210
white space perfectly normal if that

101
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,580
happens I don't worry about it

102
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,250
this is actually like a parish you can't

103
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,930
really tell it's not on display but this

104
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,880
is actually you know a religious

105
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,250
institution so it's not on display but

106
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,840
if you were here like maybe 50 years ago

107
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,510
it would be more of a display:none kind

108
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,170
of thing anyway so let's talk about this

109
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,370
conference it is an import from the

110
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,130
states CSS comp started we're gonna hear

111
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,680
more about that later from Nicole let's

112
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,030
talk about CSS cough actually hold on

113
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,290
let me get a little bit more specific

114
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,890
let's talk about CSS cough EU it's the

115
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,390
first of its type it's I think is far

116
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,220
neither the only of its type it is for

117
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,720
the organizers is their first conference

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,190
and I'm sure you know what that means it

119
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,850
is in child index one so of all the

120
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,800
children's like the index is one or as

121
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,750
some of you would say the index is one

122
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,380
so yeah C's economy you it's uh it's

123
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,900
it's not for profit right so there's no

124
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,220
margin they don't make any margin on

125
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,690
this hopefully when they're done there

126
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,080
will be nothing left I assume what I

127
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,820
hope is not the case that they actually

128
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,680
have extra money and they just hide it

129
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,200
so let's hope that that is not happening

130
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,580
let's talk about the list of the

131
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,410
speakers we have excellent speakers

132
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,440
they're in the top 1% of their field

133
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,940
they are the backgrounds are really

134
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,980
really badass you would all say

135
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,510
absolutely badass so if during while

136
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,680
you're listening these speakers if you

137
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,060
are unable to focus next we have a

138
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,230
selection of delicious black coffee but

139
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,520
I've heard unfortunately we have is your

140
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,610
decaf which you know if you're not a

141
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,770
caffeine person is bad bad but let me

142
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,790
give you some background on that

143
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,400
apparently the organizers asked them to

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,110
do decaf and all they said was nine nine

145
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,300
nine nine nine nine and then just know

146
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,880
decaf so I realized that's a lot of

147
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,350
background jokes in a row so I'm just

148
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,060
gonna turn off repeat on the background

149
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,390
joke sorry about that it's last one also

150
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,860
mention the toilet

151
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,060
if you need directions ask me later

152
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,670
and once you so if you have to drink

153
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,710
less coughing you have to pee after you

154
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,470
visit the toilet and you're empty of pee

155
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,950
everything for your will be fixed

156
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,950
everything will be alright so definitely

157
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,840
give that a visit I want to talk we have

158
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,970
this policy they mentioned it's the anti

159
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,830
jerk policy so I just want to give you

160
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,750
in the in the context of CSS what that

161
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,350
entails so take this pretty seriously

162
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,850
don't disable user selection on all

163
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,880
elements that's kind of douchey don't

164
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,890
ever every seven images don't rotate

165
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,510
them 180 degrees like that's pretty

166
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:24,340
douchey don't fade all the paragraphs to

167
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,470
zero like I can't see them after 500

168
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,670
seconds like don't do that that would be

169
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,860
a jerky thing to do and finally don't

170
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,780
blink all of your H ones all right so

171
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,130
just doesn't God just don't do that

172
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,570
stuff that would be a definitely fall

173
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,600
under the jerk policy one more point I

174
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,790
want to make it's a I'm sorry one point

175
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,830
I guess it would be a pretty important

176
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,800
point I want to talk about if you guys

177
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,390
take photos or of anything

178
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,910
totally totally cool but I would love if

179
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,470
you guys could share them you can just

180
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,150
you can display them online if you want

181
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,980
