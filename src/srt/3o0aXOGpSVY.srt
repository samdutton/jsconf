1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,000

so this is going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,700
crazy talk I've had seven espressos this

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,189
morning if I can get my hands stop

4
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,660
jittering it'll be even better all right

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,720
so uh fuck cyberspace let's do it live

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,579
this is seriously the live part of the

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,829
live action because it's live I just did

8
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,870
the slides up there two minutes ago this

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,280
is going to be live I have a cow to

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,160
prove that it is actually alive see this

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,800
for all those who weren't listening only

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,730
in Portland does that happen so in order

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,840
to get you acquainted with what I'm

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,789
about to talk about I need everyone to

15
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,890
close their eyes and think back to their

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,930
days back in the early 90s everyone

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,670
please just close your eyes please don't

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,930
put your fork into your mouth when you

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,699
close your eyes but just close your eyes

20
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:20,430
come on do it do it try it try

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,550
how many of you grew up to those

22
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:28,070
beautiful beautiful beautiful sounds how

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,650
many of you secretly at night maybe put

24
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,759
it on just to go to bed good i see some

25
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:42,530
like-minded individuals here so i'm here

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,150
to make a proposition that not a lot of

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,380
people are gonna like it's that the

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,390
internet sucks all of its parallel

29
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,610
computations concurrency all this other

30
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,009
stuff happening all the same time forget

31
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,720
that that stuff sucks I mean we're all

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,640
at no DJ s nothing happens all at the

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,660
same time right no okay I do want to

34
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,280
make a comment on that hit when mono

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,259
multi and Tyler are crawling on rooftops

36
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:04,910
that's when the Internet's awesome let's

37
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,020
give them a round of applause really

38
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,709
quick but seriously though I do miss AOL

39
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,810
I miss those days when we had PBS's and

40
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,519
you know you always get that wing sock

41
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:20,930
dll error at the wrong time i talked to

42
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,670
a lot of people nowadays and and it's

43
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,470
funny some of the means that lived and

44
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,630
existed like hey man what's your baud

45
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,510
rate I've got 5,600 on this oh I'm

46
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,720
rocking the hard speed of a 56k modem

47
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,930
whoo we need to bring those days back

48
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,400
and it's actually unfortunate that a lot

49
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,290
of people don't know how to utilize a

50
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,360
serial port I mean how many of you have

51
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,950
eight how many of you have a serial port

52
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,299
on your computer right now raise your

53
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:48,380
hand point moving what do you think the

54
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,840
S&C r USB is it's for cereal all right

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,730
so we have all these serial connections

56
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,500
we don't use them as developers and what

57
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,790
I'm here to tell you about is that you

58
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,230
can use them as developers and you can

59
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,549
use them just as easily as if you were

60
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,370
to write a socket i/o client and that's

61
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,049
why I decided to write a library for it

62
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,510
to help people build the Death Star do

63
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,400
you guys know what the Death Star is let

64
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,960
me show you

65
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,220
continue with the operation you may fire

66
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:27,160
when ready

67
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,310
that's right you know it never works

68
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,350
when you want it to

69
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,920
so the Death Star was a very very

70
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,330
complicated machine that was designed

71
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,460
for a single purpose of destroying stars

72
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,280
so obviously with that intent you would

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,380
need five different buttons to hit in

74
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,330
order to get the laser to work this is

75
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,940
very much how serial port code works and

76
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,020
that's part of the reason why most

77
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,640
people don't write serial port code

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,930
anymore you have to deal with things

79
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,270
like software flow control hardware flow

80
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,630
control baud rates retries potentially

81
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,890
if you're going out of further wire what

82
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,660
happens if the packet gets messed up

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,980
it's also why a lot of people don't

84
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,020
write tcp code at low levels but you

85
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,760
know what I like writing code at low

86
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,380
levels I think Ryan also likes writing

87
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,750
code at low levels sometimes so let's

88
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,160
get back to the slides and I took it

89
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,830
down so what I'm here to say is don't

90
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,780
call this a comeback people have been

91
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,310
doing this stuff for decades and decades

92
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,930
and they're still doing it in back

93
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,720
offices in the basement and you know

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,420
it's fun it's a lot of fun in fact right

95
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,980
now is a great time to be doing this I

96
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,120
don't know if you've been upstairs yet

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,980
we have the cool little arduino starter

98
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,710
kits up there they allow people like us

99
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,330
who may or may not have had a lot of

100
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,610
hardware formal training to do things

101
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,200
with hardware but in order to get access

102
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,970
to these you have to do serial code and

103
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,120
up until now nodejs developers are not

104
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,580
JavaScript developers web people have

105
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,190
not had access to that communication I

106
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,230
built the library that allows you to

107
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,970
talk directly to these devices through

108
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,450
nodejs so please oh the one this is the

109
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,730
one person who is used it let's give him

110
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:09,030
a round of applause I built it

111
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,800
personally not for arduino although that

112
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,330
wasn't nice side effect that I didn't

113
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,730
plan on I built it for other things like

114
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,000
x10 z-wave zigbee these are things that

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,010
you can put around the house and I was

116
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,330
going to turn off all the lights but we

117
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,470
were afraid we might not get them back

118
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,100
on it if you don't know what those

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,770
protocols are go home and research them

120
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,510
they are awesome what you get is you get

121
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,670
a little USB stick you can use the

122
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,930
serial port code to push down

123
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,180
information like turn all my house

124
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,510
lights on wind door opens shut dogs door

125
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,200
when a car comes in turn on no lights in

126
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,630
house it's a beautiful

127
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,800
full thing Nikolai are you here the

128
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,650
dream is alive in Portland Nikolai had

129
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,020
this theory of taking jquery style

130
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,240
syntax and saying instead of a document

131
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,640
object make it a house object and then

132
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,220
flow down from there with this code you

133
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,600
can do that other things like rack

134
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
server monitoring your car with this you

135
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,950
can actually program your car in

136
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,400
JavaScript I might be the only one who

137
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,690
gets giddy about that but I'm kind of

138
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,810
excited and mobile devices the the

139
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,040
beauty of a mobile device is everyone

140
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,420
talks about how advanced they are they

141
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,660
still run on serial ports so here's

142
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,850
where the package is go play with enjoy

143
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,650
and if you want you can go upstairs and

144
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,180
we can play with it together it's a

145
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,040
great great thing it's a fun fun world

146
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,830
and everything just happens one after
