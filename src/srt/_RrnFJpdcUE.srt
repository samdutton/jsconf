my name is andreas scholl I live in

2
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,240
California and a mozilla chief

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,130
technology officer

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,109
I'm responsible for missoula's

5
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,570
technology roadmap and overall all the

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,239
technologies that we do at Mozilla

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:27,570
missoula is the place that really gave

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,099
birth to javascript through been denied

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,009
or former CTO who invented a JavaScript

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,110
language if you look at the history of

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,010
JavaScript over the last many years it's

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,329
still the case that essentially with

13
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,540
every year the new tools and the new

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,579
technology is available in JavaScript

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,949
and through JavaScript are accelerating

16
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:48,839
there's more more things we can do with

17
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:50,820
JavaScript and we are also seeing a very

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,439
healthy addition of new language

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,360
features sue sanitization and we're very

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,519
excited about that I've not been in more

21
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:59,580
size before so this is actually my first

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,890
time en w'en Osiris and also in

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,140
Argentina I've traveled to pretty much

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,049
every part of Latin America except

25
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,079
Argentina because missoula has been

26
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,600
launching since last year Firefox OS all

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,689
over Latin America and in Argentina is

28
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,610
the last place where we launch Firefox

29
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,890
OS so I was didn't have the opportunity

30
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,530
so far to come here but I'm very happy

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,179
that I finally had the chance to do so

32
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:26,369
yesterday I had for the first time the

33
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,859
opportunity to eat steak here in

34
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:31,200
Argentina so I had steak in Brazil and

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,380
here in Argentina but I only tried one

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,789
restaurant so I think I have to try a

37
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:37,590
couple more before I can decide where it

38
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,579
is better I talked here about j2me jas

39
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,950
which is a java virtual machine written

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,439
in JavaScript we're using this Java VM

41
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,689
to run feature phone applications on

42
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,729
firefox OS I think it's great I have

43
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,709
attended quite a few JS comps in the

44
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,899
past before even though it's the first

45
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,579
time for me in Argentina but it's really

46
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,170
great there's a lot of people and a lot

47
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,240
of very interesting talks and I'm

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,219
particularly excited that I get to give

49
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,709
a keynote together with Brendan so that

50
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,149
that's a very special occasion we have

51
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:07,770
never done that before that we are

52
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,240
basically back-to-back keynotes between
