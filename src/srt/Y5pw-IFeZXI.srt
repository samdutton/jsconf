1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:21,420

you

2
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,670
I will talk to you guys about getting

3
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:30,070
rid of the keyboard so basically this

4
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,239
here is my view of the world all right I

5
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,700
don't like keyboards much keyboards have

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,830
got too many keys keyboard means i have

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,809
to like stand over here and type on my

8
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:42,670
machine i have to be like this close to

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,100
the screen when i play with a keyboard i

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,960
have to have a flat surface to rest the

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,030
keyboard i kind of balance it on my knee

12
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,600
which is a bit annoying and the worst

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,460
thing about keyboards is they tend to

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,440
come with a mouse don't like my see that

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,730
and when you want to play games you want

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,110
to be relaxed right you want to have fun

17
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,070
you don't really want to sit like

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,550
slouched over your desk and like we got

19
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,869
loose little mouse and play the keys

20
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,520
like that you know you want you want to

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,600
lean back you want to be on your couch

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,890
you want to be on a beanbag so just to

23
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,590
like reinforce this message this is my

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,509
view of the world keyboards are good no

25
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:21,759
wait here the other way around keyboards

26
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,440
are bad game pads are good but given

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,729
this is jamias confirm were all

28
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:31,150
JavaScript developers we are mostly

29
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,510
stuck in the browser and in the browser

30
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,560
we are mostly stuck with the old

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,420
keyboard mouse combination that's the

32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,860
only thing the browser kind of exposures

33
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,290
to us and yes some of us might play with

34
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,030
node and like have access to everything

35
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,750
that the operating system can offer but

36
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,340
that's not too many of us some of us

37
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,990
might you know kind of start thinking a

38
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,240
little about about touch events cuz that

39
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,400
working on mobile devices and you know

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,979
they got no keyboards no mouse or at

41
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,810
least no mouse and and they kind of use

42
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,310
the finger like a sort of substitute

43
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,880
mouse but what I want to be talking

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,790
about is this like brand new and quite

45
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,680
exciting bit of technology that's going

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,060
to let you step away from your computer

47
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,340
step away from the keyboard and start

48
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,100
using one of these things and it's

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,380
called the gamepad API and I'm very sad

50
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,239
about it so the gamepad API is a tiny

51
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,750
little new thing a new spec that

52
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,079
basically will expose any game

53
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,930
controller that the operating system

54
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,260
wrecking

55
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,360
Isis through to your browser it came out

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,299
I think the first browser that had it

57
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,640
was chrome last year in August last year

58
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,799
chrome 21 came out and it had support

59
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:50,290
for the gamepad API since then it's

60
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,239
moved out of experimental it's now

61
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,280
implemented in chrome it's implemented

62
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,879
in Firefox it is a w3c working draft

63
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,099
which means that it still has a good way

64
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,620
to go before become standard but it's

65
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,120
far enough along that it's no longer

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,739
just experimental it's something is

67
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:09,970
going to happen we're going to see it

68
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,500
it's going to happen and what you get

69
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,430
out of the gamepad object basically

70
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,639
looks a bit like this excuse me so it's

71
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,090
got just a few properties really it's

72
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,209
got an ID that identify it my controller

73
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,760
here is saying I'm a standard gamepad

74
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,430
from this vendor it's this product I'm

75
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,049
sure there's a list of those vendor and

76
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:42,340
product code somewhere I couldn't find

77
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,790
it then it's got an index you can

78
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,230
actually hook up multiple gamepads your

79
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,519
browser will recognize multiple gamepad

80
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,379
so you know if I could clone myself and

81
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,000
the controller I could like play against

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,840
myself on the other side of the machine

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,459
it's got a time stamp which tells you

84
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,180
something about when it was last updated

85
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,190
and then the rest is basic telling you

86
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,870
what state to the gamepad is it's got

87
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,599
four axes which corresponds to the

88
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,500
sticks and it's got an array of 17

89
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,510
buttons which is basically everything

90
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,599
else and it's probably a little bit

91
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,870
easier to just visualize it like this so

92
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,949
the buttons you can push the buttons

93
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:31,030
lots of buttons you can push multiple

94
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,919
buttons at the same time it'll register

95
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,380
that you also got access to these

96
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,169
control buttons in the middle and with

97
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:39,669
the sticks you can sort of move things

98
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:42,460
up and down back and forth you can use

99
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,070
both sticks and

100
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,870
it's really actually quite easy to set

101
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,099
up if you have quick look at some code

102
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:59,870
here it's not big enough can you see it

103
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,659
yep cool so the first step is to get the

104
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:09,270
connection to the gamepad this is

105
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,789
currently not a standard so it's not

106
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:13,620
currently implemented exactly the same

107
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,460
in oh hang on a skip the slide in though

108
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,440
does that skipped forward backwards a

109
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,500
little bit it's a little bit of a bug

110
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,340
anyway let's have a little bit of a look

111
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,870
at browser compatibility before we move

112
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,599
to the actual code itself so I was

113
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:32,569
saying this is not quite standard yet

114
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,240
it's a little bit flaky and safari and

115
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,669
Internet Explorer I are both just out of

116
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:40,680
the picture on this they don't have it

117
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,900
implemented from what I've seen there's

118
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,669
no immediate plans to implement any of

119
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,439
it it's a matrix here because it's not

120
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,889
just the browser the online operating

121
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,900
system has to have support for the

122
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,819
device that you're plugging in with

123
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,349
keyboards it's almost ubiquitous you

124
00:05:58,349 --> 00:05:59,430
can't really you don't really have

125
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,870
keyboards anymore that you need to

126
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,029
install drivers for you know back in the

127
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,650
day when you bought a new fancy keyboard

128
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,969
you actually had to install the driver

129
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:07,349
for it now the operating systems just

130
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,449
like yeah I know that thing it's got a

131
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,940
lot of buttons on it with these things

132
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,129
we're not quite there yet windows is

133
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:16,229
actually the system that recognizes the

134
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:19,379
most amount of gaming devices basically

135
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,870
because Windows is the primary gaming

136
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:29,009
platform for pc it's bit sad OSX as you

137
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,599
may have been able to tell from the

138
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,969
slightly delayed president's

139
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:36,330
presentation is a bit wobbly and kind of

140
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,069
flaky this controller here is using some

141
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,199
xbox controller driver that some guy I

142
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,849
hacked in his basement about two years

143
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,349
ago and haven't really bothered with

144
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,479
sins and that was the best thing I could

145
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,370
find to hook an xbox controller up to

146
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,639
the OS X so if you think of doing this

147
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,370
maybe windows this is the way to go

148
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,430
the support is about as good in Chrome

149
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:08,910
as it is in Firefox there's a lot of

150
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,470
different implications which will have a

151
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,040
look at in in a second on Linux there's

152
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,780
been some issues with buttons being

153
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,870
mapped wrong so you know you press a and

154
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,210
you get and y or your wiggle one

155
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,530
joystick and it registers and the other

156
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,290
one but yeah you best the best that is

157
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:34,710
windows with chrome or firefox so if you

158
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,140
go to step one here of getting the

159
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,400
connected gamepad like I said the

160
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,920
implementation is not locked down yet

161
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,870
the specs s that you need to expose to

162
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,020
events a connected event in a disconnect

163
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,900
event and this is how Firefox dusting

164
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,210
right it adds an event Lisa and license

165
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,540
to the Kinect event then you add a

166
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,510
handle to it and you get the gamepad

167
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,280
object off the event in chrome you have

168
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,810
to do it slightly differently in chrome

169
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,420
you have to ask a navigator object for

170
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,210
your game pads and then it'll be the

171
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,420
first game pad in that array hopefully

172
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,850
if you have more than one game pad

173
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:22,590
you'll have multiple game pats there the

174
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,860
second step is to start scheduling

175
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,010
polling for your gamepad so it doesn't

176
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,540
actually give you any vents when

177
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,580
anything's pressed right when you push a

178
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,770
button nothing really happens except

179
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,680
that the state changes the time step up

180
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,710
that time stamp updates but you have to

181
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,470
pull it and a good way of doing this is

182
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,440
requestanimationframe happily the same

183
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,180
browsers that support animation frames

184
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,190
are also supporting gamepad API so you

185
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,550
won't have any problems there and for

186
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,230
those who don't know what a animation

187
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,840
frame is it's basically their browser

188
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,240
running a loop for you and forcing that

189
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,660
loop when your tab loses focus which is

190
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,730
nice other ways you kind of chew through

191
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,329
battery like it's going out of fashion

192
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:15,799
slightly slightly different in chrome

193
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:21,709
and firefox here in chrome you just ask

194
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,349
the window for an animation frame and in

195
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:27,589
firefox it's a moss request guess they

196
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:36,699
want to be special so step three profit

197
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:40,339
this is where basically you check the

198
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,959
time stamping as a previous time step if

199
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,359
that time stamp has been updated that

200
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,399
means that the controller changed the

201
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,869
state has changed something has been

202
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:52,579
pushed and so yeah you can now do some

203
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:53,929
stuff whatever you want to do with those

204
00:09:53,929 --> 00:10:04,249
events bit flaky so this isn't this

205
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:06,439
isn't just a gimmick though right this

206
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,239
isn't just something that were like muck

207
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:10,819
about and make little dots move across

208
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:16,549
the screen this is my friend Magda don't

209
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,669
know if anyone reads Japanese here Jed

210
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:23,539
reads Japanese is here anyway this this

211
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,519
is my friend magna from a hiking trip we

212
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,809
took last year she's holding up this

213
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,939
piece of paper saying you know very

214
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:31,039
politely requesting that we do not walk

215
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,019
on the marked paths because on the mark

216
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:35,659
paths there are beers and they will eat

217
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:39,709
us so she's Australian and she's the

218
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:40,969
kind of girl that you know she attracts

219
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:43,549
dangerous animals and being Australian

220
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,259
and living in Australian and being like

221
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,929
an animal a dangerous animal attractor

222
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:52,579
is really bad idea so about ten years

223
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:54,229
ago she got her are mostly chewed off by

224
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:58,249
a shark and that kind of kills your

225
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,399
gaming life kiss you're stuck with like

226
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,229
one left arm which is not your primary

227
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,409
hand and then this kind of like slightly

228
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:08,299
wobbly right down that you can't really

229
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,699
use for much um and suddenly you can

230
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:12,709
normally play any first-person shooters

231
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:16,069
whatsoever alright they all require you

232
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:18,709
to have like two hands on the keyboard

233
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:22,970
mouse you know clicking fast and there's

234
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,570
all these games that you can't

235
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,900
she can't play also because the

236
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,390
controllers aren't mapped out you can't

237
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,310
you can't change the controls around you

238
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,840
just you just stuck with whatever the

239
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,480
game developer gave you there's a bunch

240
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,810
of things that has been done to actually

241
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,960
improve accessibility for people with

242
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,780
some sort of disabled disablement or

243
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,090
disability and a lot of these things

244
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,790
actually came out after the wars in Iraq

245
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,700
and Afghanistan started happening people

246
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,950
soldiers mostly 18 to 35 year olds males

247
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,590
white not too much disposable income

248
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,470
your primary gaming demographic they

249
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,960
came home with bits missing and so I

250
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,600
suddenly became like a bit sexy to do

251
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,890
all these things to like help people

252
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,180
with disabilities you know do more

253
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,240
gaming and stuff but for those of us

254
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,350
we've been building games in the browser

255
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,180
just we haven't been doing this at all

256
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,990
right and this is something that that is

257
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,200
actually quite easy to change I showed

258
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,430
you how to set up with the gamepad

259
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,900
before I showed you how to start just

260
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,880
listening to the gamepad or you can

261
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,670
quite easily do it's actually to start

262
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,590
doing stuff like this all right you can

263
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,980
start playing games oh I'm really bad at

264
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,320
it first when I'm also talking we can

265
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,700
start playing game this is this is

266
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,770
actually just an open-source JavaScript

267
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,930
imitation Tetris and all I've done is

268
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,900
like tape get just it's exposed to the

269
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,150
events so it exposes the methods that

270
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,370
you need to call to you know move

271
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,030
something a turn something and so i just

272
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,880
added a little bit of gamepad api

273
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,270
goodness do this and i cannot start

274
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,360
playing this with one hand you couldn't

275
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,340
do that before this is Tetris it's got

276
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,050
all four controls right it's got right

277
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,700
left turn down and those four controls

278
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,800
you can find out with like a finger

279
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,540
missing even but they were mapped to

280
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,560
three keys on that side of the keyboard

281
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,950
and one key on that side of the keyboard

282
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,060
all right the other good thing about

283
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,130
this is they give

284
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,710
one hand need like Jesus if you have the

285
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:45,910
second hand and it's really quite

286
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,830
straightforward to to hook up to I've

287
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,730
done the same thing with the

288
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,200
presentation framework that I'm using

289
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,690
here using something called bespoke j/s

290
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,150
which spaces itself on on touch events

291
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,010
and key events and it's quite easy right

292
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,810
because again it exposes the methods

293
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,920
that you need to cause all you need to

294
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,890
do is like put some little gamepad API

295
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,710
script in there and call tetras right or

296
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,600
Tetris left you know you might notice

297
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,040
that I'm using thresholds instead of

298
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,800
discrete values and that bit of co there

299
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,290
that's because the values you get from

300
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,390
these are sometimes a little bit dirty

301
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,730
so with the access for example it's a

302
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,320
floating point number when you get it

303
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,930
back and even if it's like completely

304
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,130
neutral like now I'm not touching

305
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,680
anything you'll still say that it's like

306
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,690
zero point zero zero one zero zero

307
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,300
because these things are still plastic

308
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,130
and not that precise but it's not just

309
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,000
about you know it's not just about games

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,970
and so just but presentation framework

311
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,820
game pads are part of something that we

312
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,090
can we can start thinking more about how

313
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,860
we let users interact with the things

314
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,320
that we built we're talking about these

315
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,850
things at the moment we're doing we're

316
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,040
doing responsive design right we know

317
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,020
that some devices are sure then some are

318
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,180
wide and some at all sometimes we have a

319
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,680
lot of screen space sometimes given

320
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,030
little so we gave responsive design

321
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,400
that's cool and we go progressive

322
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,260
enhancement because we know that some

323
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,030
browsers a and some rails are great

324
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,360
something some browsers have really

325
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,010
exciting features and some browsers

326
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,650
don't really have features and I think

327
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,850
this is one of those things that should

328
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,890
feed into that philosophy a little bit

329
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,270
right we need some sort of like

330
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,250
progressive enhancement for input

331
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,770
devices because it's really not that

332
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:43,160
hard to basically set up a PlayStation

333
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,440
drum pad hook it up it's a gamepad hook

334
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,150
it up to your browser

335
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,520
and then start playing the newspaper all

336
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,840
right go left article right article you

337
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,240
know use the pedal to scroll get a

338
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,180
workout with your breakfast or you know

339
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,920
allow people to remap there is some

340
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,570
single thing that they do every way they

341
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,530
interact with your silly little blog so

342
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,760
that they can use whatever input device

343
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,140
they want to we're going to get more of

344
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,420
this and I think it's going to be really

345
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,190
really exciting and I think you should

346
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:27,260
start playing with it today thank you

347
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,810
all right all right I think we can open

348
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:38,620
up for some questions okay Oh again

349
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,650
you're gonna make me do this like for

350
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,050
every talk aren't you you first all

351
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,710
right Remy Thanks um do you have any

352
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,290
idea what the like handheld console

353
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,600
support is like for the gamepad API II

354
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,720
like the d/s has a gamepad that has a

355
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,420
browser yeah do can you comment on

356
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,790
whether any way any of them have the

357
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,440
gamepad API and whether they may use

358
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,780
that kind of thing and or if it just

359
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,550
defaults to the mouse I'm assuming most

360
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,650
than the old ones to force the mouse but

361
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,820
I wonder if any of them actually support

362
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,310
the gamepad API in the first place

363
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,410
things like the des are natively built

364
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,390
to to work with the buttons that are

365
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,459
there I don't think they use the gamepad

366
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,220
API it's not ready yet I think they use

367
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,070
some sort of Shem that they already have

368
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:32,030
but I'm not sure all right next question

369
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:36,200
hi there as you're based in the UK um

370
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,880
over here hey hi and have you had any

371
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,950
feelings with special effect who are

372
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,040
based up in the Midlands of the UK

373
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,890
because they deal a lot with interfacing

374
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,790
for disability or would you be

375
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,310
interested in maybe talking to them at

376
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,200
some point in the future I'm often gonna

377
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,900
be super cool to talk to them I hadn't

378
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,190
really thought about this until I found

379
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,020
myself at like three friends who's all

380
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,170
short one arm and they're all gamers or

381
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,640
maybe the exception if my grandmother

382
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,520
she's more of a biped what's that but

383
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,650
yeah that'd be really cool I'll take you

384
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,370
out the details and said mighty cool so

385
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,320
we've got time for another question

386
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,620
anybody else know ok well 10 my thirties

387
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,240
jet got it ok sort of in the middle on

388
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,130
it he's closer I got it okay Jed

389
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,020
prancing through the audience well

390
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,790
there's just more about the movement of

391
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,920
these input devices because I don't

392
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,520
really see keyboards are much too

393
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,620
fenton game pets and I see the

394
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,100
tendencies are that the input devices

395
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,230
we're using now are more the input

396
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,600
devices we are born with with touch and

397
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,550
movement with the leap motion and always

398
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,920
control it's still early stages but is

399
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,050
this something you believe that will be

400
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,380
like it may be interesting for gamers on

401
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,030
an xbox that they can navigate your blog

402
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,700
but for most people is it really useful

403
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,690
like and with the tendencies so I see

404
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,730
the gamepad API as it stands now it's

405
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,310
it's a beginning I think what we're

406
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,890
going to get is basically a future where

407
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,070
there are multiple manifold ways of

408
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,890
interacting with the browser and that

409
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,450
you'll be able to hook up you know

410
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,660
motion controller typical gamepads

411
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,770
gamepads that you'll wave around just

412
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,480
your hands leap motion all that sort of

413
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,350
stuff and I think it's now that we need

414
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,760
to start thinking about that kind of

415
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,470
progressive enhancement off of the way

416
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,130
we deal with input devices so no I don't

417
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,810
think damn pads are going to be like the

418
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,880
entire future of the interweb but I

419
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,990
think it's one of the things that's

420
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,210
really exciting right now and it points

421
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,760
in a direction that is really exciting

422
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,390
as well okay everybody give a round of

423
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,640
applause for an X thank you

424
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:05,390
you
