1
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,040

good morning who's ready to talk about

2
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,100
feelings I'm just kidding actually I'm

3
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,330
not we're totally gonna talk about

4
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,600
feelings right now so as you know my

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,730
name is Jen and I'm here to talk to you

6
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,920
about emotional safety so let's start

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,010
doing that so what is emotional safety

8
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,049
well I think that's a terrible question

9
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:08,170
I mean to ask that question presupposes

10
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,600
that in a room of maybe the smartest

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,329
most talented technologists gathered at

12
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,999
this very moment that they don't

13
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:18,509
understand why the way a person feels

14
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,859
wouldn't be important while they're at

15
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:24,159
work but the way a person feels doesn't

16
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,460
have any sort of impact on their work

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,380
could that be true

18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,969
well statistics tell us a story

19
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,659
according to the World Health

20
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,649
Organization in 2012 so two years ago

21
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:40,840
the leading causes of death in high to

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,850
upper middle income countries so think

23
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,999
like here in the US and in the EU the

24
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:47,469
leading causes of death were heart

25
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:50,560
disease stroke and chronic obstructive

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,350
pulmonary disease or COPD so that's

27
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,179
things like chronic bronchitis or

28
00:01:55,179 --> 00:02:03,459
emphysema in 2012 265 thousand people

29
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:09,200
died from heart attacks or heart disease

30
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,670
221 thousand people died from strokes

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,540
and 81 thousand people died from

32
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,260
the OPD contributing factors to most of

33
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,780
these preventable conditions were things

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,989
like high blood pressure high

35
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,319
cholesterol diabetes conditions in which

36
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,010
stress can be a major contributor and in

37
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,310
2012 over half a million people lost

38
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,620
their lives because of it and that might

39
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,329
not seem like a lot of people but think

40
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,180
about it in this way that's the same as

41
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,010
nearly everyone in the city of Portland

42
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:56,819
dying within a year just one year how

43
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,409
can this be you're asking yourself right

44
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,470
now surely the stress that those people

45
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,419
experience in their jobs is not the one

46
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,780
that I experienced in mine they must be

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,980
like crazy

48
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,099
Oprah levels of busy and overwhelmed and

49
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,569
stressed out to the complete max that

50
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,639
could be but I think it's far more

51
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,169
likely that the stresses they are

52
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,889
experiencing are the same that are now

53
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,409
considered to be normal work stress

54
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:29,099
experiences explain this to me Jen

55
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,739
you're saying well okay that's totally

56
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,659
why I'm here so welcome to the polyvagal

57
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,150
theory don't worry it's a quick trip oh

58
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,920
wait a second

59
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:52,119
this is gonna make it more official oh

60
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:58,010
no I knew this was gonna happen okay

61
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,159
feeling official let's take a look Oh

62
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:05,980
gross

63
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,879
oh so basically in the polyvagal system

64
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,819
your autonomous nervous system or I'm

65
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,530
gonna call it the ANS because I totally

66
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,750
love abbrevs

67
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,220
it's the system that's taking in all of

68
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,870
the stimulus that you're experiencing

69
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,180
right now it controls a lot of the

70
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,620
things that you're doing automatically

71
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,380
get it autonomic automatic okay so it's

72
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,250
controlling the things you're doing

73
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,500
automatically like breathing or blinking

74
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,300
without you even thinking and this

75
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,460
involuntary support system is a

76
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,479
wonderful feature of the human body

77
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,030
however one of its central bosses is

78
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,830
this vagus nerve that's part of your

79
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,479
brainstem like I know it's gross and

80
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:50,979
it's connected to all of your crucial

81
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:54,310
inner element elem inner elements like

82
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,930
your heart and respiratory and

83
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,279
gastrointestinal tracts all those guys

84
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:03,699
the polyvagal theory suggests that the

85
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,470
vagus nerve triggers these crucial

86
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,660
systems in three different ways

87
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,300
via information gleaned by your ANS

88
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,570
without your control or your knowing

89
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,260
you've all heard a fight-or-flight

90
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,080
before right those survival type

91
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,690
instincts well your ANS is constantly

92
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,940
scanning your environment all around you

93
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,010
to determine what your current mode of

94
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,240
survival should be there are three modes

95
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,190
of survival safety danger and too late

96
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,130
basically just kidding the last one is

97
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,169
life throw you guys can see that so

98
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:41,889
let's talk about safety mode when your

99
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:43,120
nervous system determines that you are

100
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,160
safe you are operating at your body's

101
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,639
optimum mental and emotional levels your

102
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,820
ANS goes into rest and digest mode which

103
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,500
basically means that it's operating at

104
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,090
its full capacity so that you don't have

105
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,789
to consciously think about how on all of

106
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,900
your systems are they just are this is

107
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,580
the level that you want to be at to do

108
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,860
your best work all of your work danger

109
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,470
mode it's not really as cool as it

110
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,380
sounds when you're exposed to danger

111
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,150
unconsciously your body goes into

112
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,210
hyperdrive your heart rate increases

113
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,210
your ANS jumps into action and it limits

114
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,740
the rest of your systems ability in

115
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,020
order to keenly focus on the danger and

116
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,090
to do this it floods your system with

117
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,220
norepinephrine which is a fun hormone

118
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,300
that causes vigilant concentration

119
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,340
additionally in danger mode you're more

120
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,160
prone to unexpected bouts of rage or

121
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,370
panic and this is the fight or flight of

122
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,949
the fight-or-flight impulse and it's all

123
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:46,870
happening subconsciously but your body

124
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,669
is preparing you for one of those two

125
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:55,389
outcomes and last life threat mode when

126
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,070
your ANS perceives a life threat it

127
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,919
shuts everything down your heartrate

128
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,740
actually decreases your muscles tense

129
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,770
and ready for action

130
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,560
that will most likely never come does

131
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
anybody hear experienced back or neck

132
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,699
pain from being stressed at work that's

133
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,590
the result of tension that never gets

134
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,590
discharged in life threat mode you can't

135
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,710
hear reason this is the freeze mode of

136
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,949
fight flight or freeze and based on the

137
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,720
information that the ANS is giving to

138
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,909
the vagus nerve your body is constantly

139
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,520
but unconsciously occupying one of those

140
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,479
three modes for example my body is

141
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,259
currently in danger mode although I can

142
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,270
be hyperbolic so it feels like life

143
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,009
threat mode right now

144
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:48,479
I'm like super close to shutting down so

145
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,659
why is any of this important well with

146
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,190
the knowledge of that mini biology

147
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:59,560
lesson how is it not which mode do you

148
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,639
think you're operating in right now what

149
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,020
about when you have an argument with

150
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,230
someone what mode does that look like

151
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,830
which mode are you operating in when you

152
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,039
get critical and really hard to hear but

153
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,539
absolutely necessary feedback which mode

154
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,070
are you operating in when you're in a

155
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,340
conflict about a really hard but

156
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,839
important decision recognizing what mode

157
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,710
you've been operating in is crucial

158
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,419
because spending a prolonged length of

159
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,370
time in danger mode or life threat mode

160
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,190
has serious physical and mental health

161
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,560
consequences so here's a list of some of

162
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,899
them and looking at that you're probably

163
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,029
thinking well those are some normal

164
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:55,900
reactions to stress Jen there's more

165
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,540
well things got a little bit worse

166
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,550
are you done identifying with any of

167
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,459
those when you think about work it's not

168
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,589
good

169
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,970
prolonged stress can even lead to drug

170
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,339
or alcohol abuse withdrawal from social

171
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,160
situations or most disturbingly in my

172
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,350
opinion the chronic suppression of your

173
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,330
immune system the very thing that's

174
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,880
intact to keep you safe protect your

175
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,860
body from harm your body will start to

176
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:29,070
suppress that this is important your

177
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,750
body craves safety this is not about me

178
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,630
being a woman or being in touch with my

179
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,000
feelings more than you are this is

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,750
biological and it is a fact that we are

181
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,040
killing ourselves with stress if safety

182
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,560
first is a thing you ever heard and not

183
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,230
it along to or believed this is

184
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,580
important to quote our intern Heather on

185
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,850
her first day at an yet happy smart

186
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,750
people are productive smart people you

187
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,110
cannot deny the existence or the

188
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,120
importance of your feelings and the

189
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,740
impact they have on your whole being

190
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,390
that's the person that you take to work

191
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,170
every day to do so as childish and

192
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,870
ignorant and it doesn't even make sense

193
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:24,630
who would even do that anyway oh that's

194
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,560
me but okay so I only did that for like

195
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,190
the first twenty nine years of my life

196
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,459
so not that long the difference between

197
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,010
the person that I was for those 29 years

198
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,140
and the person that I've worked so hard

199
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,710
to become over the last two

200
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,950
that I've come to truly believe that

201
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,130
everyone has value and everyone deserves

202
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,340
respect

203
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,670
because if I believe that I have value

204
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,140
and that I deserve respect I absolutely

205
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,240
have to believe that of the people

206
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,560
around me for it to be true about myself

207
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,590
people are the value added to everything

208
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,770
that you do you just have to be able to

209
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:20,370
see that and yet we say people first and

210
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,340
if you're lucky enough the types of

211
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,780
products and projects that you're

212
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,250
working on those will change but the

213
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,870
people that you work on those projects

214
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,310
and products with the clients that you

215
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,220
work with they might change too but they

216
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,920
might not regardless

217
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,630
people don't ever just go away I hate to

218
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,130
break it to you but you're actually

219
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,490
surrounded by people right now they're

220
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,490
all around you and they're all around

221
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,010
you and you're at work and at home and

222
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,550
people are they're kind of here to stay

223
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,060
and I think that emotional safety is

224
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,520
important because it's creating a space

225
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,230
for people to be safe to feel safe to be

226
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,510
people which I know that everyone here

227
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,030
is really cool but we are all we're all

228
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,920
people here still if you forgot every

229
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,630
person on your team actually every

230
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,100
person that you come into contact with

231
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,640
has an entire universe of contributions

232
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,700
just waiting inside of them think about

233
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,020
that how many universes are in this room

234
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:49,180
or on your team

235
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,920
but people will always be afraid to let

236
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,300
that out to take those steps if they

237
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,180
feel like they don't matter because they

238
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,920
don't feel safe so you're asking

239
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,100
yourself how can I have this emotional

240
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,450
safety thing now well how can you

241
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:17,330
achieve it it it can't be achieved so

242
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,980
that's the end of my talk thank you very

243
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:29,300
much I'm totally kidding emotional

244
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,810
safety can be something that is

245
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,510
respected it can be something that's

246
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,050
prioritized that's pointed to that's

247
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,720
discussed but I have to be clear that

248
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,250
emotional safety is not a destination

249
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,780
creating a safe place for your people to

250
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,210
be people it has to be a fluid thing

251
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,490
because I mean I'm not even going to

252
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,020
stand up here and and try to tell you

253
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,360
how fast things change especially people

254
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,130
I do have some advice for starting to

255
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,690
create a safer environment if you're

256
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,660
interested in that it's also worth

257
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,520
pointing out that emotional safety is

258
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,410
the responsibility of every single

259
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,750
person I'll get into this more in a

260
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,340
minute but I really want to emphasize

261
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,110
that it's truly a personal

262
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,400
responsibility but I think more

263
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,280
importantly leaders and I know you're

264
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,460
here you've taken up the mantle of

265
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,670
leading people like it or not creating

266
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,020
emotional safety is your responsibility

267
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,700
people right now they could be sitting

268
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,370
at the same table as you they're looking

269
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,920
to you to show them that they can be

270
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,440
safe with you they just need to see it

271
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,510
to believe it

272
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,450
don't keep them waiting you will not

273
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,170
regret it

274
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,030
it will improve the health of your team

275
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,339
tenfold I can guarantee it

276
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:56,420
I have seen it I have lived it I know

277
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,010
that there are many of you who didn't

278
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,560
set out to be leaders and hearing this

279
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,579
just adds to the list of things that are

280
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,910
already frustrating you I get

281
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,069
discouraged too quite easily when I

282
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:11,579
discover the limits of my understanding

283
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,079
about what it means for me to lead if

284
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,540
you are a people first person if you

285
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,369
find yourself shying away from leading

286
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:22,009
because of the challenges it presents

287
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:25,129
because of so many unanswered questions

288
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:29,579
than we need you I'm a person who cares

289
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,679
about other people but I need

290
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,759
encouragement to keep leading if you

291
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,309
feel like you need encouragement too or

292
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:40,110
you feel like you have some to offer

293
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,319
please check this out my team at Andy

294
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,149
and I are going to very soon announce a

295
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,579
new endeavor called leadership II it's

296
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,769
early and I can't say much more than

297
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,290
what I've already said now but if these

298
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,999
feelings I'm describing resonate with

299
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:56,399
you then we really need you so go to

300
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,299
leadership be calm to check that out and

301
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:02,519
if you're not a leader or you work alone

302
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,339
I think emotional safety is still worth

303
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,839
paying attention to because it will

304
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,309
improve the quality of your

305
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:10,290
relationships working or otherwise and

306
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,249
the quality of your life and it's

307
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:15,749
something you should expect from your

308
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:21,480
leaders so how to do this I'll tell you

309
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,529
guys where I started first and foremost

310
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:27,329
figuring out a way to understand and

311
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:30,449
identify your emotions is crucial from

312
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,799
what I hear it's like learning a

313
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,019
programming language I don't know any of

314
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,809
them what I did to start educating

315
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:40,199
myself was read I wanted to logically

316
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,879
understand these emotion things and

317
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,970
figure out what that meant for me a book

318
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,699
that I read that helped change my life

319
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,470
was called positive intelligence by

320
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,059
Sherrod she mean after that I started

321
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:57,720
going to counseling and who I said a

322
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,839
counseling stigma word but I think the

323
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,480
stigma of the girl that was feeling like

324
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,100
a crazy person every day at work and

325
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,720
couldn't manage your emotions and didn't

326
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,720
have the tools or the ability to have a

327
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,730
dialogue about what was going on I think

328
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,140
that's a way where stigma

329
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,929
than the person that passionately goes

330
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,670
after improving their mental health in

331
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,250
their situation so I'm comfortable with

332
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,220
that stigma and I think one of the most

333
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,540
important things you can do to educate

334
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,780
yourself is to start practicing having

335
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,330
uncomfortable conversations and I don't

336
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,480
mean that you're having conversations

337
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,820
with the intent to make someone feel

338
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:47,429
uncomfortable but emotional safety is

339
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:50,549
about being able to talk to people about

340
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:52,320
your emotions and if you don't know how

341
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,120
to do that you need to start practicing

342
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,820
having those conversations and I've done

343
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,040
that with my team trust was built as a

344
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,470
result of that so I would encourage you

345
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,820
to look into that reactions when I talk

346
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,799
about emotional safety people usually

347
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,510
feel like it will make the workplace

348
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,669
murky and that's absolutely false so

349
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,460
much of learning about mental health is

350
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,140
understanding the absolute necessity for

351
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,100
boundaries and learning to identify your

352
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,130
personal boundaries is key water

353
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,010
boundaries well I actually can't tell

354
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,480
you that because everybody is are

355
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,419
different but I can lead you in the

356
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,130
direction of a book by Henry cloud

357
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,660
called boundaries and this dude he knows

358
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,200
stuff so if you take one thing away from

359
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,970
this talk let it be the mention of this

360
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,970
book because this book will definitely

361
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,309
help you clarify but I'll give you a

362
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,200
couple of my boundaries that I've set

363
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,750
for an example the first one is that I

364
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,240
don't ever talk about anything related

365
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,690
to a sexual nature at work there's just

366
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,190
too much there that can offend people

367
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,809
and it's never ever never ever never

368
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:10,340
never never never ever worth it

369
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,720
another hard boundary that I've had to

370
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,790
set for myself is that if I'm leading a

371
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,570
group of my teammates I won't vent about

372
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,970
one of them to anybody else in that

373
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,390
group

374
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,900
and it can be hard to do I have learned

375
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,020
this by screwing it up so I know now

376
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,850
it's a valuable thing I've

377
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:36,090
I've set that boundary the last thing I

378
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,429
would suggest is learning to move toward

379
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,120
conflict and not in a way that's

380
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,120
aggressive or that you are wanting to

381
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,690
thrive off of conflict but moving toward

382
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,990
it with the intention to resolve the

383
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,270
intention to solve the problem and this

384
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,260
is maybe the hardest thing in the world

385
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,970
to do for me at least because it

386
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,890
requires putting your personal things

387
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,330
aside not being triggered by the

388
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,260
circumstances of the conflict

389
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,240
it requires learning to manage your

390
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,780
emotions recognizing what survival mode

391
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,600
you're in being able to take all of that

392
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,140
into account and be able to productively

393
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,960
and proactively work through the problem

394
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,049
that the conflict presents so obviously

395
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:33,450
there needs to be a plug for non-violent

396
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,679
communication here I added the end this

397
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,770
morning it said nonviolent communication

398
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,220
so dr. Marshall Rosenberg wrote this

399
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,200
wonderful book which essentially gives

400
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,960
you insight into conflict and a

401
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,070
framework for how to begin to

402
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,679
productively engage conflict and working

403
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,870
through it so I definitely recommend

404
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,850
checking the book but I want to give you

405
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:02,760
that framework as well so this is the

406
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,289
structure which is aimed at giving

407
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,390
people a template to express both their

408
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,820
feelings and their needs in a productive

409
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,900
way so I'll give you an example when I

410
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,640
see you take all of the credit for that

411
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,390
site I feel hurt because I worked on

412
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,150
that too and I need to feel like my can

413
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,390
my contribution was valued so can we

414
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,880
talk about this would be one way to

415
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,200
start having a conversation

416
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,470
good question I can tell you why I care

417
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:46,179
about this that is Mila and she is very

418
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,799
proud of her muscles and I want her to

419
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,980
be strong especially in all of the ways

420
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,100
that I am weak

421
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,059
I've been trying to demonstrate

422
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:59,950
principles and tools that I've been

423
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,970
learning to my five-year-old so that by

424
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,909
the time she is 29 she doesn't have to

425
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,500
do all the heavy lifting that I'm doing

426
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,809
now it will already be ingrained in her

427
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:13,630
and she'll be like a million light years

428
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,480
ahead of where I am in this moment I'll

429
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,380
be learning from her when she's my age

430
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,909
but I believe just as importantly

431
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:23,770
gaining a perspective on emotional

432
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:29,049
safety teaches you empathy emotional

433
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:31,149
researchers generally define empathy is

434
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,159
the ability to sense other people's

435
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:35,440
emotions coupled with the ability to

436
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,630
imagine what someone else must be

437
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,880
thinking or feeling

438
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,470
so you see empathy is different from

439
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,690
sympathy in that you don't pity the

440
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,059
other person for their circumstances but

441
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:47,909
instead you take on their circumstances

442
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,039
put yourself in their place and truly

443
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,809
try to navigate their thoughts and

444
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:57,549
feelings empathy is hard work

445
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:01,779
it requires emotional endurance it

446
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:04,419
requires you to do the work of gaining

447
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:09,549
additional perspectives so I'll tell you

448
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:13,570
a story about empathy it's a hard one to

449
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,640
tell too recently I was in a situation

450
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,010
where a male teammate disagreed with a

451
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,260
decision that I had made and suggested

452
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,750
that my tone regarding the situation

453
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:33,390
needed to be addressed my tone

454
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,970
I was pissed

455
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,630
I was so instantly pissed off like a lot

456
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:46,480
a lot of being pissed off I felt that if

457
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,070
the same argument had been had between

458
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,930
two men that there would be absolutely

459
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,310
no way that tone would be brought into

460
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,570
that conversation at all

461
00:23:52,570 --> 00:24:00,190
I stood about this for two days I wanted

462
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,050
to summon the fury of a thousand Jen's

463
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,180
and just write this guy off as being

464
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,340
small-minded and sexist and I just

465
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,170
didn't want to deal with him but for all

466
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,650
of the angry things that I wanted I knew

467
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,740
something had to happen I had a hard

468
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,850
time seeing blight begrudgingly I knew

469
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,310
that somewhere in the back of me there

470
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,830
was this tiny quiet voice from Cascadia

471
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,220
j/s saying something about personal

472
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,120
growth and I'm not sure what that was it

473
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,360
was really hard to hear over the anger

474
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,620
fortunately I had the support of others

475
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,840
on my team to help me through the

476
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,970
decisions that lay before me because I

477
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,040
could take the path that led to more

478
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,250
conflict and engendered arguments and

479
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:58,060
indulge those triggers or I could engage

480
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,510
in problem-solving and see that action

481
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,720
for what it was and try to look at the

482
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,250
problem from a different perspective and

483
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,650
it was hard it didn't come to me

484
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,310
immediately or it never came to me on my

485
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,790
own I had to ask for help I brought

486
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,370
another person in a neutral third party

487
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,950
to mediate a face-to-face meeting with

488
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,770
my other teammate and it was super

489
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,530
uncomfortable I had a stomach ache that

490
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:35,880
whole morning but out of that meeting

491
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,780
came wonderful things we were both able

492
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,900
to hear each other and get the context

493
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,790
of where the other person was coming

494
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,540
from

495
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,850
and it's worth noting that our notorious

496
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,010
exchange took place over two over

497
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,980
instant-message so it's fair to say that

498
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,290
we were both reading way different

499
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,240
things than the other person had been

500
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,430
typing we both apologize and with the

501
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,310
tension nearly evaporating I was able to

502
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,980
commit to helping this man this other

503
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,600
person in the situation my teammate

504
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,310
improve so that we could achieve our

505
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,580
shared goal together and not find

506
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,360
ourselves in the situation again only

507
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,760
with empathy were we both able to look

508
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,430
at the situation and recognize that what

509
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,770
was needed wasn't damning that other

510
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:33,640
person but committing that we can both

511
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:40,600
do better I chose the path of emotional

512
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,470
safety not just for me but for both of

513
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,600
us I'm saying this because the person

514
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
involved is my collaborator on a project

515
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,330
that I am leading which is why I feel I

516
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,950
have a greater responsibility for his

517
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,930
emotional safety and why I'm holding

518
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:02,530
myself to this standard and at this

519
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,690
point in the story I want to tell you

520
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,760
that we lived happily ever after and the

521
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,400
project was great and we continued to

522
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,150
collaborate evenly and it was awesome

523
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:17,200
but the truth is that immediately as in

524
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,900
a week later I turned around and screwed

525
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,080
it all up another situation happened

526
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,270
between us that was a thing that we had

527
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,610
spoke about in that meeting happened and

528
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,370
it just it pissed me off again and this

529
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,950
time absolutely zero emotional Safety's

530
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:41,850
then came to me I got so angry I just

531
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,980
said screw it and I indulge my triggers

532
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,110
and I acted passively aggressive

533
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,480
Liat towards my teammate and just fail

534
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,030
wailed everywhere all over the place for

535
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,320
a week and all of this was directed at a

536
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,010
guy I had committed to teaming up with

537
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:05,010
say a week ago to do better fortunately

538
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,250
I have trusted teammates who reminded me

539
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,130
of my commitment who kept me accountable

540
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,290
to my standards and forced me to have a

541
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,330
face-to-face with this teammate and it

542
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:23,299
was horrible but you know what I did I

543
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:27,120
mean I cried I cried a lot I knew I

544
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,799
failed I failed him I failed you

545
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,910
I felt like emotional safety is too hard

546
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,160
and how can I even be all about this if

547
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,049
I can't keep myself together over one

548
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:42,299
conflict how am i any different from

549
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:51,299
anyone else but in that meeting I owned

550
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,360
my failures and I owned my fears and my

551
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,130
hopes I was able to admit to all of the

552
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,010
people in that meeting my failure and I

553
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,970
apologized because I think if there's

554
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,919
anything that makes it makes me

555
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,900
different it's that I do care and I do

556
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,390
want to get this right emotional safety

557
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,580
is really hard and I'm not here to tell

558
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,000
you that it's not you won't always get

559
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,160
it right and you definitely won't be

560
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,730
able to do that alone emotional safety

561
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,390
is a personal responsibility that can be

562
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,669
reinforced by good leaders so yes I

563
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:39,179
truly believe empathy is a quality every

564
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,250
person can be taught that will improve

565
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,340
the quality of their life significantly

566
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,770
it'll improve the quality of their

567
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,900
interactions the quality of their

568
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,020
conversations I know it will improve the

569
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,780
quality of their conflicts and their

570
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,940
relationships I'm just gonna say this I

571
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,770
haven't said it before but it's

572
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:07,640
important feelings are important to me

573
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,690
no one deserves to feel like crap

574
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,599
and we all have we all know how that

575
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,549
feels

576
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:19,809
our bodies our bodies unconsciously

577
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:23,919
crave safety everyone wants to feel good

578
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,649
and I believe that everyone wants to do

579
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:33,479
good statistics tell us a story but I

580
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:38,269
think we can start a better one
