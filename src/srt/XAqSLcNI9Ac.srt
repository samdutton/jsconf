1
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,750

let's get started so BPM and Jas the

2
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,600
thing is most of us already know have an

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,400
idea of what BPM is it's beats per

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,740
minute and you know we know it's a

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,320
generalized tempo measurement for songs

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,840
see how fast or slow it is but if you

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,370
really look around historically it's

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,559
been a very manual process you have

9
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:42,430
people labeling the actual beats and

10
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,809
uploading profiles to databases to make

11
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,790
this data available to applications and

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,580
you know that's just not ideal in a

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,720
world where things are changing so

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,430
quickly and we want this data available

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,430
readily so I wanted to look into number

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,769
one how to make this an automatic

17
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:00,409
detection process and second of all you

18
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:01,879
know just trying to bring it into the

19
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,409
JavaScript world so that we can all use

20
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:07,310
it first things just a little bit about

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,740
myself right now i'm working at twitter

22
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,090
in the new york office as a software

23
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,820
engineer on the web team my name is

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,260
janessa debt if you didn't catch that

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,860
from the first slide and the program and

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,299
previously from that I come from the

27
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,860
background of computer graphics and

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,049
vision and then before that a lot of bio

29
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,509
engineering where I mostly hated the bio

30
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:31,369
and mostly like to the engineering so so

31
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,049
what are we really talking about here in

32
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,180
terms of what's behind automatic

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,939
detection of BPM well in research they

34
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,130
call it on set detection so if you look

35
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,170
at the signal that I have here what we

36
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,969
have is we're looking for this thing

37
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:46,009
we're looking for when the beat happens

38
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,320
there's a really sharp signal change and

39
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,570
we want to see where that is to know

40
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,880
where beats are happening so what this

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,829
is fundamental to is like a million

42
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:58,100
different fields and that includes sonar

43
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,979
speech EKGs movement detection and you

44
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,499
know some things maybe like Iron Man I

45
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,659
think I secretly wanted to put him in

46
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,450
slide the student something but

47
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,150
seriously sort of so discover ran an

48
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,950
interesting article about becoming iron

49
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,569
man how close is research to really

50
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,370
making these suits that you can control

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,170
you know with your nerves if you're into

52
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,910
the comic books that he installs stuff

53
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,900
into his body to interface and you know

54
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,550
that involves things like EEG or

55
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,360
electroencephalogram EEG on sets for the

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,190
nerve signals and you do a lot of

57
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,040
analysis after

58
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,540
but you get the point this is a very

59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,370
fundamental sort of applicable thing not

60
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,930
just to music but a lot of things but

61
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,989
since I'm a music nerd personally I like

62
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,599
to think of it this is a much more

63
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,280
interesting application that I want to

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,019
look at which is a automatic

65
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,510
transcription of music the first step is

66
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,340
you know detecting your beats of course

67
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,409
but there's also things like instrument

68
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,269
identification instrument isolation

69
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:56,370
pitch dejection dynamics all things that

70
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,019
I plan to hopefully in the future look

71
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,109
into as well and by reading lots of

72
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:04,709
research papers and stuff so so why did

73
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,120
I want to bring into the browser like

74
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,010
you know there's see implementations in

75
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,480
research being passed around of this

76
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,540
stuff well the biggest thing is I find

77
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,609
research papers in this whole academic

78
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,579
research area to be so niche and closed

79
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,919
and you know entwined in the politics

80
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,720
and people never really look at research

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,790
papers I wanted to bring that sort of

82
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,590
engineering and make it accessible and

83
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,049
shareable and cross-platform and make it

84
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,090
easy for all of us here to just use and

85
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,459
play with and the other thing that

86
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,079
enables this is that you know the

87
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,479
browser's javascript is seriously fast

88
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,239
now like it's no joke like this article

89
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,359
that ran earlier and that's really just

90
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,560
it's just helping us to do things that

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,239
are really computationally heavy without

92
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,919
having to worry about delays and lag

93
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,440
time as much and with things like you

94
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,909
know we just saw so much going on with

95
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,819
WebGL and web audio and digital signals

96
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,290
processing is really enabled in the

97
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,879
browser now it's pushing that forward we

98
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,470
can do a lot of these computational

99
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,879
things which you know makes the

100
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,769
browser's really powerful you can do so

101
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,349
much awesome stuff so the caveat of

102
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:09,419
course is you know all these things are

103
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,680
great but they only work in the latest

104
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,049
and greatest canary beta you know new

105
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,430
shiny builds of I'm sorry about that I'm

106
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,419
in chrome firefox safari and opera and

107
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:22,530
that was a little bit mean because i ii

108
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,070
really is coming along with that but

109
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,289
also why in the browser well you know

110
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:29,580
when i was thinking about doing this

111
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,199
honestly this was the biggest reason I

112
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,669
think javascript is fun I think this

113
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:33,930
stuff is fun and it would be cool to

114
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,340
play with and I think that's the best

115
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,340
reason to start working on something and

116
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,469
another thing to know is that the

117
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:42,599
browser is really diverse now you know

118
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,909
it's not the 90s anymore for document

119
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,540
display

120
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,040
most interesting thing I could find was

121
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,100
you know unlimited gifs of Sailor Moon

122
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,670
or gifts or whatever and more

123
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,170
importantly the community is really

124
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,000
diverse like we've seen such a great

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,620
subset here of the JavaScript community

126
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,030
everyone comes from such different

127
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,160
backgrounds and art background music

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
backgrounds you know all sorts of

129
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,390
engineering and because of that we're

130
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,830
really pushing the use cases of the

131
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,270
browser and what we can do with it and

132
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,790
what it's becoming enabled for you know

133
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,340
we're influencing it by making people

134
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,020
who are on the standards community think

135
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,490
about the different things that we want

136
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,960
to do it that besides you know

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,910
displaying all the animated gifs you

138
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,230
could possibly find on the Internet my

139
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,570
personal mission in terms of this little

140
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,580
diversity thing is I come up from an

141
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,470
engineering background from my undergrad

142
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,410
I'm a huge music nerd and you know now

143
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,120
I'm doing full-fledged computer science

144
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,730
web development so I like to put this my

145
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,490
bio finding ways to breed engineering

146
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,560
research music and art with a trusty

147
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,000
steed of JavaScript that's JavaScript

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,970
not horse GS to make the magical

149
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,370
unicorns of my imagination reality so I

150
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,960
found an image that sort of like

151
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,120
captured my mental image I wanted to

152
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
share with you so just in case you

153
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,380
didn't know this this is magical unicorn

154
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,630
I'm going for breathing fire like epics

155
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,290
eyes and that's me that's the cat riding

156
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,570
the epic magical unicorn and there's a

157
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,100
little nyan cat in the back from the set

158
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,480
I thought that was like really awesome

159
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,550
but you know this is like living the

160
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,290
dream like I you know I'm going to take

161
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,180
engineering it's smash it with art and

162
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,950
music and JavaScript and it's going to

163
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,260
like look awesome but so far because

164
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,210
things are coming along a lot of my

165
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,980
projects end up looking like that you

166
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,320
know what is he saying there I must eat

167
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,660
more rainbows like it's it's there a

168
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,100
little bit lumpy and awkward right now

169
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,240
but we're getting there you know and

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,040
it's still a lot of fun you still have a

171
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,690
unicorn it's just you know in kind of

172
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,810
you know awkward and derping but anyways

173
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,280
let's jump in let's breathe some

174
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,590
unicron's so this is a big question

175
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,600
right how do we do onset detection like

176
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,510
what is this first I want to take a

177
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,030
quick step back and think about you know

178
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,620
BPM we think about it because DJ's are

179
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,500
like all popular now and you know BPM

180
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,330
it's like that you know some pump that

181
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,190
you hear on the bottom but

182
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,600
it can mean a lot of things it's really

183
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,270
tied to human psychology and it's can be

184
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,830
anything from percussive beats which is

185
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,780
what we think of it could also be

186
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,520
pitching notes you know you have like a

187
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,920
flute piece from the classical music era

188
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,140
and it's like you don't have a drum in

189
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,760
the back like you know and seeing you

190
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,420
know like in a club so on sets this is

191
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,230
just a little bit of research

192
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,240
terminology they like to categorize it

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,970
into a lot of different names because it

194
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,710
is more complex than just detecting

195
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,600
where the drums are so there's you know

196
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,180
pitched or not pitch percussive and more

197
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,700
commonly now it's complex mix which is

198
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,140
basically like everything else because

199
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,650
we can't label everything some quick

200
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,920
sort of just scoping a lot of times V

201
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,690
pm's are associated with genres these

202
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,670
days for an example you know drum and

203
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,670
bass they like to say it's like 160 to

204
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,340
180 and etc etc and you know if we're

205
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,530
talking about classical music if you

206
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,600
have a background did it I did piano for

207
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,570
14 years so this adagio for an example

208
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,280
66 276 BPM it's not just this new DJ

209
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,990
thing like matching bpms in the quote

210
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,880
you know so detection method so how do

211
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,680
we do this and how did I learn how to do

212
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,530
this well I read a lot of research

213
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,320
papers and I'm not going to read this up

214
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,890
to you right now but I think this part

215
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,850
was actually a lot of fun and

216
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,400
interesting understanding some esoteric

217
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,320
language so I'll break it down into

218
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,419
something sort of bite-sized for this

219
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,470
talk so first what we're doing there's

220
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,540
some general steps we're doing an SD ft

221
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,820
short-time fourier transform which

222
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,349
basically the purpose of it is to prep

223
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:37,380
the signal for detection functions then

224
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,940
we do the detection function what these

225
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,210
are our functions that are meant to

226
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,469
selectively maximize for on sort

227
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:44,760
properties that we're looking for and

228
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,710
turn them into strong signals we can

229
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,010
peak pick out in peak picking which

230
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,790
after you have those highlighted on set

231
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,890
times you can pick out those times from

232
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,360
the signal that you've now got all I

233
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,870
processed and from there it's the you

234
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,330
know home free you calculate the BPM so

235
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,589
I'm not going to go too much into the

236
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,209
mathematical detail of things but

237
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,399
I do want to show you a high level view

238
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,649
of what this looks like just so you have

239
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:15,449
an idea of what I've tried to stuff into

240
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:20,220
javascript st ft does a number of steps

241
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,929
it's not just a fourier transform it

242
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,970
does window slicing slicing the signal

243
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,369
into overlapping windows often for this

244
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:28,529
application as small as 50 milliseconds

245
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,439
80 milliseconds and then you apply

246
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:34,850
Hamming window to trim off the edges of

247
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,490
bad stuff basically discontinuities and

248
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,809
normalization normalizing the magnitude

249
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,149
and zero padding because it needs to be

250
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,129
a power of two to do an F of T on it and

251
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,929
it clarifies the signal and get into

252
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:48,119
that if you want on your own and then

253
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:50,970
finally you do your FFT and get a bunch

254
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,740
of complex numbers in a matrix so

255
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,209
detection functions what these look like

256
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:00,149
I'm going to go over the ones that were

257
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,610
frequency based because they were more

258
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,470
robust out of some of the ones I looked

259
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,869
at and also these seem to be the ones

260
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:08,579
that are more prevalent more robust

261
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:11,519
Scott recognition high frequency content

262
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,399
and spectral difference I stuck the math

263
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,929
in there if their math and engineering

264
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,670
nerds and want to like dig into the

265
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,689
exclamations but these to maximize on

266
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,660
energy which you know tends to be those

267
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,959
percussive beats phase deviation is more

268
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,589
sensitive to things like pitch and

269
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,999
euclidean distance tries to smash these

270
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,740
two things together into something a

271
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,199
little bit more balanced so you know

272
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:38,790
we're looking for that onset they're

273
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,639
trying to highlight it peak picking

274
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,660
there's a few it's not as simple as you

275
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,279
would think be just because these

276
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,660
signals are noisy and you're doing

277
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,740
processing on them they're still going

278
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,480
to be noisy so you're building an

279
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,389
adaptive threshold which you'll kind of

280
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,129
see the visualizations later that I have

281
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:58,829
for this and by applying that threshold

282
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:00,839
we try to cut out the noise and actually

283
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,220
pick out where the on sets are so

284
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,499
initial peak finding you threshold them

285
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:06,990
out and refractory period is another way

286
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,259
of filtering where you say oh there's no

287
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:11,639
way that there can be a beat between

288
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,079
this time at this time cuz it's too

289
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,790
short and it's probably noise because

290
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,769
they're right next to each other so this

291
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:18,720
helps to cut out some of those noisy

292
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,129
signals if you pick some of your windows

293
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:20,750
wrong

294
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,400
um and not to bore you too much with the

295
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,650
nitty gritty details of this but peak

296
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,740
times this is a trivial example but say

297
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,650
I have a bunch of peak times so it's

298
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,320
really simple from here it's about 0.5

299
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,720
across the way I average it and there's

300
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,670
a beat every half second and that's

301
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,890
about 120 BPM you missed the happy

302
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,140
unicorn I press next well I think the

303
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,680
unicorn I had high hopes for my unicorn

304
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,750
how do you do it in JavaScript I'm going

305
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,040
to go over some of the fun things I ran

306
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,860
into their kind of fun oh but before

307
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,410
that I tried to think of some

308
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,420
interesting things I could do with this

309
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,970
you know initial implementation and i

310
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,320
found one song that i particularly like

311
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,520
if you don't listen to discovery they're

312
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,320
fantastic you should look them up but so

313
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,090
insane by discovery they do an

314
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,190
interesting thing where and two in two

315
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,020
spots in the song they kind of dip it

316
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,910
down into a lower BPM and like slow it

317
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,830
down make it like all you know groovy

318
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,740
and I wanted to see if I can maybe pick

319
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,630
that up by slicing it into 10 second

320
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,450
signals or 10 second windows of signals

321
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,130
and pushing it through and seeing if I

322
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,020
could see a modulation I signed some

323
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,240
colors to it where darker means a slower

324
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,110
BPM and lighter means a lighter a higher

325
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,540
BPM and I found that these two patches

326
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,790
you know there tends to second signal so

327
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,680
it's still pretty granular but it

328
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,480
actually picked up pretty closely to the

329
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,250
timestamps on the bottom where these

330
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,420
were happening so I was really excited

331
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,589
about that one to show you so tools that

332
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,600
I use that were really helpful just

333
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,940
being like how do i bring this research

334
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,540
paper and put it into javascript and DSP

335
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,060
jas was really helpful I didn't have to

336
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,490
run my own fft algorithm it's been done

337
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,380
it's been out there and people have been

338
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,570
using it I used it also for my windowing

339
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,240
function so that was super helpful

340
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,100
there's a note actually you know there

341
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,900
wasn't an NPM version I've had to do

342
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,640
some interesting wrapping of the stuff

343
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,839
only that I needed and taking it out but

344
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,140
Web Audio does great things like how i

345
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,000
used it in its most rudimentary form is

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,640
you take a signal you throw the file at

347
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,779
Web Audio and it will spit out a sample

348
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,519
and a float 32 array for me to work with

349
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,879
which is great complex arithmetic you do

350
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,860
have to do complex math with this so i

351
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,259
found a handy npm module so that I

352
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,459
didn't have to write that too because

353
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,499
that would just be silly to reinvent the

354
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:49,230
wheel and a lot of the other stuff I

355
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,240
just had to kind of write a lot of math

356
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,120
and stick it in a lot of loops so for

357
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,610
that browserify was a huge help for me

358
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,170
just being able to keep my code

359
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,730
organized and sane so I could see what

360
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,230
was going on see how things were

361
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,339
connecting clear a thing about how it

362
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,290
actually connected together BPM that was

363
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,569
my like main driver module web audio as

364
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:11,490
I said feeds a signal and information in

365
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,100
and these were the three things i went

366
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,589
over before so I separated them out

367
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,220
according to what I saw and a lot of the

368
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,100
math was happening there so connecting

369
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,720
up all of those things there and

370
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,519
detection I had the for detection

371
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,220
function so this is much easier to you

372
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,499
know browser fighters I just really like

373
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:36,089
it and source maps are awesome so so

374
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,980
interesting challenges that Iran to this

375
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,279
is a little anecdotal I suppose I've

376
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,050
never really had to work with float32

377
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,300
arrays before this so that was

378
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,579
interesting because I realized you know

379
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,230
you can't just add zeros on to the end

380
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,360
you have to like slice it and like copy

381
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,100
be a ray buffer and stick it in a thing

382
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,259
that's bigger and so that was

383
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,720
interesting to learn about and I mean

384
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,519
that's the best thing if you're learning

385
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,959
when you're building new projects so it

386
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,230
was fun but compatibility you know Web

387
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,819
Audio is enabled right now in chrome and

388
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:07,559
now also in beta versions of everything

389
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,529
else which is great but that's something

390
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:13,350
that you kind of have to be realistic

391
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,569
about and then complex arithmetic in

392
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:17,610
matrices like you know coming from

393
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,110
engineering where like MATLAB does

394
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,370
everything for you they have like a

395
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,230
function do the most complex things and

396
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,089
matrices and just spits out answers like

397
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,220
Java scripts not built for that so I had

398
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,110
a lot of like verbose like pushing stuff

399
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,639
around like beating it into like

400
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,829
JavaScript form to make it really like

401
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,309
pop out the complex stuff that I needed

402
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,720
and the biggest thing was just figuring

403
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,579
out how not to break chrome I have an

404
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,249
optimization slide later where I know I

405
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:42,929
haven't addressed a lot of optimizations

406
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:44,399
things that I wanted to do but didn't

407
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,889
quite get to so I'm aware but

408
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:49,589
was really interesting so there was a

409
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:52,379
lot of this where I actually put t bug

410
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:54,209
statement in a place that I probably

411
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,619
shouldn't have put a debug statement but

412
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,149
it was late at night these are those

413
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:59,369
complex objects from that library and it

414
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:01,230
was like for windows in it was like put

415
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,389
and you know I tweeted it out of

416
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:04,709
frustration of course my snarky

417
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,119
coworkers are like well we could just

418
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,290
doing something complex well there's

419
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,209
your problem like saying sits like four

420
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,980
in the morning not encouraging but like

421
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,809
literally it would get to the point

422
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,879
where you know chrome started showing me

423
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,439
like measurement rulers randomly and

424
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,269
they would get like stuck it be like by

425
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,709
the way your window is blah blah and

426
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:21,029
like I've never seen this before I have

427
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,679
what did I do to it like you know my

428
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,540
poor chrome is like crying at me and

429
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,149
like after a while like yeah I would hit

430
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:29,009
localhost 3000 and literally it would

431
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,720
just meet a crash be like no I know what

432
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,009
you do at this dress like you can't do

433
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,040
this anymore to either stop but that was

434
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,779
interesting and you know looking at

435
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,519
these arrays there's a lot of dots

436
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,049
behind this tweet where it's like

437
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:42,839
thousands of you know indices that I was

438
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,549
kind of scraping through it and you know

439
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:46,769
you make mistakes doing like math.pow

440
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,079
late at night doing math pow number two

441
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,429
instead of two number and etc so I was

442
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,350
getting a lot of these like no no no no

443
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,299
no no no and when you're you know seeing

444
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:01,559
a lot of these late at night my head I

445
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,169
was like nananananana batman i was like

446
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,299
god i'm going crazy like someone save me

447
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,839
from the nand's so these were some

448
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,360
interesting nights me and you know

449
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,429
chrome happy together in Batman um

450
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:20,269
anyways enough of that you get the point

451
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:22,559
all right so here's where I'm going to

452
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,079
kind of I stuck a lot of little plotter

453
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,819
things in there to help debug and I

454
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,679
think it really illustrates what's going

455
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,809
on in the signal and to see you know all

456
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,370
the math stuff that I did before in

457
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,480
action so I thought that would be

458
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,639
helpful to kind of show my code working

459
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,139
and crunching these numbers and shaping

460
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,649
them so this is what the original signal

461
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:42,570
something like this would look like it's

462
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,690
just plotting the signal Hamming window

463
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,049
trimming off the edges as I said then

464
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:51,210
the normalization the numbers are like

465
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,130
tiny but there's like one at the top of

466
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,960
that and zero padding as much as you

467
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,070
want and then FF

468
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,509
tease it you know you saw in the

469
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:01,950
previous screen shots just complex

470
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,299
Cumberland complex their complex numbers

471
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:07,460
this might be a little bit small but

472
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,190
they're actually not that many lines of

473
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,299
code it was just a little bit of

474
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,250
wrangling working with float32 arrays as

475
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,690
I said you know padding the signal it's

476
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,340
not just like push punches ears at the

477
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,840
end it's like no there's like an array

478
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,929
buffer and then a view on top so things

479
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:23,759
like that FFT this would have been so

480
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,460
much longer if I didn't have DSP so you

481
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,870
know god bless Diaz pjs same here for

482
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,059
the detection functions I'm just going

483
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,340
to bring them all out here so these are

484
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,809
the four that I covered before kept the

485
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,940
math there they're actually not that bad

486
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,009
you know once you learn how to read

487
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:43,080
mathematical and you know discrete

488
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,539
notation like you could do so much with

489
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,000
it so maybe I'm echoing other people but

490
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,320
like don't be afraid of this stuff it's

491
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,710
it's just a couple lines coat you know

492
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,039
not bad unicorns still looking pretty

493
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,720
good I thought peak picking so this is

494
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,460
what it looks like after I've applauded

495
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,659
detection function I've done that

496
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,360
Euclidean distance one here so you see

497
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,860
that you have some like strong peaks

498
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,679
going up here and that's detecting where

499
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,970
those on sets are happening and it's

500
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,440
really like spiking the signal up there

501
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,100
so that you can pick this out afterwards

502
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,929
here is the median filter step which is

503
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:21,990
part of the threshold assuming over the

504
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,179
signal according to a window size that

505
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,710
you can kind of filter out a lot of that

506
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,110
noise that's going on that's just

507
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,000
interrupting like seeing clear Peaks

508
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,460
like that so after its filtered it's a

509
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,350
lot clearer it's flat it's flat like

510
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,450
that and you basically choose out the

511
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,590
peaks and etc etc and you have an array

512
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,080
of times and like I showed before you

513
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,850
take those and what I do is I take the

514
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,669
gaps average them and do a little bit of

515
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:52,460
math and you have a BPM for your sample

516
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,230
so here's my optimization and

517
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,460
performance slide how not to break

518
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,139
Chrome I know there are ways and I just

519
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:00,750
have it quite delved into it yet but I'm

520
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,509
excited too soon because I want to fix a

521
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:06,779
couple things but web workers I think

522
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,269
are just ripe for this sort of thing

523
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:10,590
especially for the short-time fourier

524
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,490
transforms

525
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,130
step where and have like a gazillion 50

526
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,720
millisecond windows and doing the exact

527
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,190
same thing to every single one of them

528
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,920
so you know pass them into a web worker

529
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,080
I'm as far as i know i know there's like

530
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,940
an exception for typed arrays as well

531
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,410
where you don't have to serialize and

532
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,640
deserialize it which just slows

533
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,470
everything down and i'm using typed

534
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,120
arrays so if i can just pass that

535
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,850
through process all the crap and pass it

536
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,440
back like that'll be a huge performance

537
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,840
gain for me most music songs don't

538
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,980
change in tempo or BPM so if I slice

539
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,480
well-selected windows I don't have to

540
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,520
process like a 10 minute song all at

541
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,470
once like you know take it one from the

542
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,630
beginning middle and end like I think I

543
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,520
could basically figure it out and that

544
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,950
would save just a ton of computation oh

545
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,870
I have a third point that didn't show up

546
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,590
but it's basically about you know as I'm

547
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,670
jas you know and L ljs it's perfect for

548
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,840
this and I've just started learning

549
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,179
about it so I might go back and like

550
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,650
rewrite the whole thing and LLL and see

551
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,230
what happens so we'll see but I thought

552
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,880
this was interesting so I tried out a

553
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,650
matlab implementation and MATLAB is like

554
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,270
you know the engineering dream it does

555
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,220
all the things with matrices all at once

556
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,990
for me you know median filter like I

557
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,340
wrote a median filter that one it's like

558
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,520
median one signal window size it's like

559
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960
one line I'm like wow wish I could do

560
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,220
that in JavaScript I guess love to make

561
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,770
it so people can do it dresser but it

562
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,470
was cool because you know I was testing

563
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,690
the signals on both of them and they

564
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,370
actually take about the same time it's

565
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,650
not like MATLAB is like exponentially

566
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,030
faster like I thought it would be I

567
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,150
think a 10 second signal I tried it was

568
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,010
like an uncompressed wave or something

569
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,080
it took a couple seconds in the browser

570
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,390
just not bad matlab was about the same

571
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,860
you know it's like busy busy busy and it

572
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,780
spit out some stuff so i was really

573
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,790
encouraged by that you know like go Jess

574
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:04,470
love it and you know the dream here is

575
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,420
if I can make it fast enough like all of

576
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,920
this processing stuff with like the

577
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,090
heavy computation has always been like

578
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,860
something I post back and it generates

579
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,270
and generates like it's been a couple

580
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,070
hours can I accept it yet like there's a

581
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,350
queue can't fetch it yet but if we could

582
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,210
do this like all the client side and

583
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,550
just like process almost real time I

584
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,169
think that would be super powerful just

585
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:23,020
for

586
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,250
you know anything you think of to do

587
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,580
this with oh there it is as inscripted

588
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,560
ljs if you're a here for Brendan's chalk

589
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,370
which was epic you know about all that

590
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,600
alright so there are some weaknesses

591
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,190
that I need to be realistic about and

592
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,630
these come straight from the research on

593
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,450
onset detection you might have heard me

594
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,950
mentioning things like the median filter

595
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,020
window time you know the window slicing

596
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,310
could be 50 milliseconds or 80

597
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,530
milliseconds and the thing is if you use

598
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,330
those wrong like you just make really

599
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,220
giant windows or you filter out that

600
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,600
thing so it's so smooth like you

601
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,550
eliminate all the on sets like you are

602
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,200
going to break this like it will give

603
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,450
you crazy numbers that make you know

604
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,840
zero sense so that's just something to

605
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,730
be aware of and something that you know

606
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,810
I still need to test different

607
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,370
parameters for different detection

608
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,610
functions to see kind of where I can

609
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,320
apply them and where I can't and so also

610
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,150
previous feeds into that prior knowledge

611
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,830
is often helpful to selecting the right

612
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,960
detection functions like I said some of

613
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,820
them are pitch based so if you have like

614
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,950
a flute piece like the pricasso one is

615
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,330
probably not going to do that well on

616
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,520
that but you know phase deviation might

617
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,850
and there's still a lot going on

618
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,590
research so there's lots of reading to

619
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:40,320
do and just more things to look into so

620
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,580
future work just on the more general

621
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,460
side besides wanting to make it faster

622
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,950
is this is really only scratching the

623
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,930
surface of research like I read a couple

624
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,790
of papers found some good summary papers

625
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,860
that summarize a lot of things going on

626
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,380
in the fields but there's so many more

627
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,700
detection functions that people are

628
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,530
developing every day like this is their

629
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,600
full time job they're phd's like

630
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,730
underfed underpaid and this is what they

631
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,250
do all day in the lab and you know I

632
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,870
almost went into research and I'm glad I

633
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,040
did because I don't have the personality

634
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,170
for that but god bless lot of people who

635
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,710
do like this is crazy awesome stuff and

636
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,270
as I mentioned previously for different

637
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,190
applications you know onset detection

638
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,710
exists it's just for signals so really

639
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,270
the only differences is yanking out the

640
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,860
detection functions I'm using for music

641
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,960
and sticking other ones in and maybe

642
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,850
other things I just haven't read up on

643
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,340
you know on such detection for nerve

644
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,150
signals and stuff like that

645
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,390
so grating time so how did I do was my

646
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,700
JavaScript music engineering you know

647
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,650
stuck together and taped with scotch

648
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,920
tape unicorn beautiful well it's a

649
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,660
little bit forced like I have to admit

650
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,280
like it's I felt like I was like

651
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,160
sticking you know like cuz engineering

652
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,620
is a cute pug and into like a JavaScript

653
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,540
horse suit and it grew a horn and some

654
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,910
like fudz like it was it was okay like

655
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,380
there's a lot of things I can do better

656
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,730
hopefully that I clean it up you know

657
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,320
put more skin on it and it's like it'll

658
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,660
be good like we're really getting an air

659
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,290
with the browser the web is changing

660
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,450
aggressively and you know just as a

661
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,460
quick example i was just searching

662
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,830
around mpm for stuff to use and just to

663
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,480
see what i could find when you know very

664
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,820
like basic engineering certain keywords

665
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,100
DSP digital signal processing FFT which

666
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,890
is the fast Fourier transform filters a

667
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,310
little less there but there's a lot of

668
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,200
stuff out there for free that people are

669
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,330
using every day downloading maintaining

670
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,040
you know like this is really awesome

671
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,140
stuff like it's available for us to play

672
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,640
with and use and improve upon and

673
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,600
contribute to in god bless em p.m.

674
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,100
because I just did a search and I found

675
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,300
everything I needed so and things like

676
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,730
you know web audio and you know the w3c

677
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,440
really pushing forward on a lot of these

678
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,810
really powerful tools and you know des

679
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,370
pjs who's like written forever ago but

680
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,110
glad I didn't have to go to someone else

681
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,710
did so and it's a lot about you know

682
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,750
rethinking web engineering it's like I

683
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,090
thought that when I left biomedical

684
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,770
engineering so I hated bio it's like oh

685
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,110
god I like learned all of this

686
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,130
electrical engineering stuff for nothing

687
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,840
like what am I gonna do but you know

688
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,850
today you know yesterday I built a robot

689
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,530
with like a breadboard like the old days

690
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,290
and like you know now I get to use this

691
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,510
stuff in the web like you know I didn't

692
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,970
have to leave all that behind so what

693
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,440
does it mean to be a web engineer these

694
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,780
days how about more engineering like you

695
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,790
can bring all these things that you've

696
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,650
learned or if you want to learn like

697
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,080
there's stuff out there to learn and you

698
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,430
know we're all smart people that's why

699
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,410
we're here so how about more engineering

700
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,910
this kind of stuff with vendor prefixes

701
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,040
is not the final frontier anymore i know

702
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,840
a lot of people you know friends in New

703
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,220
York who have come over from finance

704
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,190
like completely different

705
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,080
Fields having no idea and they're like

706
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,149
oh my god okay look I found like CSS

707
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:51,500
transitions and I'm like that's really

708
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,360
nice now let me show you something on

709
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,220
NPM that it's really fun to play with

710
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,480
that you should play with like that

711
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,429
whole connect talk earlier like they

712
00:26:58,429 --> 00:26:59,570
would have so much fun with that like

713
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,129
you know these are cool and they're

714
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:02,899
important but like it's not the final

715
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:04,850
frontier like there is things beyond the

716
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,250
vendor prefix cacti and it's thorny in

717
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,049
the vendor prefix cacti but that's

718
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:13,909
another topic I think it's just really

719
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:16,820
important and I mean now at tort you

720
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,379
know towards the end of this conference

721
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:19,700
I feel like this is not even necessary

722
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,830
to say anymore but you know there have

723
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,379
been so many diverse talks just you know

724
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:26,450
today and all the other days and it's

725
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,220
really important for us I think to

726
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,190
embrace diversity like I think that this

727
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,470
field is young enough like you know web

728
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,659
engineering and JavaScript that a lot of

729
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:37,610
the people that I've met here are really

730
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,259
diverse they come from engineering

731
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:41,929
backgrounds art history background music

732
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:44,240
you know like fine arts anything you can

733
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,789
think of they've done it and I think

734
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:48,799
because we're such an open community

735
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,659
like that's what we're known for we

736
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:52,220
really need to embrace that and bring it

737
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,690
together and collaborate on all of our

738
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,919
different talents you know knowledge

739
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:56,629
really builds upon itself and combining

740
00:27:56,629 --> 00:27:58,370
these fields generates a lot of powerful

741
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,080
tools like you know you don't have to

742
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,669
figure out everything yourself like your

743
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:03,830
peers have done this like you know like

744
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,129
Raquel she worked on robots for years

745
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:08,990
and years like she can answer all of

746
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,649
your questions just ask you know and you

747
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,879
know just thinking outside of the box

748
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:16,129
like i said before like you know i do

749
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:17,659
web engineering at work all the time

750
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:20,360
every day but in my free time you know i

751
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,860
want to do something different but it's

752
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,360
still things that i know the web and

753
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,279
other things but it's really exciting

754
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,200
and a lot more fun i think for my free

755
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,820
time to just think outside the box so

756
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:35,090
you know breed on unicorn and that's all

757
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,710
I've got and I just wanted to say again

758
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,409
like I really look forward to seeing all

759
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:41,120
the diversity you can bring to web

760
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,070
engineering and you know show me what

761
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,039
you want to do and what you can do and I

762
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:49,789
think we'll all be better for it so yeah

763
00:28:49,789 --> 00:29:05,710
that's it thank
