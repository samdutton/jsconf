1
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,720

so I'm Nicholas and I work at Twitter I

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,210
recently joined the web core team there

3
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,010
I worked there with Brett who helped

4
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,880
organize this with Jonathan a Nicole and

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,280
I kind of ended up with the opportunity

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,809
to work it with it because I spent a lot

7
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,239
of time working on open source software

8
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,260
when I was working on open source stuff

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,170
we've got to meet a lot of really

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,489
interesting people who taught me a lot

11
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,650
about how to do web development

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,790
introduced me to other interesting

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,580
people and introduced me to all kinds of

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,570
different projects that were going on

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,970
one thing that really struck me was the

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,470
speed at which things were changing all

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,660
the time and pretty quickly I realized

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,270
that the thing that was holding me back

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,100
was not how quickly I could change the

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,630
code that I was working on but how

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,790
quickly I could adapt my way of thinking

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,380
to sort of accommodate all the other

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,560
stuff that was going on so when I first

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,300
started to learn how to do web

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,580
development which was like about five

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,119
years ago CSS was kind of the easy part

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,220
to work with initially once you learn

28
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,220
syntax and you learn how to make a you

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,860
know a button look red or whatever and

30
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,509
you think that you kind of know most of

31
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,069
what there is it's like this is pretty

32
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:30,929
easy to work with but four years later

33
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:33,030
by the time I joined Twitter what was

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,800
about to join Twitter I'd already lied

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,229
that working on CSS for large teams and

36
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,729
large web applications was a pretty

37
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,190
painful process and since I've joined

38
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,110
Twitter I've had the chance to write

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,520
more JavaScript and learn more about the

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,069
JavaScript world and work on to live CSS

41
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:48,959
code bases one for a tweet deck which I

42
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,149
helped rewrite and the other one which

43
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,209
is twitter com I realized that working

44
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,330
with CSS in some ways is probably like

45
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,380
one of the worst parts of being web

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,959
developer is really difficult to work

47
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,009
with because you have to kind of

48
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,530
maintain an awareness of how the whole

49
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,910
thing is put together in your mind or as

50
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,229
at least with JavaScript there are ways

51
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,750
to kind of work in small encapsulated

52
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,160
spaces and so that's going to be going

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,380
to kind of be like the backing like the

54
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,150
background to what I'm going to talk

55
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,040
about which is kind of some reflections

56
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,800
on like what I experienced when I was

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,300
learning about development and how a lot

58
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,440
of the things that people were teaching

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,849
me and best practices that I should

60
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,040
follow often came with this other

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,340
ideology that I kind of

62
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,500
realize at the time which was the this

63
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,239
searching for absolute truths and

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,800
looking for the one true way to do

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,569
things and the purging of other people's

66
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,819
ideas that didn't really match with what

67
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,700
was considered my best practice so as

68
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,319
we're heading into this time where the

69
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,239
web platform is changing very rapidly

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,700
and it's going to change a lot for CSS

71
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,530
developers as well it's kind of

72
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,510
interesting to look back and this is

73
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,310
something that I have learned to be so

74
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,440
look back at how things changed in the

75
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,940
past and how we responded to that change

76
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,099
to see if we can try to avoid some of

77
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,799
the mistakes that we made before so

78
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,349
before I was a developer I studied

79
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,239
natural sciences at University and

80
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,310
switched to anthropology after a friend

81
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,530
of mine introduced me to it there and it

82
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,959
was one of those things that everyone

83
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,190
has some moments in life where they say

84
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,629
this changed my life and studying

85
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,340
anthropology was one of those for me and

86
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,799
has been so far what I really liked

87
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,610
about it is it has this heavy focus on

88
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,620
looking for assumptions and to do that

89
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,610
you can have have to look through the

90
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,980
history of ideas and one of those is one

91
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,450
of those things where you're not even

92
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,410
necessarily aware of what your

93
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,670
assumptions are until you start

94
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,319
exploring some of the assumptions that

95
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,480
you are aware of and you see this whole

96
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,000
world of ways of thinking that were

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,010
created a long long time ago and that

98
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,769
we've kind of just adopted as just given

99
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:47,650
just a given as part of our lives and

100
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,299
when you do go look at the history of

101
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:51,010
these ideas as they kind of for CT when

102
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,560
you're not the apology student you get

103
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,609
to see what else was around at the time

104
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,349
some of the kind of debates that were

105
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,000
going on so maybe there's an idea that

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,109
came about there now we just take for

107
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:00,940
granted but at the time it was

108
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,889
controversial and it's kind of fun to

109
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,690
see the you know there were times or

110
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,769
even the smartest of people weren't

111
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,239
entirely convinced by things that now

112
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,090
everyone just assumes is the truth and

113
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,950
when you're doing that you see this sort

114
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,359
of pattern where ideas go through these

115
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,250
cycles where they get iterated upon and

116
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,450
something that didn't really work in its

117
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,660
time later perhaps it sort of makes more

118
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,919
sense in the context that it kind of

119
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,530
reappears this kind of like cycle of

120
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,979
Renaissance and decline and one of these

121
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:28,300
examples which is the one that I'm going

122
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,990
to use as the kind of example like the

123
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,240
showcase I suppose for for this as I

124
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,770
kind of talk through like HTML and CSS

125
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,890
is a one they sent us back into

126
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,320
pre-socratic Greece to try understand

127
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,129
where a lot of the

128
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:45,099
ideas when the west came from and so

129
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:46,689
this guy Heraclitus who i came across

130
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,699
who i don't really remember a huge

131
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,050
amount of the stuff there i studied

132
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,369
about inch increase by remember this guy

133
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:52,959
because one of the things that he said

134
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,349
really stuck with me and he was depicted

135
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:58,449
like this by Renaissance painters and it

136
00:04:58,449 --> 00:04:59,349
was really the Renaissance that

137
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:02,019
rediscovered a lot of the ideas that he

138
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,339
and a few of the other people they'll

139
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:06,459
talk about came up with and he had

140
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:07,929
contempt for humankind's he was

141
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:10,689
portrayed as the weeping the lonely

142
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,849
philosopher and he read a lot of really

143
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,649
obscure philosophy most of which was

144
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,149
lost the time but what's left is kind of

145
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,619
reads almost more like poetry than

146
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:19,479
philosophy you kind of have to sit back

147
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:20,919
and think what was he was he trying to

148
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,269
say here but his his main thing was this

149
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:26,289
like championing of the idea of an

150
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,749
ever-changing world one of his peers

151
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:30,399
someone called Parmenides had the

152
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,959
opposite view which was that the world

153
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,879
was static and the change was this

154
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,699
surface layer this illusion and that was

155
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,979
the context within which Democritus

156
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:41,019
found himself he was a contemporary of

157
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:43,360
Socrates and he was attempting to

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,219
reconcile this idea of an ever-changing

159
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,899
world in a static world like how can

160
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,399
these two ideas like live together or

161
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,050
how can I decide you know which one to

162
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,740
kind of support this is how he was

163
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,300
portrayed and he's always portrayed like

164
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,069
he kind of looks a bit evil like I keep

165
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:58,329
I kept trying to find better pictures

166
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:00,969
women he's always got like a berry and

167
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:04,449
like a shoulder out so little after D

168
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,909
and like Heraclitus he also had contempt

169
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,419
on some level for mankind and he was

170
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:11,289
known as the laughing I'm walking

171
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,169
philosopher like good likeness and from

172
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:15,279
today's perspective he had some really

173
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,829
modern ideas so he spoke about the

174
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:20,079
conservation of mass and energy the

175
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,849
indirect nature of perception but his

176
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,699
main the main thing he's remembered for

177
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,649
is the atomic conception of the universe

178
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:29,919
he came up with a very early idea of how

179
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,079
atoms works basically along with his

180
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,629
with his mental and he used atoms as a

181
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:35,979
way to try and reconcile these two ideas

182
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,169
the static and a changing world and he

183
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:39,789
said okay so the world is completely

184
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:41,979
changing like I combined to that but

185
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,809
when you reduce the world what is this

186
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:45,669
constituent parts his constituent parts

187
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:46,990
are all these different types of atoms

188
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,969
and these atoms are like billiard balls

189
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:51,159
they're like static unchanging and so

190
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,719
this is how we reconcile the exactly

191
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,580
it's both static and unchanging

192
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,379
unfortunately for him Plato and

193
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:58,759
Aristotle didn't like him they

194
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,739
criticized his work and him as a person

195
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:03,800
and this static idea this idea of a

196
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,119
static universe that parmenides

197
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,769
suggested was the one that became

198
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,419
dominant and stuck around for about

199
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,550
2,000 years until it was challenged

200
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,289
during the Renaissance and again later

201
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:15,589
with modern science this is the quote

202
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:17,569
that I remember from Heraclitus which is

203
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,159
that you cannot step into the same river

204
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:21,979
twice for fresh waters flowing in upon

205
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,679
you and so I'm reading this and I've

206
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,269
been sent back you know in time in

207
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:28,249
effect by my lecturers to read about

208
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,169
these guys and I've come across someone

209
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,610
from two and a half thousand years ago

210
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,679
and he's kind of giving me this license

211
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:35,599
to constantly revisit all the things

212
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,979
that I hold dear all the things that I

213
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:39,110
seemed to be true which is that was a

214
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,519
whole point of what the my lecturers

215
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,860
were trying to teach me and what he's

216
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,449
really saying is like if I come up to

217
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:45,739
this metaphorical river and I think it's

218
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:47,479
the same that's it's not that it's an

219
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,309
illusion necessarily but that's kind of

220
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:50,779
like an artifact of my way of thinking

221
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:51,979
I'm not really looking at the world

222
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:52,999
they've just sort of turned up and be

223
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:53,839
like oh yeah I've been a dash river

224
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,399
before it's the same but the rivers

225
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,779
different I'm different and the rest of

226
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,369
the world is different so it can't

227
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,679
really be the same when you think about

228
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,209
like what we do or like what I do now

229
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:05,419
when I write code instead of read this

230
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,059
stuff we're part of like this tech

231
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,319
industry and things are changing all the

232
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,179
time very rapidly and so it's very

233
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:13,519
interesting to me to see how we kind of

234
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,819
have these assumptions in this field and

235
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:17,779
kind of understanding that if our

236
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:18,800
context they're changing what are the

237
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,240
things that we hold dear and that we

238
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,849
seem to be true that may be on so I'm

239
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,379
going to skim over some of the history

240
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,419
of HTML and CSS and provide my

241
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:31,339
interpretation of that stuff so HTML

242
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,649
used to look a bit like this and you had

243
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,779
like tables and all the styling was

244
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,519
handled with these attributes that you'd

245
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,069
used to control positioning and other

246
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:43,069
things like font and you had like on

247
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:45,290
what you're lucky if you had in line

248
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,990
click hands like this and the cost of

249
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,910
this was that as HTML became more

250
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,800
complicated and added all these style

251
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,089
capabilities to meet the needs of what

252
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,519
people wanted to do with the web became

253
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,750
harder and harder to maintain you'd end

254
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,750
up with like huge piles of Dom with if

255
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,860
you wanted to change the look of every

256
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,569
single table so you'd have to like

257
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:03,980
finally replace in all that

258
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,420
give your templates if you wanted to add

259
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,620
some styles you'd have to go and do that

260
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,500
through every single part of your HTML

261
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,570
on top of that browsers had a lot of

262
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,030
difficulty consistently rendering this

263
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,290
so you'd get different browsers looking

264
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,360
different ways but all you had was a

265
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,680
single interface from which you could

266
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,390
try and control that and users

267
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,920
especially people of a suit with

268
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,570
assistive technologies couldn't kind of

269
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,060
customize the website to look and work

270
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,760
in a way that they needed it to you

271
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,100
around this time in 1994 the w3c was

272
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,930
formed and people started working on

273
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,370
style specifications which eventually

274
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,840
like all coalesced into a single

275
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,000
specification called CSS that became

276
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,870
specification recommendation in 1996 and

277
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,830
if you look through that document

278
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,570
there's a few interesting snippets in

279
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,800
that kind of give you an insight into

280
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,540
the way that people were thinking at the

281
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,580
time and some of their concerns as well

282
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,710
and there's this line here like to

283
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,970
increase the granularity of control over

284
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,950
elements a new attribute has been added

285
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,950
to HTML class so the class attribute was

286
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,900
added for the purposes of CSS so you can

287
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,060
apply your Styles through this interface

288
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,470
rather than like bundling the more than

289
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,250
to the on the actual done itself and

290
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,180
throughout the early parts of the

291
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,820
document of the specification you can

292
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,430
you can see that there's a concern with

293
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,290
what this could where this could bring

294
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,880
about and they tell you not to rely on

295
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,920
this power that they're afraid that this

296
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,840
would affect the universal semantics of

297
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,300
HTML because in effect i could just mark

298
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,700
everything up with leslie a div and then

299
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,010
control the entire presentation with CSS

300
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,420
whereas at least in the past they relied

301
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,280
on some of the HTML to provide me with

302
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,280
that so that was this kind of recurring

303
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,490
theme that they had and the CSS Zen

304
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,620
garden which came about started in 2003

305
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,470
was kind of met to be a way of showing

306
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,640
people like the right way to do things

307
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,730
which was to have semantic HTML and all

308
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,120
this powerful CSS and it was a it was

309
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,760
kind of an example of how you could like

310
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,170
an extreme example I'd say I've have

311
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,540
like a single page of unchanging HTML

312
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,300
this very like that idea of you know the

313
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,770
HTML is forever you don't change that

314
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,140
and you just switch out style sheets and

315
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,480
have like radically different looks so

316
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,710
it's really there to promote the use of

317
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,660
semantic markup and to sort of drag

318
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,400
people away from this table world

319
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,800
but out of this approach and the

320
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,360
reaction against the pre CSS authoring

321
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,040
days came a bunch of these things that

322
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,860
we kind of power it back to each other

323
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,090
this is one of my favorite ones don't

324
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,400
use on semantics last names whatever

325
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,610
they think on semantic means and this is

326
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,320
kind of this is this great quote from a

327
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,540
guy that really helped me learn a lot

328
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,680
about web development i was getting

329
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,570
started called Craigh caimans like his

330
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,190
suit in him and he said your HTML like

331
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,810
diamond should be forever and I only

332
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,040
bought into this this kind of

333
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,750
perspective like HTML as this thing it's

334
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,220
a fixed that's unchanging you just want

335
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,050
to write at once and then all of the

336
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,820
control of the presentation you just do

337
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,910
somewhere else in your CSS and that's

338
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,170
really what I kind of thought and I

339
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,820
applied this thinking to my blog and I

340
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,800
wrote one of the early phases one of the

341
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,810
early passes at my blog with like no

342
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,610
classes at all it was just like pure

343
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,020
descendant selectors this huge pile of

344
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,300
CSS that controlled it all when I spent

345
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,860
every day just me working on that code

346
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,660
that was okay but when I took a break

347
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,430
did some like real work and then came

348
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,140
back and tried to change my blog it was

349
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,270
like really horrible to work with very

350
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,980
difficult and at that point I started to

351
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,630
realize that despite the fact that I've

352
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,750
been like very I probably say militant

353
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,550
about this kind of approach thinking you

354
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,560
know my blog is like an example of a

355
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,240
perfection where you should be writing

356
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,310
HTML I decided this actually wasn't the

357
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,570
way I wanted to work and that it was

358
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,670
very hard for me to you know made my

359
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,400
life difficult basically and so your

360
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,780
diamond Dinah's might be forever but

361
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,690
your HTML probably isn't but this kind

362
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,820
of thinking is like so ingrained and so

363
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,810
much as part of like the general

364
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,460
discourse that it's even made its way

365
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,320
into the html5 spec where they're kind

366
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,450
of like encouraging us to use to write

367
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,040
class names that reflect the content of

368
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,980
the HTML rather than any presentational

369
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,560
aspects and alternative approaches have

370
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,510
been like repeatedly purged as a mark of

371
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,800
amateurs which kind of makes it very

372
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,410
hard for you to suggest not doing it

373
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,510
this way like even now when I taught

374
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,220
sort of at Twitter and I say well maybe

375
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,290
we should just use like an extra like

376
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,090
div like an empty Dave in the corner

377
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,160
here instead of all this crazy CSS it

378
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,750
kind of feel like I slit slightly have

379
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,010
to apologize for making that suggestion

380
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,010
because I know that other people looking

381
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,090
at me thinking what I used to think

382
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,840
about people who said things like this

383
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,190
but if you go back into the CSS spec

384
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,010
there's this other like chunkier his

385
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,330
sentence which is like a structure based

386
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,070
on class is only useful with in a

387
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,750
restricted domain where the meaning of

388
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,360
the class has

389
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,790
mutually agreed upon and I interpreted

390
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,589
this as like as a warning like don't

391
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:33,750
give up the universal semantics of HTML

392
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,040
this thing that we can sort of pass

393
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,329
around and everyone can have this common

394
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,459
language for a domain-specific language

395
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:39,839
that you're going to you know you and

396
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,860
your friends who are working on this

397
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,070
website have agreed upon but I think it

398
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,360
contains the seed of an idea that we

399
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,850
abandoned as we've kind of like taking

400
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,019
on this more dogmatic approach to how

401
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,060
you write HTML and that's that we can

402
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,970
use at the main specific we can use the

403
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,829
main specific meaning if we need to and

404
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,110
it's particularly useful we want to

405
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,160
reflect a structure of our presentation

406
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,630
in a way that is separate from the

407
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,910
content because semantics aren't just

408
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,459
for HTML semantics is just meaning so we

409
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:06,930
can have like presentational semantics

410
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,370
as well I think so I hope I showed that

411
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,540
which like last names were created for

412
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,070
us and look for machines that the

413
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,269
content layer semantics are already

414
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:18,240
dealt with by HTML and that basically

415
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,190
class names in part no real semantic

416
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,350
meaning two machines at all apart from

417
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,850
their kind of co-option with

418
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,910
microformats and so the purpose of a

419
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,529
class is really for us to have like a

420
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:30,240
hook so that we can feed CSS and

421
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,620
JavaScript like attached CSS and

422
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,449
JavaScript to you when you start writing

423
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:37,860
your code a bit like this where you just

424
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,070
think well I'm going to use the class to

425
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,290
basically codify a pattern and I'm just

426
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,390
going to basically imagine this design

427
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,769
is just grey boxes i'm not going to

428
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,079
think oh this is a tweet then you can

429
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,940
end up with these modules these little

430
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,529
chunks of CSS and HTML that are really

431
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:53,699
reusable because they're kind of didn't

432
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:54,870
really care what's inside them they just

433
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,029
provide you this structure and so it

434
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,320
doesn't really matter which application

435
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,250
you're working on which part of the

436
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,750
application you're working in you don't

437
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,900
have to constantly rebuild that

438
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,030
so ugly class names the things that

439
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,700
don't look like this at the moment kind

440
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,010
of we there's a tendency to use hyphens

441
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,750
as just word separators basically we

442
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,830
don't really do anything with the class

443
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,840
other than sort of dream it up and think

444
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,150
well this is a this is a class that's

445
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,730
appropriate for what I'm trying to do

446
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,650
you end up with CSS that maps that was a

447
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,840
bit like this where you have your

448
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,850
generic components some kind of

449
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,290
modifiers sometimes you might end up

450
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,840
with it as a chain in class and this is

451
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,700
fine when you're working on a small

452
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,900
scale but as soon as you start working

453
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,060
on larger scale you have like hundreds

454
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,230
and hundreds and hundreds of components

455
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,560
and you have dozens of developers

456
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,700
varying levels of expertise and

457
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,440
experience then it can be quite hard to

458
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,460
to understand when you're reading piece

459
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,250
of Dom like which parts of the Dom like

460
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,780
basically have style control over others

461
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,510
so this bottom group here that's kind of

462
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,740
reaching into an item which is just

463
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,900
purely a descendant so at some point I

464
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,520
just have to make an implicit

465
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,110
association between item and button

466
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,030
group there's no guarantee that maybe

467
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,230
that button group isn't within another

468
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,700
component that also reaches into a

469
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,900
descendant called item but does

470
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,360
something different or if I have button

471
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,860
primary and item all mixed in on the

472
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,290
same download so when I read the CSS ah

473
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,210
of course button and primary associated

474
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,550
but if I button primary an item you know

475
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,290
I have to come make this mapping in my

476
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,360
mind constantly between the CSS that

477
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,130
I've got and the Dom that I have and

478
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,650
kind of try and keep the kind of

479
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,180
association between the two like tightly

480
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,750
coupled in my head and this approach I

481
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,000
found not to be very optimal where is

482
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,980
something like this which if you saw the

483
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,770
top coat talk they kind of talked about

484
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,810
this sort of type of naming convention

485
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,170
which I adapted from the and exs web

486
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,780
architecture that Y and X is as big

487
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,920
company that they build like search

488
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,360
engines or something in Russia and they

489
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,070
have a lot of developers and lot of

490
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,790
websites and this is there like the

491
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,110
latest notation that i've been using

492
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,510
which I stole from montage s which is

493
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,790
another framework and they kind of like

494
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,829
rift with the notation that I wrote

495
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,600
about and came up with this one which i

496
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,730
think is a bit more readable what it

497
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,650
ends up doing is well first of all it

498
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,390
flattens the your selected so everything

499
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,069
has the same specificity so you can kind

500
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,150
of avoid some of the more complex

501
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,490
aspects of working with the Cascade

502
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,370
then it takes every class and tries to

503
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,620
make an explicit association between the

504
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,540
component that owns it in effect and

505
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,730
then the kind of other aspects of that

506
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,040
component so a double hyphen in this

507
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,230
case is used to indicate a modifier so

508
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,179
when i read that class is telling me i

509
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,340
am modifying the button component and

510
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,590
wherever I see button group item thus

511
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,410
indicating a descendant relationship and

512
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,730
it's telling me i'm a descendant and

513
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,890
button group so i know that exactly

514
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,390
what's controlling it and i can try and

515
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,010
avoid if necessary mixing components on

516
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,540
the same Dom node if it kind of helps me

517
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,640
to avoid like things that I'm trying to

518
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,950
like to try and preserve the integrity

519
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,900
of my UI in effect you end up with HTML

520
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,150
that looks a bit like this we have

521
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,770
button group button group heightened

522
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,780
like that is the main sort of structure

523
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,190
of this one component and then inside it

524
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,470
can be well anything but I mean in this

525
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,820
case it's pretty clearly designed to

526
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,350
have a button inside it but the button

527
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,400
component doesn't really know anything

528
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,929
of the button blue component which is

529
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,950
kind of how you want it you want to be

530
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,050
able to write these things in isolation

531
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,610
as much as possible to try and chew off

532
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,230
small parts of the problem rather than

533
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,880
deal with like the whole you I will at

534
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,570
once and as Ryan said earlier ripped

535
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,360
this from earlier today he says like if

536
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,350
you haven't tried if you think of a

537
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,150
boast then you might not have tried it

538
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,920
and so this kind of running theme but

539
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,750
I've got of try these things out don't

540
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,190
necessarily don't dismiss them

541
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,690
immediately because it's unfamiliar to

542
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,400
you give it a try and like my first

543
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,830
reaction was like oh god no but then you

544
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,140
try it like oh yeah this helps like so

545
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,890
some of the problems that I'm

546
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,059
experiencing and makes my life a bit

547
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,970
easier the nice thing about working like

548
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,309
this i found is that i can build these

549
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:56,440
things as standalone components so i

550
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,130
just have a github repo with the CSS and

551
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,170
a test file to sort of test for

552
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,790
regressions when i change the code in

553
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,980
though and that's it it's basically two

554
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,450
files and the rest is just like croft

555
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,809
for for github and it's just a so I've

556
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:12,910
had that packed up into a reusable

557
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,890
component which is like a bower package

558
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,140
which is a package manager and then I

559
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,380
can include it like this so i have so

560
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,010
suit is like the this kind of no toolkit

561
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,510
thing that I'm working on that I used to

562
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,010
try and store all these components that

563
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,350
helped me with my dev work and all it is

564
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,970
it's basically a file that just says

565
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,870
these are the dependence

566
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,280
is that I have and it just pulls in all

567
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,510
these other components that I have and

568
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,510
the suit utils itself is another like

569
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,550
six or seven packages so I kind of just

570
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,010
build up this tree of packages and I can

571
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,720
use them piecemeal like one at a time if

572
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,820
I want and I kind of just use this all

573
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,740
the time now they haven't written CSS

574
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,960
for a button for about a year since I

575
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,850
wrote the original suit button I kind of

576
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,990
just tweaked it when I need to but

577
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,850
whenever I need a button I just import

578
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,400
this and it gives me the structural

579
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,660
foundations for a button and then I can

580
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,640
add some style and stuff later like

581
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,059
theming style those later so in the

582
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:06,190
context of the current development

583
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,140
environment this is quite useful because

584
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,150
it helps me to communicate

585
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,200
presentational structure between the

586
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,850
rest of the team and it can kind of

587
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,290
happen independently of your somatic a

588
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,090
Chanel so you can still keep all of the

589
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,940
you know articles and lists and all that

590
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,320
that you need but then you just kind of

591
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,840
move the styling layer into its own and

592
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,100
so its own semantic layer we don't

593
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,750
really rely on a specific Dom you just

594
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,040
want to kind of have these chunks that

595
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,170
simply give you a presentation no matter

596
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,400
what the DOM is underneath it so this

597
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,610
ties into a related commandment which is

598
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,660
that we shouldn't be using extra

599
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,740
elements and this is something I really

600
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,090
believe that I really hope to champion

601
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,280
the use of pseudo elements for visual

602
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,950
detail ever extra elements but I really

603
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,880
don't like working like this anymore

604
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,440
there's kind of like too much magic

605
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,780
going on and best of this you develop

606
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,420
element you get one extra element and a

607
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,410
lot of the time you want to do something

608
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,500
a bit more interesting so this is how I

609
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,900
might write some code now where I have

610
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,850
like this generic box component and then

611
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,220
all i know is that box has an optional

612
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,050
item in it which is going to be a close

613
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,910
button which is i'm going to use the box

614
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,950
close to like position the close button

615
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,840
up in the corner and then everything in

616
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,910
there it doesn't know about it at all so

617
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,880
i have button which you know keep the

618
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,530
semantics of like a button element but

619
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,910
then I throw some other stuff on there

620
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,290
so I'm like I want to reset that button

621
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,520
to just look like a piece of texts

622
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,780
because I don't want all the border and

623
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,770
the padding and everything that comes

624
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,710
with it and then I'm going to add some

625
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,520
JavaScript into that but I don't a

626
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,020
couple the JavaScript in my presentation

627
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,110
because you know maybe I'll change that

628
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,870
text like class later and then inside

629
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,670
there I have a standalone component

630
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,290
which is an icon which again there's

631
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,429
nothing about everything like this going

632
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:44,200
on outside of it you can tell that i

633
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,730
have like a modified version of an eye

634
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,260
which is a close icon and that might

635
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,430
have an icon front or something in there

636
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,400
and then a help class to like basically

637
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,230
pull this text off-screen so I just end

638
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,090
up with like for example across in the

639
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,920
corner but screen readers will still be

640
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,540
able to sort of know that it's a close

641
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,880
button so this is kind of quite easy to

642
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,010
read once you get used to it it's kind

643
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,160
of easy to build up like this piece of

644
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,360
you I without having to write any extra

645
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,370
CSS which is something I really try and

646
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,810
avoid to do these doing these days

647
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,640
because like I said a kind of dirty like

648
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,070
CSS at the moment but it's a bit clunky

649
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,430
and messy fortunately it's not 1996

650
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,320
anymore and we've got templating engines

651
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,940
so you can just like hide the

652
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,450
implementation details in a partial and

653
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,250
if I use template inheritance and I can

654
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,870
also specify a part of this component

655
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,300
where something else can live so what i

656
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,720
end up with is somewhere else in my UI

657
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,250
somewhere else in my application i have

658
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,070
a specific part of the UI that just says

659
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,270
i'm going to inherit this shared

660
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,490
component which is like a box with a

661
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,920
close button and then every other part

662
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,150
of the UI that wants to use a box with a

663
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,470
closed bottom can just inherit this

664
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,670
share template I don't have to keep

665
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,070
writing the same class all over my code

666
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,440
making it hard to kind of modify this

667
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,060
piece of view I when I want to make a

668
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,870
change so this is also kind of nice but

669
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,580
we're working with strings and not dong

670
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,190
which is unfortunate there are

671
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,480
frameworks that size that this like

672
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,100
angularjs which is this kind of really

673
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,510
forward-thinking framework that's trying

674
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,520
to look at how the web might be and give

675
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,860
you like kind of remove a lot of the

676
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,270
boilerplate like this stuff which relies

677
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,590
on like a client side templating engine

678
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,450
room or a server-side templating engine

679
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,840
a bunch of conventions this kind of

680
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,760
custom syntax which means that when I

681
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,770
make a component I can't just kind of

682
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,140
give you a way to use it because we're

683
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,420
not really just working with CSS working

684
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,730
with HTML and CSS so I go here's the CSS

685
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,470
like good luck go and write the HTML

686
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,270
yourself and you know I hope it works

687
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,940
out and so the real problem is that we

688
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,220
don't have any encapsulation with CSS so

689
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,340
I can't just create a piece of HTML some

690
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,750
styles and give it to you because you

691
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,210
have to basically buy into the full like

692
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,280
an architectural principle that I've

693
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,980
laid out in order to avoid having Styles

694
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,290
cross these component boundaries which

695
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,430
means it's very hard to have confidence

696
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,150
when you're working in an application

697
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,680
when you drop something in when you

698
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,880
create something for the first time that

699
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,260
it's not going to be affected when

700
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,520
someone goes and works on a seemingly

701
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,440
unrelated part of the UI and ends up

702
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,920
blowing up your website and you know

703
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,600
unfortunately these are desperate

704
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,830
measures that we have to take all this

705
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,840
kind of like ridiculous I mean it kind

706
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,100
of feels ridiculous once you get down

707
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,320
this once you start building it out on

708
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,910
like the level of the deal with large

709
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,680
web applications we have dozens and

710
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,020
dozens and dozens of these templates and

711
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,970
blobs of CSS and then one day someone's

712
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,020
like yo we're redesigning the website

713
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,450
and you have to start again from scratch

714
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,830
or something like that and it's kind of

715
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,700
it's very difficult and so protecting

716
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,260
against different Dom permutations and

717
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,210
all of that is very difficult even for

718
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,050
experienced developers and most of us

719
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,480
maybe have some like familiarity with it

720
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,760
but it's kind of bizarre that some of us

721
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,550
have built entire careers around like

722
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,800
that stuff which is basically nothing

723
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,480
more than trying to defend against all

724
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,400
of the flaws that we experience working

725
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,480
with CSS and HTML but fortunately web

726
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,710
components coming along and they're

727
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,360
going to make like my entire skill set

728
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,880
obsolete because what they're going to

729
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,710
do is push a lot of this into the native

730
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,690
web platform and restore some of my

731
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,610
sanity they're going to add a bunch of

732
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,510
powerful features including

733
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,400
encapsulation when you start looking

734
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,600
through your web components and the

735
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,310
specifications for them it kind of

736
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,790
really highlights the fact that it's you

737
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,260
know we can't just continue to work the

738
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,680
way that we did back in you know as a

739
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,840
reaction against the pre CSS days

740
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,490
because things are going to change like

741
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,950
radically and so all those mistakes that

742
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,900
we've been making well not mistake but

743
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,990
the strong reaction against the pre CSS

744
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,920
authoring days that led to these

745
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,720
dogmatic approaches that were difficult

746
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,070
to work within that we've spent the last

747
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,380
five or more years trying to extract

748
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,700
ourselves from we're going to go through

749
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,890
another period of that coming up with

750
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,630
web components some of it's going to

751
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,130
make our lives much easier but I'm sure

752
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,270
there's going to be plenty of things

753
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,490
that will do that will throw away a lot

754
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,510
of the stuff that we're doing now would

755
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,190
perhaps some of those ideas deserve to

756
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,840
live on and we should maybe be a little

757
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,810
bit careful with that

758
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,080
so the promise of web components is that

759
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,090
they're going to help us make these like

760
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,230
visually rich you is that we're

761
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,460
basically not capable of doing at the

762
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,740
moment and the way that they hope to do

763
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,320
that is by basically relying on more

764
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,720
markup were but the but inside all of

765
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,790
that is this promise of encapsulation

766
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,500
interoperability and reuse which are the

767
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,720
main problems you know almost everything

768
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,240
we've been hearing today I mean

769
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,260
obviously apart from the performance

770
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,820
stuff in that is based around like

771
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,590
attempts to try and solve these problems

772
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,590
attempts to provide a way sorry didn't

773
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,850
meet the dish you I meant I meant really

774
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,700
good way but yeah it's an attempt to

775
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,070
decides that this problem an attempt to

776
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,070
pretend that we don't have to kind of be

777
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,870
aware of how an entire application is

778
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,670
put together in order to work with CSS

779
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,010
and dong and so what web components

780
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,059
going to provide us with is native

781
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:48,670
templating so we don't have to rely on

782
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,220
kind of your client side templating or

783
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,390
server-side templating language of

784
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,150
choice library of choice encapsulation

785
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,100
for CSS and JavaScript custom elements

786
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,960
so we can kind of define our own bits of

787
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,210
the UI and HTML imports that help kind

788
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,460
of make all the shareable the three key

789
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,470
parts of that the shadow Dom which is

790
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,190
the bit that's going to give us

791
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,260
encapsulation and kind of provide these

792
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,910
Dom boundaries which is what I said that

793
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,070
CSS sucks it kind of does but it's

794
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,080
because we can't basically contain it

795
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,850
within a certain chunk of Dom so it's

796
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,350
kind of a it's the two together that's

797
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,110
the problem element which is how we're

798
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,370
going to define custom elements and

799
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,740
extend native elements and template

800
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,850
which is going to be the part that gives

801
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,280
you like these inner parts have gone so

802
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,350
you can just work directly with Dom you

803
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,870
don't have to have strings or work with

804
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,250
Don but try and like hide it somewhere

805
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,840
in a script tag and then hope that it

806
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,809
doesn't slow the passing down so the way

807
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:40,130
that that close button might be

808
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,470
implemented in this contrived example is

809
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,330
like this so I have extend I have

810
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,620
element in which I'm telling is

811
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,450
expending the native button element and

812
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,700
then this template which is going to be

813
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,920
the part that like stamps out DOM and

814
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,660
styles and stuff for me whenever I need

815
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,990
to whenever I call on it to be used and

816
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,460
I can sort of control the appearance of

817
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,730
the of the template by sort of attaching

818
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,500
this I think this is correct at the

819
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,120
moment like at host so I tell we liked

820
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,559
the button that I am like making

821
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,299
not look like a button do some other

822
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:09,350
stuff and then there's like another

823
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,470
custom element in there icon which I use

824
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,879
which is just another basically one of

825
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:15,860
these but like encapsulated and hidden

826
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,960
somewhere else this is going to help

827
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,580
kind of push these implementation

828
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,529
details somewhere else again in the same

829
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:23,210
way that we use the partial but provide

830
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,340
us with much nicer interface you can see

831
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,249
we're kind of back to you know what it

832
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,480
was like when you first started which is

833
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,669
you just have a small chunk of CSS and

834
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,320
lower bolt on and a small chunk of

835
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,730
JavaScript and there's a single file and

836
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,110
everything that you need to know about

837
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,710
that this element is in one file and I

838
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,509
can control the level of styles that

839
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:43,100
flow in and out of this element and I

840
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,269
can have confidence that when I write

841
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,399
some code here that it's going to be

842
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,629
protected which means that I can

843
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:48,889
suddenly take it and give it to someone

844
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:50,629
else because it's part of the web

845
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,940
platform as well means that anyone he'll

846
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,320
be working like this we can all write

847
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,759
our own widgets and share them around at

848
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,820
least that's the that's the hope and the

849
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,860
google chrome guys have had this really

850
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,850
nice term for this which is like the

851
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,039
clarity of renaissance like a return to

852
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,230
relying on like attributes and piping

853
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,360
data in like that using markup because

854
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,860
it's okay this is going to be hidden in

855
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,690
a shadow Dom that will never be seen at

856
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,100
the next layer of my application when I

857
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,619
make use of this custom element like

858
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:17,570
this but like I said it's like a

859
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,009
Renaissance for CSS because we can go

860
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,659
back to you trusting it and almost

861
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,639
anyone could work with CSS that problem

862
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:25,970
of the well-meaning developer in like

863
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,649
the backend team you has to put a quick

864
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:29,570
patch in or who has to implement some

865
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,850
new feature who accidentally blows up

866
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,710
part of the site well you know having to

867
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,999
rely on visual differing tools for your

868
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:37,070
entire website in order to be confident

869
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,929
you haven't destroyed some distant part

870
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:40,850
of it that is hopefully going to go away

871
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,999
and obviously this is dawn so well

872
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,919
that's much nicer but this isn't

873
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,659
entirely new because as I showed we're

874
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:49,190
trying to do something like this at the

875
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,720
moment with the tools that we've kind of

876
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,059
built for ourselves but the developer

877
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,669
their browser vendors have also been

878
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,799
doing this so if you bust out chrome

879
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,539
canary and then go into the dev tools

880
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,940
and turn on show shadow Dom then you can

881
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,249
inspect some elements so if you look at

882
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,139
the video element or some of these input

883
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,639
elements like the day Telamon and you

884
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,259
can see their implementation of it

885
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:10,970
behind the scenes and this document

886
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,470
fragment is basically saying I'm shadow

887
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,820
DOM and that's the part that we never

888
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,919
see but is it exposing it you can see

889
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,429
it's just basically a bunch of divs some

890
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:20,120
accessibility hope

891
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,580
some ways of exposing parts of the

892
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,110
shadow Dom to be styled outside of the

893
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,670
shadow Dom but only if you specifically

894
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,770
asked for it like if I just said they've

895
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,120
read it's not going to affect any of

896
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,890
this so they have this encapsulation and

897
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,600
they're basically going to be giving it

898
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,970
to it giving it to us and hopefully

899
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:35,900
that's going to make our lives much

900
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,980
easier so it's okay to use extra

901
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,170
elements we have been for a while and we

902
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,670
probably will be further foreseeable

903
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,770
future well we're coming full circle so

904
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,900
now we have CSS and JavaScript in our

905
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,730
HTML templates again they're not we're

906
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,260
not well we probably aren't going to

907
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,900
have huge style sheets with all of the

908
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,090
style you know somewhere else all the

909
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,030
JavaScript somewhere else and then a big

910
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,470
directory full of templates it's going

911
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,940
to be this small components but

912
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,430
basically to take a web app and scale

913
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,920
that down so that everything is like a

914
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,900
small element in effect and our web apps

915
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,220
will just be a collection of elements

916
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,200
where each layer kind of hiding some of

917
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,340
the implementation details that we don't

918
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,480
need to know about the layer that we're

919
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,580
working in this is going to completely

920
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,740
change our jobs which means that we have

921
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,600
to be prepared to Diaz Heraclitus said

922
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,170
and to step back into the river so we

923
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,760
have to challenge the assumptions that

924
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,200
we're kind of taking with us now because

925
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,940
they're definitely going to change some

926
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,080
of the assumptions that will sort of

927
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,280
develop as we're working with this are

928
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,950
also going to be things that we should

929
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,330
sort of have a second think about before

930
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,250
kind of bashing other people over the

931
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,510
head with them and making the same

932
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,400
mistakes that we did last time around

933
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,170
which is someone comes along try

934
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,150
something out we ask them for not doing

935
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,320
it in the way that we have decided is

936
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,530
the way to be so be open to the way be

937
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,420
open to suggestions from others and the

938
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,970
way that other people like to do things

939
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,210
be prepared to be wrong I guess and to

940
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,920
not just imitate others but to have a

941
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,290
think for yourself about you know what

942
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,520
is it what is the context that i'm

943
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,470
working in now you know is that this is

944
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,280
a problem they're trying to solve the

945
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,770
same problem as I'm trying to solve and

946
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,940
you prepared to have all of your

947
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,670
projects and ideas washed away like the

948
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,530
time like most of the stuff I've worked

949
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,650
on is not going to be relevant in the

950
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,330
next few years and like I'm okay with

951
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,100
that because you know there's no point

952
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,150
clinging on to things that were designed

953
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,880
to work in a different hero I think

954
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,280
that's the main way to avoid basically

955
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,320
stagnating to enjoy working with other

956
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,909
people and to have any hope
