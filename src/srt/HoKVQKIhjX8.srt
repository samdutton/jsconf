10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:42,250
the last hour and okay so I am from I

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,130
just came to Germany like before five

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,320
years five five months ago and and I

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,840
came exactly from the city of Aleppo

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,460
which is the heart of the world that's

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,890
going on right now as you as you know

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,840
and this is my city it's a lovely City

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,360
before the war I don't know why I told

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,160
you it's presentation okay

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,820
and this is our like awesome great

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,040
castle of Aleppo and this is my city

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,970
right now after the war as you see it

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,240
it's totally destroyed also here again

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,240
but I'm not showing you those photos -

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,549
like - because every time I read an

25
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:40,600
article regarding refugees the the guys

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,630
that make our write those articles they

27
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,729
are like really like most of the time

28
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,500
they are really sweet and awesome but

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,369
they tend to tell stories that are

30
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,479
emotional and sentimental just to make

31
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,920
the people you know feel sorry this is

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,750
not my intention at all and to be

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,909
bluntly honest I really don't like it

34
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,460
when somebody comes at me and just and

35
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,250
just speaks in a like his feels like

36
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,350
really sorry so I don't want you to feel

37
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,110
sorry but I actually my intention was

38
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,380
maybe and hopefully to change the way

39
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,090
you look and see refugees here in

40
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,740
Germany as you may there is a lot of as

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,129
you may have known

42
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:23,650
there's a lot of controversy regarding

43
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,569
the refugees that the huge amount of

44
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:29,769
images that are coming to Germany and I

45
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,430
just hope by giving this representation

46
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,249
to make make you maybe feel like the

47
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:40,250
refugees can be a can be a huge

48
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,590
opportunity for Germany and if they are

49
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,950
put in the right use and they can really

50
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,319
help push the economic wheel of this

51
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,359
really awesome country that I literally

52
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:53,090
fallen in love with over the last five

53
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,909
months and I really like consider it as

54
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:03,330
my second home right now

55
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,280
well so you saw the the the photos of my

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,139
city Aleppo so I you may think like here

57
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,099
you know the it's not a five star living

58
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:19,430
there is no electricity so if you are a

59
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,629
programmer I guess you need some

60
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,819
electricity too but there is no

61
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,069
electricity at all and you can't Google

62
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,750
anything and most of the work that I do

63
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,810
is always googling stuff because that's

64
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,310
the way how I work and I think most of

65
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,069
you guys also work the same so there is

66
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:36,169
no electricity there is no water and you

67
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:38,689
have to do like every I I used to hate

68
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,870
this like every morning I have to go and

69
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,750
just bring water from a place where

70
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,099
there is so many people but I have to

71
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,509
find a way to come where there is not so

72
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:50,000
many people and just bring water for

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,900
this day and mmm I told you so I mean

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,889
there is no if you see there's no

75
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:56,959
internet and there is no water but what

76
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:57,769
was I doing there

77
00:03:57,769 --> 00:03:59,840
I stayed there actually I was there in

78
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,669
Aleppo when the war actually started

79
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:06,290
when I was 17 years old I was there we

80
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,750
have you know like this at the last year

81
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,129
of high school where you have to be do

82
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:13,310
this big exam in Syria and you have to

83
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,870
study really really hard for like one

84
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,159
year so if you want to get into a good

85
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:19,400
faculty so at this time when I was

86
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,669
preparing for this because I want you to

87
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:23,509
you know to study informatics

88
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,219
engineering and you have to bring very

89
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,570
high marks so you can get into this

90
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,780
faculty in Syria and just so you know

91
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,630
actually many people in Syria many

92
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,250
attendees of the informatics faculty are

93
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,490
our woman here in Berlin I'm right now

94
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,830
guest student in Berlin and it's the

95
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,900
opposite most of them are guys so I

96
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,550
don't expect that so what was I doing I

97
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,340
was playing games most of the time like

98
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,500
those two just switching between the

99
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,180
richer and the GTA and so this and I was

100
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,030
learning at the University C++ object

101
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,370
oriented programming and Java and some

102
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,890
algorithms but we were learning so many

103
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,130
theoretical stuff like dirt math linear

104
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,740
algebra probabilities all of those crazy

105
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,400
stuff and I really as you may think I

106
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
didn't enjoy them very well because you

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,410
see nothing you just abstract so Unreal

108
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,840
Engine came out at the same time I was

109
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,580
studying those things in Syria where we

110
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,710
had internet for life I guess I was

111
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,900
lucky at the summer we had internet it

112
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,380
was really slow but it was okay so the

113
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,010
Unreal Engine 4 was introduced and I had

114
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,410
I was reading I wanted to apply the C++

115
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,800
so I read about 3d stuff like maybe

116
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,050
using unity or Unreal Engine but then

117
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,370
Unreal Engine 1 because he is using a C+

118
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,710
so I try to make games that I thought I

119
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,050
can make a triple a game maybe like Mass

120
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,100
Effect alone and in three months well I

121
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,180
guess that didn't work very well and

122
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,580
yeah so I made a little game do you like

123
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,340
the zombies took out our our University

124
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,390
and you're gonna have to try to kick

125
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,310
them out the the characters didn't have

126
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,670
really a good look because but it was ok

127
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:17,040
it worked fine and yeah I was just at

128
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,720
that time of the world people outside

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,460
are fighting I was playing GTA was funny

130
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,770
because the voices are mixed some voices

131
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,090
you hear from outside and some voices

132
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,400
from GTA and its really good quite quite

133
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,030
sounds good sound effects and like I

134
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,480
didn't have those 3d like speed

135
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,520
supporters but it was really cool like

136
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
when you hear the blue it's really like

137
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,850
a huge boom so that was the way I was

138
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,680
spending my time and like going to

139
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,430
learning math learning some Java and

140
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,169
staying at home watching The Walking

141
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,910
Dead Game of Thrones and playing those

142
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,980
games and developing Unreal Engine so

143
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,790
that's what I was doing then one day I

144
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,100
was there at university we always used

145
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,990
to go to the architecture faculty

146
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,229
because there most of the hot girls and

147
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:04,699
hot guys they go all there and they

148
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,770
would try to meet each other and you

149
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,870
know do whatever they want to do and so

150
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,669
one of my friends we were there sitting

151
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:15,229
like just checking this girl out and

152
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,970
then he tells me well you know actually

153
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,770
I have this crazy idea we should get out

154
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,290
of here like we weren't doing nothing in

155
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,880
Aleppo I don't know what do you mean

156
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,530
what do what we are doing some stuff he

157
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,630
told me well well we can do something

158
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,720
better here in Europe and he is like

159
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,840
that that time no no no refugees like

160
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,610
this huge amount of people were coming

161
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,990
and nobody knew about this idea so I

162
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,330
thought he was stupid like I'm in Syria

163
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,370
I'm gonna go and just go what I'm gonna

164
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,020
make take a visa or just what I'm gonna

165
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,750
I'm gonna fly take a rocket I can't come

166
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,060
here this is impossible he is crazy yeah

167
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,130
I didn't give give him much attention

168
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,860
and then after two months he comes to me

169
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,510
and tells me I'm gonna say goodbye to

170
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,950
you right now I'm gonna try my luck and

171
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,020
I'm gonna go to Germany but tell him

172
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,780
really and I I took it as a laughs I

173
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,639
think he's gonna come back maybe in one

174
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,760
week and he'll have spent so much money

175
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,940
on nothing and he'll lately later regret

176
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,510
but in 30 days he is in Germany he is

177
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,300
taking photos in Berlin so that was

178
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,520
really like a huge shock to me that was

179
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,250
as you may have mentioned that was

180
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,260
before all of those crazy people were

181
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,789
coming and millions and millions of I

182
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:27,110
don't know if refugees were coming and

183
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,760
it's all over the news that was all

184
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,430
before that so I started like he put

185
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,229
this idea in my mind and I started

186
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:40,099
asking my parents as you know I was when

187
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,599
I started asking them I was 20 right now

188
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,010
in 21 so I like I need I can you I want

189
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,620
to go to Germany you know what are you

190
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,700
talking about just just yeah just get

191
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,160
past the eyeliner algebra and then we'll

192
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,060
talk about it and then

193
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,250
and then summer car came and so many

194
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,410
people were the news everybody we're

195
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,180
talking about how all of those people

196
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,670
are all of those refugees are coming to

197
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,730
Europe and they were like so awesome

198
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,140
here like as you see our Europe is

199
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,590
without borders and then this refugees

200
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,340
welcome stuff so the idea wasn't really

201
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,150
that crazy then my father started you

202
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,060
know thinking about it one of you huge

203
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,730
one of the huge barriers also was the

204
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,850
money because you needed my father is a

205
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,330
lawyer

206
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,670
but you know right now there is no law

207
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,170
in Syria I guess and a lawyer wouldn't

208
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,160
work as well as before you know this

209
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,230
destruction I wasn't living there I was

210
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,550
living here in the same city but it is

211
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,130
you know separated so I was I was lucky

212
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,980
and to be living in a another part of

213
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,960
the city that is more fortunate that it

214
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,560
is a bit more safe so to say like only

215
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,910
one rocket today and then then he

216
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,410
actually agreed I don't know how like as

217
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,070
I'm okay you need maybe two thousand

218
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,520
dollars to to make the trip and then he

219
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,240
agreed and then I told him can I take my

220
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,330
brother because my brother with me he

221
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,710
told me now if you want to try this you

222
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,930
will try this on your own and before he

223
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,880
changed my mind I just did I took

224
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,160
everything I packed my stuff and I was

225
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,170
out and I didn't believe it I thought

226
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,780
like Oh God really then I took the the I

227
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,400
got out of Syria which was really the

228
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,290
hardest part the sea was nothing I also

229
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,030
I told my father actually one of the way

230
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,850
that I I convinced him I told him if you

231
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,440
don't let me go I'm gonna go just

232
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,940
because you know the most money was

233
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,710
gonna go to the guys that put you in

234
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:56,020
this boat like 1200 for them so if you

235
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,190
don't want to give me the money just

236
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,390
give me less I will go swimming I'm a

237
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,740
really good swimmer eyes in five guys

238
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,200
five five hours a day I can go swimming

239
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,300
you can see I mean the island it's just

240
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,560
over there and I guess he

241
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,050
and then after you get to Greece you

242
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,970
start you know sneaking across the

243
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,819
borders and just getting a country of

244
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:19,620
three country and then after 15 16 days

245
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,579
I'm here in Berlin

246
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,220

some English instead of argument and so

301
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,860
I had to do the obvious thing and try to

302
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,640
learn German and well this is just a

303
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,970

312
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,080
passion I didn't come to Germany just to

313
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,310
learn German I want to continue

314
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,490
programming so but I didn't have I had a

315
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,010
really cool rig back in Syria I got a

316
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,650
computer like with GPU GTX I don't know

317
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,110
what I forgot 560 it was really good rig

318
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,400
but here I don't have a laptop and I

319
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,920
don't have a PC I'm not gonna take my

320
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,930
rig with me in the boat and just come

321
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:49,890
over here so I thought about it I

322
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,110
thought about it it's a really good

323
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,550
drink but they would take much money to

324
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,780
bring it it would be a person so a good

325
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,790
friend of mine that that I got to know

326
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,740
orange and Berlin just two weeks after

327
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,770
three weeks and I'm in Berlin she sends

328
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,210
me a message or sends my friend a

329
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,120
message and then he sends me the message

330
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,070
there she says that there is this new

331
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,650
school it's called ready school which

332
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,710
will give laptops for for you guys and

333
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,050
for everybody not only mostly refugees

334
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,340
it will give you laptops they're not the

335
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,170
best laptops this is their laptop that

336
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,910
they give me that they gave me and they

337
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,580
will teach you programming if you are if

338
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,990
you already know some programming there

339
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,880
is an advanced course and if you are

340
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,680
total beginner there is a beginner

341
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,010
course so I say well I don't think that

342
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,330
they're gonna give me a laptop but I

343
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,520
will go I have only German I will go

two months they opened the school it was

346
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,940
really just the beginning they were just

347
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,890
far they are trying to figure the idea

348
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,680
that school is going to work and they

349
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,879
decided to teach us Ruby on Rails

350
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:11,809
and they made a good argument about it

351
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,910
and I said well you're going to teach us

352
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,600
to be on wheels it's okay and we go we

353
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,459
start learning Ruby on Rails and they

354
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,689
bring mentors you know the mentors

355
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,089
they're gonna they are volunteers that

356
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,889
just wanna spread the knowledge and then

357
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:31,939
there is this - guys the what - every

358
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:33,529

is better and his name is Peter and he

363
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:51,169
instead he he tells the people at the

364
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:52,910
school we are learning Ruby on Rails but

365
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,850
in the in the session we are learning

366
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:03,619
JavaScript I mean I mean when I when she

367
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:06,620
asked they asked me the like hey so how

368
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,089
is it going with you guys with the Ruby

369
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:08,480
on Rails

370
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,630
well I we are learning JavaScript well

371
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,549
really well we have to talk with this

00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,850
guy and then I got him fired no no no

373
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:22,279
I'm just kidding and yeah so I liked

374
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,260
JavaScript actually more than Ruby on

375
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,389
Rails and I really enjoyed meteor

376
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:28,549
because you can make stuff very fast and

377
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,480
see the results in front of you and the

378
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,630

393
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,160
wake up and I check my

394
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,200
phone and I see like it's exploding with

395
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,860
messages and like many people are

396
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,080

397
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,170

398
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,470

somebody I don't know and then but so I

408
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,160

409
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,230
ad school they didn't tell me I just

410
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,030

413
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,070
I asked a friend of mine who is also in

415
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,690

417
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:26,120

419
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,290
been calling everybody even in Syria

420
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,780

422
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,170
tomorrow well they told me not to see

423
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,030
anybody so please don't tell anybody so

424
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,850
and then he's telling other people so on

425
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,280
the next day actually all of this talk

426
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,970
they didn't get this and I met him and

427
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,580
we had a good talk about virtual reality

428
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,190
and about like if I asked him the normal

429
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,900
question that everybody asks him should

430
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,030
I continue college and stuff like

431
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,540
regarding that he didn't and yeah it was

432
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,570
a good half an hour and we discussed

433
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,990
many stuff like JavaScript a thing that

434
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,850
I'm the stuff and that I'm learning and

435
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,330
Unreal Engine and he yes and he actually

436
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,180
told me to use it's a good idea to use

437
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,770
Unreal Engine to develop stuff for the

438
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:22,030
VR and then this is a crazy photo of me

439
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,670
well I thought I was then working on

440
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,470
meteor to make a site for the already

441
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,680
school it's not deployed or saw anything

442
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,640
I just was doing at trying to you like

443
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,420
better

444
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,300
my knowledge using the JavaScript and

445
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,150
meteor and I I don't know why I did I

446
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,820
think that one laptop wasn't enough and

447
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,100
I don't know and actually my friend also

448
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,350
the one who is helping me thought the

449
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,000
same thing that one laptop ain't enough

450
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,800
and so we actually made a media website

451
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,610
that has you know like registration and

452
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,120
user interface and like a profile pages

453
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,980
for everybody is like a mini Facebook

454
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,320
and in use feed and stuff using MongoDB

455
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:14,390
and Ruby JavaScript and meat here and it

456
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,560
was actually good for like I did it in

457
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,760
actually three weeks just refreshing my

458
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,830
memories about the pay basics and then

459
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,110
learning the meteor and JavaScript and

460
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,640
MongoDB because I have no idea about

461
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,840
databases and we made the side the

462
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,950
source is not is not pretty but it works

463
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,440
and then before two days ago

464
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,710
we were having a discussion with well 20

465
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,590
and 24 we were going to also make a

466
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,230
webpage on their side like not whole

467
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,380
page menus many web pages like it's a

468
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,960
mini site in their site

469
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,350
- yeah using javascript and using meat

470
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:05,260
here and I will be also continuing

471
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,540

now you know trying to learn the

474
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,030
language I understand many like 60% e %

475
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,470
of the what's the professor is saying

476
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,250
but I still need more and I will not be

477
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,710
official until I have a certain level so

478
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,080

hope that you liked it and if you have

483
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,730
any I don't know

484
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,940
we have yeah we still have time I guess

485
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,880
I thought it would take more yeah if you

486
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,429
have any questions or anything I'd be

487
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:56,340
happy to answer them or try to answer

488
00:22:56,340 --> 00:24:37,740
them

489
00:24:37,750 --> 00:25:15,220
like

490
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,850
well this is actually the first time I

491
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,070
hear is that human because I wouldn't be

492
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,080
given a visa or anybody I mean I'm not a

493
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,289
super techy guy but maybe I will earn

494
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:28,650
fast I guess but regarding the second

495
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,830
question I know that there is like

496
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,950
43,000 job opportunities for programmers

497
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,450
here in Germany that are not fulfilled

498
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,690
and they need anybody who who can do

499
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,120
this any job and I so like many people

500
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,750
came to our many companies came to our

501
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,460
school and they asked us and we are

502
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,929
still learning and the ask has just come

503
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:54,350
you will learn on the job well it's not

504
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,240
well what do you think so many the

505
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,130
system is not working I guess very well

506
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,320
when because I think there is many

507
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,380
refugees that are coming but I mean I

508
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,679
did I don't have a residency until now

509
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,070
nobody like many people who don't know

510
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,659
don't can't can't speak English can't

511
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,580
program anything can't do anything

512
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,409
they got the residency they are just

513
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,640
like me also from Syria or other

514
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,890
countries I think they are refugees they

515
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,870
got the residency and now they can go to

516
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,780
the do any place to work or anything but

517
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,940
I'm I can work actually do actual work

518
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,440
but I I'm not allowed to work so this is

519
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,960
the the problem like I'm not allowed to

520
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,700
work and I am NOT also given any

521
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,540
residency and what was the first

522
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,720
yeah so many people is there many guys

523
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,910
just like me yes there is many guys but

524
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,980
they're in the shadows because many

525
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,080
doctors are living in camps I saw many

526
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,640
doctors that are ready just to work with

527
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,150
it many engineers the mechanical

528
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,010
engineers many many many people with

529
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,350
educated they are already finished there

530
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,850
they have their degree with them they

531
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:07,820
are ready as our school and but they

532
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,200
didn't like they didn't get any help or

533
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,750
any or any like nobody helped them they

534
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,190
they were helped but they didn't get the

535
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,730
residency to help Germany to help the

536
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,730
economic wheel that's the problem and

537
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,470
there is many people yes there is a I'm

538
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,470
not gonna I want to be very honest I'm

539
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,910
not going to tell you all those all the

540
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,470
refugees that came they are really

541
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,420
educated they are like no no not all of

542
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,570
them and the majority are not I want to

543
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,410
be honest but not everybody not

544
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,180
everybody that came here needs to be a

545
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,340
tech guy or needs to be a doctor or

546
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,810
needs to they can work any other job to

547
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,660
just to not be a burden on Germany to

548
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,250
not keep on taking money I don't like

549
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,690
taking money from the government but

people would like to work but they are

552
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,420
by they didn't learn the language this

553
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,670

offered to learn a language that's all

555
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,270

00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,280
