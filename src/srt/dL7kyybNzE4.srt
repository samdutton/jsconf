2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:17,369
so hello everyone I am Mariana as you

3
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,189
can see these are a few versions of my

4
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,460
name where people love typing them the

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,830
first one is the correct in case you are

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,230
doubting and today I'm gonna share my

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,530
story from upper labs hackerspace so

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,090
upper laps is actually a physical

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,090
community not just an online community

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,280
it's a hackerspace if you if you are

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,559
familiar with the term you probably know

12
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,710
what I'm going to be talking about it is

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,870
a community where we care mostly about

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,940
open source projects these are the main

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,430
pillars what we send and try to promote

16
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,550
which is open source technologists open

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,940
data open technologists under its

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,739
alternative licenses for creative works

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,670
like music and images and designs and

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,090
all of this kind of stuff but how I got

21
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,479
there all started back in 2016 when I

22
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,450
was on my second year on my University

23
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,360
my bachelor set is at that time in March

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,210
a friend of mine called me and told me

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,970
that in two months in May at the time a

26
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,590
conference is going to happen a

27
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,920
conference which is called Oscar open

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,229
source conference Sylvania and they are

29
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,329
looking for volunteers most of the

30
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,299
volunteers usually our students and then

31
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,610
asked her why should I go there why

32
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,250
should I spend my weekend helping you

33
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,229
know a conference I had never been to

34
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,970
one that's true so I followed her advice

35
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,329
I attended the conference I stay there

36
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,079
for two days I met a lot of people from

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,630
different countries who knew a lot of

38
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,060
stuff different kind of stuff and I

39
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,940
realized that tech is so diverse on its

40
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,360
own not only the people that

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,770
says it but also of trying to find what

42
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,270
she liked the most for some of our

43
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,630
people that are coding other that like

44
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,390
system and administration design and

45
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,180
even people who are like more into them

46
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,930
this marketing part there are more

47
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,020
people's person I am NOT I hate public

48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,750
speaking as you can see that is a

49
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,720
picture of that day I am somewhere in

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,890
the middle three years now back to 2019

51
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,230
and I have learned a lot from this

52
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,180
community because later on of course I

53
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,310
joined them and I kept organizing

54
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,709
smaller events rather than just an

55
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,420
annual conference I have met amazing

56
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,140
people I've had the chance to attend

57
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,540
larger events like this one and made

58
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,709
people like you the most important to me

59
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,110
part is that I have become a little bit

60
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,209
more confident for myself not that I

61
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,580
became more smarter than this than then

62
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,239
I'm the same person but just that the

63
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,070
boost you get from these people and

64
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,600
their kind words make you feel more

65
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,930
comfortable about you and also we share

66
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,880
what you know for sharing your story

67
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,940
like these sessions are you sharing your

68
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,730
knowledge and your experience is what

69
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,030
will make people like me at that time be

70
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,380
in a stage like this

71
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,690
a few years later and you can do that

72
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,620
but many many ways a way that I chose to

73
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,970
reshare what I knew was in January when

74
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,489
I found out about this conferences and

75
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,860
before I apply I shared it with my

76
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,260
community we have an online forum that

77
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,630
is course for him and I said that hey

78
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,060
guys like I saw on Twitter that this

79
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,320
conferences are happening they have some

80
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,180
scholarships a good forum I am a scholar

81
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,090
this year I shared the links

82
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,400
unfortunately the CFP was closed at that

83
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,310
time so I just carried for people who

84
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,739
just wanted to come as guests and attend

85
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:20,359
the conferences

86
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,659
so not only meals and other girls

87
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:26,150
applied for the conference and that was

88
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,780
my right way of saying thank you to

89
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,520
these people for everything that I have

90
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,759
done for me and probably give back

91
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,110
something to them that is all for me

92
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,480
thank you
