00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:14,320

[Music]

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,900
so it's a huge crowd which is lovely at

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,080
this time of the day you can come closer

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,699
by the way there's gonna be a little bit

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,820
of life coding so probably like it

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,260
should be large enough but you know we

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,029
have so much space in the front rows

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,430
come on don't like highs in the back I'm

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,829
not gonna ask you questions I totally

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,660
will ask you questions No

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,480
so yeah thank you very much rollin for

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,059
the introduction I'm Martin Schmidt head

13
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,070
of engineering and archaeologic doing a

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,600
little bit of everything in the last

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
couple of month we started off with the

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,530
tool like this this is in a browser so

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,940
you could build and show interiors and

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,149
like offices houses whatever in your

19
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,520
browser and also like walk through them

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,840
furnish them and also do like VR

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,070
experiences in your browser based on

22
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,799
that VR I'm also Google developer expert

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,950
for web technologies and polymer so

24
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,600
that's that's something that I kind of

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,299
want to bring to everyone help them I

26
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,670
want to help you all to build better

27
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,500
stuff on the web and if you have any

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,570
questions I'm happy to help if I can't

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,770
answer them I'm gonna find you someone

30
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,600
who can answer them I also work with the

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,009
Mozilla community and the web standards

32
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,590
community so I try to encourage everyone

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,150
like did you for instance know that all

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,369
the w3c specs and stuff are on github

35
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,229
and you can actually collaborate by

36
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,909
opening issues or pull requests and

37
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,009
stuff so definitely check that out the

38
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,869
next time you see something where you're

39
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,040
like I don't think this is a good

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,470
decision bring up your comments with the

41
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,450
standards bodies because we all need

42
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,700
your input if if we developers want

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,189
better api's we have to give feedback to

44
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,590
the browser vendors so now comes the

45
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,030
boring part of the presentation which is

46
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,549
the introduction to all this because we

47
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,409
kind of want to go right into VR but

48
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,600
let's you know go over a few things that

49
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,729
make it more like reasonable and put

50
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,040
things into context so first things

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,210
first there's a lot of abbreviations

52
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,390
around there acronyms overload right so

53
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,700
we have like virtual reality we have

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,410
augmented reality we have

55
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,670
XR like x-reality what mixed reality and

56
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,830
then what else is there right so how do

57
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,840
these relate to each other so let's

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,010
start with something that is probably

59
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,070
not too new has been around since the

60
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,170
1960s actually when the first couple of

61
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,410
experiments started it's virtual reality

62
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,150
virtual reality is basically

63
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,910
constructing a virtual space that the

64
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,830
user is in so we are basically

65
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,840
completely ignoring the real world

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,400
around us we're completely shutting it

67
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,970
out and building our own little virtual

68
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,000
space what you can use and wander around

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,490
then there's augmented reality which has

70
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,110
become more of a buzzword recently

71
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,330
especially with Apple and Google putting

72
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,970
out a our core and they are KITT

73
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,170
respectively actually a Arkady's apple

74
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,690
and a our core is Google there has been

75
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,030
experiments with like markers before

76
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,560
that but now you can actually just use

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,940
your phone you don't need special

78
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,350
Hardware anymore you can just use a

79
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,890
phone that supports these two like SDKs

80
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,200
or platforms and just tap on something

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,730
and then it figures out where in space

82
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,590
you are so that's pretty cool and the

83
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,450
difference is that we are not shutting

84
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,000
out the world we are using the

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,400
environment that you are in and adding

86
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,440
something to it we augment it so for

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,990
instance you can say one of the first

88
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,580
apps that were probably relatively

89
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,960
popular in Switzerland at least in

90
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,790
Switzerland we have mountains as you

91
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,460
might know and the question and

92
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,290
sometimes is especially for like someone

93
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,970
who's emigrated interest with sidin like

94
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,430
me is what mountain is that so I would

95
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,040
basically bore my friends with friends

96
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,410
to death by what mountain is that aha

97
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,120
mountain is that like a freaking six

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,790
year old and with this augmented reality

99
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,500
what you could do is I could hold up my

100
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,690
phone my phone figures out here's where

101
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,060
I am this is where I'm pointing at so

102
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,700
looking at an database of moms and their

103
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,530
positions and basically triangulating I

104
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,080
show you this is that amount this is the

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,970
Duke pizza for instance or whatever like

106
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,280
this is warm blonde and you can

107
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,350
basically just like use that it augments

108
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,840
my view of reality by embedding

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,760
information into the surroundings that

110
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,420
I'm in at the time all of this is

111
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,419
encapsulated when we talk about both we

112
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,580
don't have to say VR and AR we can say

113
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,660
mixed reality or XR for some reason

114
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,360
so basically it all encompasses both

115
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,340
things that you can also have like other

116
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,620
things you can for instance

117
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,300
hypothetically have VR but embedded

118
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,280
video feed of some other space so then

119
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,660
you would have to be a likely they have

120
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,790
a tiny little bit of virtual reality

121
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,740
with the tiny little bit of like

122
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,540
augmented reality so you can mix them

123
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,250
together so basically when you hear

124
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,780
these terms you should now know that if

125
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,780
I talk about mixed reality or XR I mean

126
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,460
either virtual reality or augmented

127
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,389
reality most specifically VR and AR are

128
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,310
not excluding each other they are not

129
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,160
like competing in the same space there

130
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,690
are two different things

131
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,669
so a lot of people came to me in the

132
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:07,560
last like year or so and asked like

133
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,990
Martin do you think AR is gonna like

134
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,889
kill VR or VR is gonna kill a AR and

135
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,370
like hey do you think carrots will kill

136
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,850
potatoes because it makes no sense to

137
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,860
ask this question really it's not a dumb

138
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,660
question it's just like we haven't done

139
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,490
a good job explaining this and luckily

140
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,380
clay beaver from the Google VR team has

141
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,510
a wonderful explanation so basically in

142
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,120
virtual reality what we do is we take

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,430
you somewhere else

144
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,889
we are constructing a new reality that

145
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,180
is not the reality that you are in right

146
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,130
now so while I'm on stage if I go into

147
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,560
VR I could be on a beach which I would

148
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,620
really enjoy I could be on a really

149
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,120
really high mountain which I would not

150
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
enjoy because being on a high mountain

151
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,180
in t-shirt and shorts is usually not a

152
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,470
good idea

153
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,300
I could be under the sea which I would

154
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,490
probably also not enjoy because I have

155
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,710
to breathe somehow so yeah basically

156
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,830
what it is it is a teleporter it takes

157
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,830
the user using virtual reality somewhere

158
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,539
else it can even be like a Fantasyland

159
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,310
from Alice in Wonderland it doesn't have

160
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,530
to be a real place it can be anything

161
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,470
that I make up they are on the other

162
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,510
hand brings some information bring some

163
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,750
data to me so I'm not teleporting

164
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,760
somewhere else I'm still on stage but I

165
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,169
get an additional information for

166
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,780
instance maybe if I had like magical

167
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,700
goggles like I don't know Google glass

168
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,919
hololens or whatever they could tell me

169
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,190
I don't know the your favorite

170
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,080
Backstreet Boys song or something like

171
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,650
that or maybe I have an app that allows

172
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,450
me to put different things here like

173
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,139
have to

174
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,539
and fake you know virtual people here

175
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,039
sitting here having a panel discussion

176
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,080
or something like that so basically it

177
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,939
brings something to me so it's like

178
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,159
magic x-ray goggles it shows me

179
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,289
information that I'm not seeing normally

180
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:53,669
like x-ray goggles would show me

181
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,259
something that you know is under the

182
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,659
surface they are can surface information

183
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,789
that I'm not having by just using my

184
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,370
natural senses so this is the difference

185
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,319
and now it should become clear that

186
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,529
they're not competing they are come

187
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,180
they're basic aliy completing each other

188
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,219
or like complementing each other really

189
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:13,169
nicely because basically there's two

190
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,400
different use cases and they're

191
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,259
completely different one is bringing

192
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,879
information to me in the situation that

193
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,400
I am right now and you could say like

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,740
basically Google Maps as a augmented

195
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,659
reality application in the broadest

196
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:27,090
sense because it tells me where to go

197
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,680
right so it gives me information that I

198
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,479
don't have at the moment

199
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,229
whereas VR takes me somewhere else

200
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,000
biggest difference so what's the

201
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,580
landscape of we are like at the moment

202
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,259
so what is the kind of like the market

203
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,439
looking like so we have the HTC vive for

204
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,909
instance this is like more or less like

205
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:51,150
a high-power sports car you have these

206
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,009
little trekkers here and here you have

207
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,839
to put them up it's a little hassle to

208
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,069
set that up because you have to

209
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,599
literally like bring it on the wall or

210
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,460
put it on tripods or something but then

211
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,139
you can move along in the room and the

212
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,729
the trackers track you so you actually

213
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,110
know where in the room you are so you

214
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,879
can walk around in a virtual room which

215
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,289
is like super cool you have two

216
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:09,060
controllers with lots of buttons and

217
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,159
touch pads and stuff so you can really

218
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,569
nicely interact with your virtual

219
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,399
environment however that comes as a

220
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,189
prize and the price is quite expensive

221
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:18,330
and it's more or less the same in

222
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,849
dollars probably and then we have this

223
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:23,159
one this is different oh by the way this

224
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,409
one requires a computer that is strong

225
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:26,729
enough to actually power so you need a

226
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:29,159
gaming pc or a gaming laptop so that

227
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,649
laptop is probably around $1000 as well

228
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,110
so like you have to add that on top then

229
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,719
we have this one this is different first

230
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,909
things first it is like untethered you

231
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,010
have no cables here you put your phone

232
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,680
in and you put that thing onto your head

233
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,079
and off you go

234
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,339
however there has a downside that this

235
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,959
thing does not know we're in the room I

236
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,420
am so it doesn't it can't tell this

237
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,540
is different than this position yes sure

238
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,700
it has gyroscopes and stuff but they're

239
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,860
not accurate and fast enough to actually

240
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,660
do this kind of tracking in a room scale

241
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,910
so it's gonna get like imprecise and

242
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,530
when something doesn't add up in your

243
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,030
brain then you're gonna vomit which is

244
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,010
not a nice experience so this one the

245
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,210
only thing you can do is you can look

246
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,100
around the space there you're standing

247
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,760
or sitting but it comes as a lower price

248
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,040
it's around $100 maybe even less these

249
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,280
days but you also have to have a samsung

250
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,750
phone that is compatible with it this is

251
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,970
the gear VR from Samsung there's other

252
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,740
headsets as well I'm just picking a few

253
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,970
of them that's like daydream there's a

254
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,980
oculus rift all these exists somewhere

255
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,340
on the spectrum then we have this any

256
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,060
guesses on the price five Google

257
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,860
cardboard is around five dollars it's

258
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,420
like if you'd ship it from China it's

259
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,180
probably like two dollars really but it

260
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,560
also has the downside you don't have

261
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,360
like any buttons any controllers

262
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,980
anything and you only have the

263
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,510
orientation so you can only look around

264
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,850
but it works with most phones not all

265
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,070
phones if you have a potato phone os

266
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,610
then that's gonna be a bad time if you

267
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,730
have a Windows Phone moving on so the

268
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,220
mark kids in 2016 I still haven't seen

269
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,810
numbers for last year so I'm waiting for

270
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,920
the numbers for last year I was

271
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,390
basically like frantically checking

272
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,150
Google like are the numbers out for 2017

273
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,520
they're not okay fine I'm gonna go with

274
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,640
the numbers for the previous year 2016

275
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,410
so here we see how many of these devices

276
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,230
have been sold and you see like oculus

277
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,650
rift is around like 450,000 HTC vive

278
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,120
around like 489 500 thousand devices

279
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,710
PlayStation VR a little over 600

280
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,560
thousand devices daydream that just came

281
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,850
out this year so it's a little bit like

282
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,350
comparing apples to oranges because

283
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,840
daydream basically came out in q3 of

284
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,180
that year so they'd only got like two

285
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,830
quarters instead of the full four

286
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,270
quarters so it sounds like a few hundred

287
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,820
thousand devices and give er that has

288
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,380
been around the longest probably

289
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,350
together with oculus rift has been

290
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,720
around like a couple of million 2.2

291
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,990
million devices sold and so you can you

292
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,420
can draw conclusions from this so if you

293
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,430
think about it this is like the high-end

294
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,680
VR experience you have to have a gamer

295
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,339
PC

296
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:08,980
like really strong graphics engine in

297
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,410
there you have to set up the room for it

298
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,180
and you have to like buy this hardware

299
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,800
that is I think the rift is now like

300
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,769
$300 or $400 or something like that the

301
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:20,139
HTC survive still a little more like 700

302
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:23,829
600 $700 and these require a bunch of

303
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,540
effort and you really have to really

304
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,670
really want it because you have to like

305
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,100
buy hardware for it and then we have the

306
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,339
the mobile VR here and you can tell

307
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:34,629
about the gear VR that Mobile is

308
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,519
probably the thing that people are ok

309
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,800
with and like around 100 bucks is what

310
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,189
they are ok with spending for and then

311
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:43,480
surprisingly game consoles I just have

312
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,730
that in for the you know for the fun

313
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,290
conclusion that gaming consoles

314
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,490
apparently are also something that

315
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,620
people want to invest in for new gear

316
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,550
and for so this looks like give yards by

317
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,680
far the most popular player and the

318
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,149
market has been the most popular player

319
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,459
in the market in 2016 can you tell me

320
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:06,160
which one is missing here a cardboard so

321
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,499
why did I forget that well I didn't

322
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:14,410
forget it it's just it's changing the

323
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,399
graph a little so we had and that's like

324
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,689
estimated numbers like that's a

325
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:22,029
conservative estimation because a lot of

326
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:23,709
devices that are not technically

327
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,899
cardboard are actually cardboards like

328
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:27,850
you can get like plastic versions of a

329
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,679
cardboard which is not really counting

330
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,480
towards this number but we get like 82

331
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,889
I'm sorry what what is the number right

332
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,899
it's - my name is eros I keep getting

333
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,610
confused yes it's like 80 something

334
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,199
million devices out there so you could

335
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:45,730
say yeah

336
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,629
the high end is where I go for this is

337
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:51,069
what I should build for because you can

338
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:53,470
build amazing experiences but then your

339
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,420
users are less likely to have them so

340
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,209
what we have to keep in mind is we are

341
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:03,279
at a stage and this is probably still

342
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,649
true today with its changing but we're

343
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:08,679
still not there yet that the market is

344
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,100
mostly low-end we are explorers which is

345
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,660
cool because we actually haven't figured

346
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,519
out how to do we are like what we can

347
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,350
all do with we are in total like we

348
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,060
haven't even under

349
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,030
stood what the medium can deliver so far

350
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,430
and the same goes for ARS was basically

351
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,500
XR is unexplored territory so we need

352
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,090
some time to basically build stuff and

353
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,010
try things out and we can do that

354
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,380
because users are willing to is to spend

355
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,110
a little money to try it out with us but

356
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,160
we have to understand that the

357
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,960
capabilities are the minimum

358
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,060
capabilities we're not having like two

359
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,680
controllers and room-scale tracking

360
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,020
where can I go oh my god no we are at

361
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,390
the very very beginning so bear in mind

362
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,680
that most people are actually running

363
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,350
card boards these days still and I think

364
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,540
the web is the best platform to start

365
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,060
exploring for the simple reason that the

366
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,850
web as web developers we have learned to

367
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,280
not expect much from the devices we are

368
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,830
on we don't know where our browsers

369
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,200
running could be a fridge it could be a

370
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,420
watch it could be a potato who knows

371
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,210
right if it has a browser it can run the

372
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,150
web so unlike native developers who are

373
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,680
like no no no no no I know the screen

374
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,810
sizes like this and I remember the day

375
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,130
when the two different screen size

376
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,740
iPhones came out and the iOS Department

377
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,090
in a company that I worked for at the

378
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,670
time just went bananas like two screen

379
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,550
sizes who can deal with that right we're

380
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,870
gonna need the next two months to

381
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,520
actually factor all our application

382
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,950
layouts and I'm like how's the web team

383
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,360
doing we're like what oh we're done

384
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,850
solved so the same goes for VR because

385
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,320
we don't know what kind of device we're

386
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,670
having and even if we would know what

387
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,050
kind of device we're having there's a

388
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,430
lot of assumptions we can't make the

389
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,770
controller's from the wife you have two

390
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,480
controllers so I can totally do like oh

391
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,820
yeah the you start the game by dragging

392
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,400
something open with two controllers

393
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,840
that's cool but the controls are

394
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
wireless so they have to charge every

395
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,090
now and then so imagine the experience

396
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,680
of a user having one thing in the

397
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,510
charger base somewhere and then going

398
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,430
like I'm gonna play this game start the

399
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,640
game by dragging with two hands it's not

400
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,950
working right it's not a good experience

401
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,260
so basically we know how to deal with

402
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,200
responsive capabilities we have to deal

403
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,150
with what we can build and then

404
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,710
basically enhance until we reach the

405
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,120
level of the capabilities of the

406
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,770
hardware that we're running on and I

407
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,270
think the web is perfect for that and

408
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,880
everything that has a browser is able to

409
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,800
basically display content so we can

410
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,420
figure out a way to actually make all

411
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,800
our content respond

412
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,770
so for instance if you're coming to my

413
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,080
page with a Netscape Navigator I might

414
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,630
show you an image of a building instead

415
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,300
like a 3d image JPEG image your Netscape

416
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,040
Navigator can probably deal with that

417
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,530
cool and then if you're coming with a

418
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,000
more modern browser on a desktop without

419
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
any VR hardware or on a phone you get a

420
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,430
you get a 3d thing that you can like use

421
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,530
the mouse and keyboard or touchscreen to

422
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,240
navigate around and then you have a

423
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,740
button that you press and then you go

424
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,900
into VR and actually experience it as if

425
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,030
you were there that's pretty cool and

426
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,380
the web is basically the perfect

427
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,810
platform because it fits the paradigm so

428
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,290
well also the other thing is if I build

429
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,890
something for let's say vive or oculus

430
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,360
and then I build something and I is

431
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,040
let's say we have like a paint

432
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,020
application we can like paint something

433
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,670
and it's like I want to show this to you

434
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,170
and then maybe you want to add something

435
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,980
to it but then you have a cardboard

436
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,420
that's sad right so the only way to

437
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,460
actually collaborate or share would then

438
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,720
be to take my wonderful

439
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,730
three-dimensional scene and take a

440
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,290
picture of that and send you a picture

441
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,350
what's the point of that right so I

442
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,030
think the web is flexible enough to do

443
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,890
that but the question is can we even

444
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,140
like do 3d graphics on the web and the

445
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,930
answer is yes yes like WebGL has been

446
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,910
around since 2011 so most browsers are

447
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,560
supported opera doesn't support it

448
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,050
because it is usually relatively sorry

449
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,280
Opera Mini doesn't support it because

450
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,130
the VR sorry the 3d content is usually

451
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,650
pretty heavy on data and they don't want

452
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,210
that kind of data so they're not

453
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,100
supporting it so that you have to then

454
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,600
deal like okay right I'll give you the

455
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,910
image version here you go and that's

456
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,320
perfectly fine that's a reasonable

457
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,440
assumption so eighty six point five

458
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,210
percent of the global browser users

459
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,980
actually are capable of displaying 3d

460
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,780
graphics interactive 2d graphics in the

461
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,270
browser with no plugins required that's

462
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,950
pretty cool

463
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,960
but for vpr we need something else so

464
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,960
basically we do need actually WebGL to

465
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,470
render things to display 3d content but

466
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,310
VR or XR AR whatever needs something

467
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,960
else on top of that because we need

468
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,760
access to the devices we need access to

469
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,260
other information like the sensor

470
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,330
information the controllers we need all

471
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,700
that and that's exactly what the web XR

472
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,010
API and the web via our API before that

473
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,830
our

474
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,690
about so it gives us information is

475
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,789
there a headset available on the phone

476
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:50,679
it usually says yes because you have

477
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:52,720
cardboards so we can't really detect

478
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,010
that because you just put your phone

479
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,500
into a piece of cardboard but basically

480
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,090
the assumption is yes you have a headset

481
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,570
you could go into VR if you wanted it

482
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,669
also checks if we have information of

483
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:05,380
where in the room you are which you do

484
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,640
have on higher-end

485
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,090
devices or at least where you're looking

486
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,000
at at the moment the orientation of the

487
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,360
users field of view and it exposes the

488
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,980
controller so we can actually work with

489
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,100
this so don't confuse the vet VR or the

490
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,620
web xrap eyes as something that renders

491
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,649
2d graphics it does not it's the only

492
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:28,179
thing that it does is it gives us access

493
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:30,100
to the headsets and send like image data

494
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,260
there it gives us your orientation and

495
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,260
position of the user if available and it

496
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,200
exposes any possible controllers using

497
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,419
the gamepad API so that's pretty much it

498
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,269
it does not create 3d graphics we have

499
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,100
to do something else to get 3d graphics

500
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,529
and that was what WebGL is for I see

501
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,360
that often confused it is two different

502
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,399
things and this is also why it's so

503
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:53,019
responsive because we can start with a

504
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:55,000
3d experience so yesterday I had a

505
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,669
workshop on on VR at the center's our

506
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:05,529
shangri-la thing hotel and I was telling

507
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:07,960
like yes this is all VR already but

508
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,130
we're not going to test it because it's

509
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,899
just like putting up more time we would

510
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,730
need more time to like put it on the

511
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,230
headset and see if it looks good and

512
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,870
then go back to the computer and refresh

513
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,570
but because it is basically just sending

514
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,130
more information to us so that we can

515
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,649
actually change our our camera and stuff

516
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:26,409
like that we can just start with the 3d

517
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:28,870
experience and then enhance VR or a are

518
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,539
on top of it which is exactly what we

519
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,700
want because we can't expect that any or

520
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,860
like all of our users want to be in VR

521
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,419
all the time we don't know that now the

522
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,580
VIP VR API currently exists in version

523
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,519
1.1 2.0 coming out soon it's gonna be

524
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,600
renamed it's gonna be called the web XR

525
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,210
API the immersive devices API or

526
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,889
something like that so it's going to be

527
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:56,289
renamed because in version 2.0 we are

528
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:58,730
also addressing other mixed reality

529
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,130
concerns so we're also having a are in

530
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,310
there so we're moving from VR to broader

531
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,160
API that also supports a are in one set

532
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,990
of API so that you don't have to worry

533
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,460
about this which is nice but the AVR 1.1

534
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,550
VR 1.1 implementation is a little

535
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,610
lacking so far but what's cool is a few

536
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,810
browsers shipped it in production

537
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,260
already you have Firefox since version

538
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,200
55 shipping it Chrome for Android is

539
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,390
shipping it since Chrome for Android 59

540
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,360
it there are builds for chromium that

541
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,220
actually supported but in April we're

542
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,140
gonna ship or we're gonna problem

543
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,170
hopefully see web X our API is shipping

544
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,570
and Chrome regular on desktops as well

545
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:47,770
and holy moly

546
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,060
Edge's shipping them what right so yeah

547
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,560
I think that's like that's pretty cool

548
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,400
actually and not only them so like we

549
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,490
have seen edge we have Samsung internet

550
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,900
ships them as well

551
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,610
we have Carmel which is an experimental

552
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,520
browser from Facebook for oculus

553
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,350
definitely there's a chrome version

554
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,360
there's chromium chromium version

555
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,850
there's Chrome for Android shipping it

556
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,290
Firefox nightly has had it for ages

557
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,930
already and then there's the out one out

558
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,390
there servo server has support for web

559
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,550
excel as well and it's like super cool

560
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,020
because they are proposing in addition

561
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,390
to WebGL that makes it even faster and

562
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,010
better and nicer so that's pretty

563
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,110
exciting so we have it available on many

564
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,090
many many devices already and it's only

565
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,100
going to be more devices having this

566
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,850
support soon it's an open standard it's

567
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,540
not one company doing it all vendors I

568
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,580
hear that someone has joined the working

569
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,620
group from Safari so safaris team is

570
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,180
also on the working group they're not

571
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,400
signaling much yet but they are on the

572
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,960
working group which is a good sign I

573
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,640
would say but it's an open standard

574
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,350
where all the vendors are working

575
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,150
together to bring us in the set of api's

576
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,400
and they work together with oculus and

577
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,320
HTC and Samsung and all the other

578
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,180
companies that make headsets for us as

579
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,160
well so that's pretty exciting daydream

580
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,930
supports it as well so that's like

581
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,000
really nice and there's so much tooling

582
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,530
and a really strong community going on

583
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,210
like whenever you are having a question

584
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,500
you pop into a slack that is

585
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,380
like dedicated to epics are or one of

586
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,750
the libraries and everyone's like super

587
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,280
keen to help you there's like lots of

588
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,810
activity on Stack Overflow for all these

589
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,300
things lots of tutorials available so

590
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,610
you can get started relatively quickly

591
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,520
and it is just easier to create and

592
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,250
share a co-worker of mine has tried to

593
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,440
do it with unity and if this unity is a

594
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,300
perfectly fine tool unity is an amazing

595
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,360
tool for when you want to do what unity

596
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,700
does so if you're a game developer unity

597
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,110
is a great way to like quickly build a

598
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,400
game that is cross-platform that's

599
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,130
amazing it also exports to WebGL also

600
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,860
amazing however the developer cycle is

601
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,900
different because you code you compile

602
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,180
you take your head you run you take your

603
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,920
headset you pull it on you'll be like ah

604
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,080
damn I made a stupid mistake here you

605
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,060
put it down you go back to your computer

606
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,450
you like rewrite you recompile you rerun

607
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,430
you you know it takes a little while to

608
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,470
get that going the cycle is quite slow

609
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,560
actually so basically with the web you

610
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,770
just like write the code try it out oh

611
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,220


612
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,530
fix it reload or still not good and

613
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,640
then you basically iterate really

614
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,800
quickly over that this is how you get

615
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,590
started no just kidding this is the

616
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,970
current another concern like everyone's

617
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,140
like super concerned that it's super

618
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,910
hard to get started that's not true

619
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,950
anymore so let's quickly try this I

620
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,330
tried this for like one minute and then

621
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,520
we're gonna have to have to move on

622
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,490
unfortunately so here I have a very very

623
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,470
boring website and I have the code for

624
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,000
this very very boring website but I love

625
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,190
to libraries I load Mozilla's a frame

626
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,620
and I load our libraries shameless plug

627
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,470
the 3d i/o library and I have something

628
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,360
here that looks suspicious right I have

629
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,120
something here called the a scene so

630
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,830
what can I do it will have an a scene

631
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,300
what I can do is I can create entities

632
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,860
basically this is like a stage this is

633
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,380
an empty stage and I can put something

634
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,850
on this stage I can say I want the

635
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,960
geometry to be a box and I want a

636
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,590
material that has a color red and now I

637
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,240
want to move this around on the stage so

638
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,190
maybe I say like and all of these

639
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,560
numbers are meters because that's the

640
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,990
metric system is a sensible system so I

641
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,160
don't want to move it to the left or to

642
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,450
the right I don't want to move it up or

643
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,130
down but I want to move it two meters

644
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,620
into the screen and now if i refresh

645
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,770
tada

646
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,390
there's a red box now

647
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,370
is not an exciting demo but I have a VR

648
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,470
button here so I can go into VR if I

649
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,300
would have a VR headset what was really

650
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,130
cool is a frame has a bunch of developer

651
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,530
tools so we get a full-blown 3d editor

652
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,750
as developer tools in here and that

653
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,060
allows me to like move The Box around so

654
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,310
I can move it here and there and then I

655
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,170
go back and hey look at that the box has

656
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,170
moved I can also change things about

657
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,640
this box so I don't want the box

658
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,380
I want a eye one day I don't know Taurus

659
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,050
not boom here we go we have a Taurus not

660
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,580
cool I don't know why you would want

661
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,640
that but go ahead I don't judge I don't

662
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,560
like the color so hey how about we make

663
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,780
this like blueish and I don't like that

664
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,760
it's not very metally and shiny I want

665
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,120
this to be shinier so I would go and

666
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,100
where's the metalness parameter here it

667
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,600
is here we go like we make this like

668
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,090
super shiny hey we have a shiny thing

669
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,370
now and you can basically build your

670
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,990
application like this you can explore

671
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,060
and what I can also do is I can go like

672
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,700
hey 3d IO people who did something for

673
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,730
me here so I can drag-and-drop something

674
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,890
that they build and just use it in my

675
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,930
application and if the Wi-Fi holds up

676
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,400
yes here we are

677
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,560
we can go back in and hey look at that

678
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,120
there's a weird tourist not in an

679
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,540
apartment that you might know we can

680
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,980
stand in Sheldon's spot just to you know

681
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,680
anger him so it's really easy to get

682
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,510
building really really quickly and you

683
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,160
don't have like I don't have to know any

684
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,190
math here I basically just just add HTML

685
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,130
tags and that's more or less it so I can

686
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,830
say hey maybe I want to copy out what I

687
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,360
just build in here so I can go here now

688
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,650
that's the light that's not what I want

689
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,020
it I can go here and I can just go okay

690
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,300
I want to copy this into my code now and

691
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,020
then I paste this into my code and if i

692
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,610
refresh Hey look at that

693
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,570
tada right so this is a really really

694
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,400
nice and fast way to get going and

695
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,770
basically start building things with no

696
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,100
big deal and no big pain so this is

697
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,900
really nice to get started and actually

698
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,040
you can build really exciting

699
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,300
applications with it you can build

700
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,890
production-ready applications with a

701
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,190
frame and that's actually pretty expand

702
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,500
so as I said this is not just VR and 3d

703
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,100
this is all

704
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,200
also going to have a our capabilities

705
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,000
thanks to the API broadening up in

706
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,640
version two to be an X our API so that's

707
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,770
exciting and you can do things like this

708
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,850
oh no the video is noting again anyway

709
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,130
this is a VAR application we have oh

710
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,140
look at that so here we are in Zurich

711
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,049
and we're basically plotting out where

712
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:03,580
the walls of this wonderful room are and

713
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,620
turned it on turn this is an open source

714
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,330
demo you can basically clone that from

715
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,890
github if you ask me for the URL I'm

716
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:13,130
happy to share that later on and then we

717
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,100
say we're door is so here's a door tada

718
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,320
and then there's another door tada which

719
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,000
is like a super weird living room but ok

720
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,919
let's go for it you get a floor plan

721
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,450
based on that and then you can say I

722
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,580
want to furnish this and using our API

723
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,130
you get furniture and you see like this

724
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,590
is actual this is a our we are in a real

725
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,940
world context and we're adding

726
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,679
information to it and this is on the

727
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,570
phone and this is on the browser so this

728
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,789
demo is actually available you need an

729
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,350
experimental browser right now but

730
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,880
that's gonna change in the near future

731
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,299
so here we go they are settled that's

732
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:46,370
gonna be an interesting talk on that by

733
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,460
a 180 and later today there's more stuff

734
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,840

735
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,130
that gets you going with a frame really

736
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,990
quickly there's the up crater 3d dot IO

737
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,789
that's our thing that gets you like a

738
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:58,700
playground environment I actually do

739
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,320
videos together with my co-workers that

740
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,210
explain you all the important things or

741
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,159
the steps that you need to do we have a

742
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,140
bit of a blog shameless plug

also exchange ideas and stuff and I want

750
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,470
you to build stuff with this if this is

751
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,870
the one takeaway that you take away make

752
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,960
it the following if compute if the

753
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,940
computer is the bicycle for our mind

754
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,549
which accelerates our natural abilities

756
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,190
you anywhere and now is the time to

757
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,620
