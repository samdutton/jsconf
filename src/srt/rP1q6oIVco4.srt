1
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,750
Thank you so much.

2
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,199
So, as has been said, my name is Raquel VÃ©lez.

3
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,570
I am @Rockbot on all of the things.

4
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,220
I am a senior software developer at Npm, Inc.

5
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,530
You may have heard of npm, you use it to install
all of your wonderful JavaScript things.

6
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,640
I am honored to be able to work there.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,710
If I can answer any questions or give you
stickers, please let me know.

8
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,170
I have answers... and stickers.

9
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,660
So, let's get started.

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:02,250
On a scale of "fist" to "high-five", where
would you rate yourself as a developer?

11
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,920
Where a fist is, "I'm just figuring out this
whole JavaScript thing.

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,080
I think I know what a variable is and I'm
learning about loops, etc."

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,780
To "I have taught Brandon Eich everything
he knows."

14
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,340
And you can totally do the Fitbit thing if
you want.

15
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,970
You can be like, "I'm a three-and-a-half"
or whatever.

16
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,030
Cool.

17
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,149
All right.

18
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:27,350
You can play along too!

19
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,490
Feel free to play along.

20
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,490
Cool.

21
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,840
I'm seeing kind of like beginning to middle...

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
That's awesome.

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Great.

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,759
What I'd like to talk today about is how we
go from here (fist) to here (high-five).

25
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,310
Because I think a lot of us who are kind here
(fist with wiggling thumb), don't know what

26
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,560
this path looks like (opens to high-five).

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,060
And I think those of us who are here (high-five)
forgot what it was like to be here (fist).

28
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,560
So let's go through that whole process.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Yeah, it's intense.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,720
I am going to use my personal story.

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,780
This is not going to match everybody's, but
I think a lot of the elements are going to

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,619
be the same.

33
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,550
It all starts out the same for all of us.

34
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,880
For whatever reason we say, "I'm going to
start learning JavaScript."

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,580
Or insert technology of your choice, but I'm
going to start with JavaScript.

36
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,030
Whether it's for a business reason or for
personal reasons, we say "Okay.

37
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,030
This JavaScript thing?

38
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,150
I'm going to do it.

39
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,010
Let's do this.

40
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,010
Yes!

41
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,010
Totally!"

42
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,030
For me, I used to be a roboticist.

43
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,819
I used to build robots.

44
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,780
And I said to myself, "OK, this is kind of
boring, because the robots... they don't really

45
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,780
have fun with me.

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,810
We don't get to party.

47
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,099
We don't get to talk about boys.

48
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,110
We don't...

49
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,720
They're just kind of robots."

50
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,440
And so I decided I needed a little more people
in my life.

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,341
I was living in Charlotte, North Carolina
at the time and I said "OK, where is a cool

52
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:02,680
place to work?

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,560
I think the Internet is kinda cool.

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,319
Let's do that."

55
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,150
I mean, I was a roboticist.

56
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,680
The Internet can't be that hard.

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,260
I went and talked to the CEO of the coolest
company in town.

58
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,750
I said, "I'd really like to work at your company.

59
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,599
What do I need to do to work here?"

60
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,739
He said, "Learn Node."

61
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:24,739
Okay.

62
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,739
Cool.

63
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,000
So I went home and said, "I am going to learn
Node.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,909
Let's do this.

65
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,549
I'm going to build an application.

66
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,129
That's how I learn."

67
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,500
And I got nowhere.

68
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,719
This happens to all of us.

69
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,689
We have no idea what we're doing, because
we don't know the words that we need.

70
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:47,220
I knew enough to say, "OK, Node.

71
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,099
It's a project, it's a thing.

72
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,939
Go to the website: nodejs.org."

73
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:55,519
I downloaded Node.

74
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,400
I knew enough about the command-line to say,
"There's no 'application', so I don't double-click

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
on anything."

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,200
I go to the command-line and type n-o-d-e
enter.

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,049
What happens at that point?

78
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,849
You get this caret-y thing.

79
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,180
Looks like this: >

80
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,610
You see it also in the JavaScript console,
when you go in a browser.

81
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,609
And you're looking at it, and it doesn't say
anything.

82
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:18,769
You're like "Okay..."

83
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,680
So, go! g-o enter.

84
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,130
And what does it say?

85
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,360
It says "undefined".

86
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,890
You're like, "Okay.

87
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,510
This doesn't work for me at all.

88
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,030
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do."

89
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,360
I don't have the words.

90
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,860
I don't have the vocabulary to use to say
"How do I make this thing work?"

91
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,370
So, what do you do next?

92
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,479
You go online.

93
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,560
Go to Google.

94
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Stack Overflow.

95
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,710
Blog posts.

96
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,710
Whatever.

97
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,520
And you start looking for help.

98
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:56,490
PRO TIP: "caret-y thing in Node" does not
produce any useful results.

99
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,110
There's just nothing in there.

100
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,840
Again... no vocabulary.

101
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,120
No way for me to say, "I have no idea what
I'm doing.

102
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,949
I need help."

103
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:12,240
And then on top of that, this was at the beginning
of 2012, when Node was super-new.

104
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,460
It had been around for a couple of years,
but it was still really brand-new.

105
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,110
To the point where any tutorials I found...
if it was more than 6 months old, it was completely

106
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,940
out-of-date.

107
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,220
This isn't even useful to me.

108
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,220
So, whatever.

109
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,220
I still try.

110
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,410
I find some things.

111
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,120
I start playing around and I say "This is
cool, but...

112
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,370
I...

113
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,690
Caret-y thing?

114
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,920
Help?"

115
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,310
So at that point I realized I needed more
people in my life.

116
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,580
I needed to start asking questions.

117
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,090
So I went to a local meetup.

118
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,419
That's a great way to start meeting people.

119
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,520
Local developers in your community, and you
can actually talk to them.

120
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,270
You can say, "So look, here is my terminal.

121
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,389
n-o-d-e enter.

122
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,389
Caret-y thing."

123
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:00,889
(shrug)

124
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:03,770
And they go, "Oh, that's the REPL!

125
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,759
Yes, that's the read-eval-print-loop.

126
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,729
That's how we do all of our on-demand type
stuff.

127
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,889
What you really want is, you want a separate
file.

128
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,569
And then you can run node file."

129
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:17,520
And then it runs, and magic, and you're like
"Oh my god, why did nobody tell me this?

130
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,300
I didn't understand anything."

131
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,979
But that's okay.

132
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,150
Because you go, and you talk to these people.

133
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,849
And they have been there enough that they
can read your mind a little bit.

134
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,430
And you're like "Caret-y thing!" and they're
like, "Yes, REPL.

135
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,449
That's the word."

136
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:36,010
And you're like, "Cool!"

137
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,000
At the same time I was trying to build this
app.

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,750
And I was like, "I have this app.

139
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,640
I want it to store data.

140
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,690
And I know I need a database, but I've only
used MySQL before."

141
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,240
Because that's what I used when I was hacking
on my Wordpress blog.

142
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,220
"Is that what I want to use?"

143
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,030
Whatever you want to say about databases...
blah, blah, blah.

144
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,039
At the time, what I needed was MongoDB.

145
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,620
It was the perfect solution.

146
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,009
Again, talking to people in person.

147
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,629
Being able to use words that didn't make any
sense to Google, but made sense to people,

148
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:10,150
made a huge difference.

149
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,400
Empowered with all this incredible knowledge,
I went back to my app.

150
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,410
OK, I'm building this app.

151
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,139
I've got Mongoose, and I've got Express.

152
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,280
And how do I integrate these things?

153
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
I don't know.

154
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,280
But now I have keywords that I can ask Google.

155
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,960
You type: Mongo Node.

156
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,770
There is this wonderful module called Mongoose.

157
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,350
They have a website, and they have code samples.

158
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,350
You're like "Yes!

159
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,350
Perfect!

160
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,350
Code samples!"

161
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,449
Copy, paste.

162
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:40,220
I expect magic to happen.

163
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,930
And no magic happens.

164
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,050
And, you're like, "Why isn't this working?

165
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,020
I don't know."

166
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,330
You don't have the concepts fully-integrated
into understanding how this is all supposed

167
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,330
to come together.

168
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,419
So you go back!

169
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:01,680
And maybe your local meetup only meets once
a month, so you need to expand your group

170
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,670
of people to ask questions.

171
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,139
What did I do?

172
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:06,349
I went on to IRC.

173
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,180
If you don't know what IRC is, it's this amazing
technology that's been around apparently forever,

174
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,910
but I didn't hear about it until 2012.

175
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:18,349
And it was on IRC that I found the mongoose.js
channel.

176
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:20,419
And I was like "Hi!

177
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:22,289
I'm using your thing.

178
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,650
I think it's the right thing for me, but it's
not working in my stuff."

179
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,220
They're like, "Send us your code."

180
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:34,000
And I did what every single new person does:
I copied and pasted all of my code into IRC.

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,370
It was like, 25 lines of stuff.

182
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,830
Someone said, "Oh, god, please don't do that
again."

183
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,530
And then I learned about a thing called Pastebin.

184
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,530
That was super-useful.

185
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,540
Then of course, gists, etc.

186
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,010
But I did the thing that everybody does, and
I got very politely yelled at.

187
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,060
"Don't do that again."

188
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,060
"Okay."

189
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,980
But still, being able to share my code with
someone else from a larger community.

190
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,190
People who were from all over the world, not
just my local community!

191
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,380
Because when you're hacking at 2 am, sometimes
your friends are not awake, but somebody in

192
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,880
Germany might be!

193
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,320
And that's awesome because they can give you
this feedback, and they share more appropriate

194
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,790
vocabulary with you, and then you understand
the concepts: you understand how things link

195
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,790
together.

196
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,390
And it's really awesome!

197
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,490
So you take all this knowledge.

198
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,450
And you're still going to mess up.

199
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,160
If you're not messing-up, you're not doing
engineering.

200
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,410
Just FYI.

201
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,589
This is how it works.

202
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,320
You do good, you mess up, you succeed.

203
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,000
It's just this cycle and you just kind of
keep moving forward.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,850
But!

205
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,880
This is a turning point.

206
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,529
These concepts are coming together enough,
and you have grown your community enough to

207
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,390
the point where you're like "OK, whenever
I have a problem, I might not know what it

208
00:09:53,390 --> 00:10:00,390
is, and I might not know how to fix it, but
I at least know what to ask, where to ask,

209
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,480
and who to ask."

210
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Right?

211
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,680
Go on IRC, go to your friends, go to your
meetup.

212
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
Whatever.

213
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,840
Know exactly the magical keywords to get the
thing out of Google or Stack Overflow.

214
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Fantastic.

215
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,010
So now you can keep moving forward.

216
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,820
And you're like, "Yes!

217
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,260
I got this!"

218
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,350
You find this point at which you are like,
"Wow, this is actually really cool!

219
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,860
This is so fun!

220
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,130
I love this!"

221
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,570
But I'm doing this on the side.

222
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,570
I have another job, and it is sucking all
the life out of me because I really just want

223
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,490
to play with Node all the time.

224
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,269
"Maybe I can get a job in Node!

225
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,269
Yes!

226
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,690
That's totally a perfect idea."

227
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:46,180
At some point you get to where you know enough
information that you can be a junior developer.

228
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,040
Junior developers are useful.

229
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,290
They're useful because you can tell them exactly
what to do and you don't have to pay them

230
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,300
very much money and you can still move forward
with your product.

231
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,800
So you bring a junior developer on-board.

232
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,950
Yeah, you have to train them a little bit,
but you get to train them doing exactly what

233
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,200
you want them to do.

234
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,730
So from a junior developer perspective, you're
like "Oh my goodness!

235
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,490
Now I have this opportunity to get paid while
I learn.

236
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,490
Awesome."

237
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,940
For me, I got a job as intern.

238
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,280
I wasn't even a junior developer yet: I just
got enough to be an intern.

239
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,180
I was getting paid 500 dollars a week, which
is not very much at all.

240
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,570
Especially for someone who is coming from
robotics, it was kind of a blow to the ego,

241
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,800
but I was like, "You know what?

242
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
It's worth it.

243
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
This is gonna be OK.

244
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,910
I'm gonna to make it work."

245
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,110
Fantastic.

246
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,209
You start working, and you start learning.

247
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:41,110
And then you get to this point where you are
like, "This is super fun, but I'm not exactly

248
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,209
learning all the things that I want to learn.

249
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm learning the things that my employer's
telling me to learn.

250
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,791
And that's fine, because at least for me,
I was working at a consulting company, so

251
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,180
I got to see a little php, I got to see a
little bit of Node, I got to see a little

252
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,370
bit of front-end stuff.

253
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,570
I was convinced I was going to be a back-end
developer because I did robotics.

254
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,540
Then I was like, "Hey, CSS -- as annoying
it can be -- is actually really cool.

255
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,740
You get to see stuff.

256
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,170
And you get to move things.

257
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,961
Floats, and divs, and wow!"

258
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,910
And so at that point I kind of transitioned
to be more of a front-end person, but still

259
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,990
lovin' the Node.

260
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,209
I like to think at it as a buffet of learning.

261
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:21,990
You go in and you just get a little bit each
of these little things.

262
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,920
But I still felt like I was missing something.

263
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,750
"Yes, this is our stack at this company, but
I know that there's more.

264
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,200
I keep hearing these rumours of these single
page applications and all this other stuff.

265
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,060
Where do you go to learn that?"

266
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,910
Where do you go?

267
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,589
You come to one of these.

268
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,149
This is where you find out about all those
things that you knew you were missing out

269
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:47,089
on something, but you didn't know what it
was.

270
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:51,430
How many of you've learned something new that
you didn't realize even existed since being

271
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,690
here?

272
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,950
Yeah!

273
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,209
Exactly.

274
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,089
So, it's fantastic.

275
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:58,339
You get what you're missing.

276
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:02,389
It is like drinking from a firehose.

277
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:05,550
It's like trying to get a little sip of water
and whoosh!

278
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,660
Right in your face.

279
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,240
My goodness, gracious!

280
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,019
But it is totally worth it, because then you
get super-excited about all this stuff.

281
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,910
My first conference was NodeConf SummerCamp
2012.

282
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,209
I went to this conference hoping to learn
more about the event loop.

283
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:25,480
Apparently there's going to be a talk about
the event loop later: I'm totally going to

284
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
that.

285
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,339
But at this conference I didn't learn about
the event loop.

286
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:33,110
I learned about "node-core" and "domains"
and "error handling" and I was like "Whoa,

287
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,290
I just want to learn about the event loop,
please.

288
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,850
I'm new to this."

289
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:45,070
But there was another really important aspect
of going to a conference.

290
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,350
I learned about people.

291
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,510
I met people.

292
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,709
Met all of these incredible people that have
completely changed my life.

293
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:59,899
Every conference I go to, I meet new people
and it's incredible.

294
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:02,769
I become really good friends with these people.

295
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:06,640
As a side note, if there's nothing else you
get out of this entire conference.

296
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Nothing.

297
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
At all.

298
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,700
Because let's be real: you can watch these
videos at home later...

299
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,300
If there's nothing else you get out of this
conference, walk away with at least 5 Twitter

300
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,300
handles.

301
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,510
5 Twitter handles of people that you are going
to hang out with and talk to on Twitter.

302
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,790
If you don't like Twitter, use Facebook or
email.

303
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,050
I don't care.

304
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,720
Make sure you get to know somebody else.

305
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,070
Because these people, that are sitting in
this room with you?

306
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,399
They are going to help you get your next job.

307
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,360
They're going to help you when you have a
bad day and they'll send you funny cat gifs.

308
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,420
Like, super awesome.

309
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,550
These people are really going to change your
life.

310
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,600
Right here.

311
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,240
The ones that are sitting right next to you.

312
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,709
And those of you following along at home,
come to a conference and let this totally

313
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:49,709
tranform you.

314
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:50,709
OK.

315
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:51,709
Coming back.

316
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:52,810
You're talking to these people.

317
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,519
You're at this amazing conference.

318
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,130
"There is so much cool technology.

319
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,389
Oh my goodness!

320
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,089
I totally want to play with this!"

321
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,639
When do you do that?

322
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,540
What do you do with all that cool technology?

323
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,970
You start working on it on your own.

324
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,060
And yeah, it kind of stinks.

325
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,610
You don't always get to take all the cool
technology back to work with you.

326
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,320
But let me just tell you a little bit: this
is a really good opportunity.

327
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,590
If you find the time to hack on things on
your own, you expose yourself to a whole bunch

328
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,889
of other stuff.

329
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:30,300
You get to use all of these people you met
at this conference, where you learned about

330
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
all this stuff.

331
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,680
And you can ask them, "Hey, can you take a
look at my code?"

332
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,259
Here is the thing about open source.

333
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:41,850
It is not about contributing to jQuery or
node-core.

334
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,339
It's about taking literally your source and
you're opening it up.

335
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:47,959
Just sharing your stuff on Github.

336
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:52,339
It doesn't need to be anything like, "Whoa,
magical!" or life-changing.

337
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:53,660
It just needs to be some code.

338
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,759
Show it to somebody.

339
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,579
Let someone else say, "Hey, why did you do
that?

340
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:01,959
What was your inspiration for this?

341
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,150
How did you figure that out?

342
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,589
That was really cool!"

343
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,509
Getting feedback on your code from somebody
else is super-useful.

344
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:15,550
For me, I was at this conference and talking
to somebody.

345
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,029
They said to me, "Hey, you used to do robotics.

346
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:21,459
You know what we're missing in node: we don't
have a matrix module."

347
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,389
I said, "You know, that's true.

348
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,149
There isn't a matrix module."

349
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:29,410
And I used to do robotics, so matrices and
I?

350
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,709
We're like this.

351
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:34,259
So I went ahead and started hacking on stuff.

352
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,410
So, you start hacking on things.

353
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,240
Look: you are still going to keep messing
up.

354
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,490
And failing.

355
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,490
And then you're going to succeed.

356
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,950
And there will be moments where you are like
"Oh my god!" and you're going to run around

357
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,690
the office or your bedroom, or whatever.

358
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,980
Because it's so exciting that you're getting
it.

359
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,569
But the point is that you're playing with
these things.

360
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:59,269
You're kind of already getting to know the
concepts and you're figuring all these things

361
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,269
out.

362
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,010
And it just starts to feel really good because
you're building confidence in yourself.

363
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,910
And you're like, "Actually...

364
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,329
I'm not a total newb anymore.

365
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,329
This is awesome!"

366
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,720
I mean, you didn't teach Brandon Eich everything
he knows.

367
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,890
But you're starting to get somewhere and you
feel really good about it.

368
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,810
These concepts are gelling really well, and
you start to experiment a little bit.

369
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,420
What happens when people get a little too
confident?

370
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,410
They start to get a little experimental.

371
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:33,110
"Hey, I wonder what happens if I do this thing?"

372
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,450
It's kinda scary.

373
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,730
And it's not always going to work.

374
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,790
But every once in a while it will.

375
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,670
Also at NodeConf I met this guy named Chris
Williams.

376
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,150
You may have heard of him.

377
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,600
He kind of started the whole JSConf thing.

378
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,600
But he's also into robots.

379
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,390
And I remember being at the conference and
talking to him.

380
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,810
And I was like, "Yeah, you know, robots are
kinda cool.

381
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,810
I guess.

382
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,810
Whatever."

383
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,100
And then he DM'd me later and he was like,
"OMG, wait.

384
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,950
You mean you used to do robotics full-time?

385
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,950
What are you doing right now?

386
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,320
Why are you in this whole web thing?

387
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,060
We need to be working together!

388
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,030
I do this thing called Nodebots.

389
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,580
It's not really a thing yet, but I want it
to be.

390
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,910
I need your help!"

391
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,240
So I said, "Okay.

392
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,310
That sounds kind of crazy.

393
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,310
Maybe I can..."

394
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,000
And afterwards as I'm building this matrix
module, I was like "Wait, maybe this is an

395
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,500
opportunity for me to kind of segue into that.

396
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,780
That's kind of cool."

397
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,440
These concepts are so solid.

398
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,900
And I have all this extra background information
from what I used to do.

399
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,320
Things that excite me in general.

400
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,660
And you keep experimenting and you keep playing
around.

401
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,830
Eventually something starts to stick.

402
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,510
Something starts to stick real well.

403
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,490
And for me, this was my vector module.

404
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:03,620
Not very many people use it, but it is actually
really cool how basically it is a robotics-focused

405
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,620
matrix module.

406
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,140
It's specificaly for robots.

407
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,170
It's specifically for matrices.

408
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,120
But I started building some really cool robots
with it.

409
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,810
And as you are building these things, you're
like, "Hey, people are starting to notice

410
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,810
this stuff!"

411
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,070
They start to use your stuff.

412
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,630
Whatever it is you are building, at some point
it is going to be successful enough that people

413
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,500
are going to notice.

414
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,660
Because people are going to check it out.

415
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,130
You are sharing your code, right?

416
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,440
You're putting it all out in open source.

417
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,560
People are going to notice.

418
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:42,390
I never forget the day I got a tweet from
Rick Waldron, who I'd never met at that point.

419
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,840
If you don't know who Rick Waldron is, he
is on TC39.

420
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,620
He's on the board of jQuery.

421
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,390
He wrote Johnny Five, which is like a jQuery
for hardware.

422
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,810
This is a guy that I totally bowed down to.

423
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,440
I was like, "Oh my goodness.

424
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,780
You know JavaScript.

425
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:04,150
I don't know JavaScript, but you know JavaScript,
and you're saying that my code is really awesome?

426
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,320
This is wild.

427
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,650
How did that happen?

428
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,790
How did I get here?"

429
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:14,770
And you completely forget all of the hard
work you went through trying to get there.

430
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:20,790
But from that point, you start to realize
that as you're writing about your stuff -- you

431
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:25,940
write blog posts, you go to workshops, you
lead workshops -- this stuff that you didn't

432
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:33,060
ever think was evenly remotely possible...
you're standing up and sharing your knowledge.

433
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,540
And people are starting to think like you're
an expert.

434
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,580
They start asking you for help.

435
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,231
You're the one they're waiting for on IRC.

436
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:42,231
"Hey!

437
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:43,231
There you are!

438
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:44,231
Hey, I have all these questions!

439
00:20:44,231 --> 00:20:46,190
Oh my god, can you please help me?

440
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,630
Here's all of my code!"

441
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,830
"Hold on!

442
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,530
Use a gist, please..."

443
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,870
People start to notice your expertise.

444
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,090
And that's really exciting.

445
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,580
For me, I started doing Nodebots, and Nodebots
completely took off.

446
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,170
We had a workshop at JSConf.

447
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,050
We had another workshop at the next JSConf.

448
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,150
We had International Nodebots day... twice!

449
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,670
There are all these incredible events, and
more stuff is coming.

450
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,370
But I want to hit home on this one thing.

451
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:23,340
As you start to build expertise, as people
start to notice all of the things you are

452
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,810
contributing, other people outside of your
necessary little niche are starting to start

453
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,470
noticing too.

454
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,590
Because as you become more of an expert, as
you start to actually know what you are doing,

455
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,590
other people are going to want to start bringing
you on board.

456
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,730
I stopped interviewing at this point.

457
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,790
I don't really send my resume out anymore.

458
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,010
I get other people calling me.

459
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,920
And I don't want to sound like, "Oh, look
at me: I'm so awesome!"

460
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
No.

461
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,800
What I'm saying is: other people are noticing
that you -- yes, you -- are really quite good

462
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,560
at what you're doing.

463
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,790
Believe it or not.

464
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,500
And they start calling you up and saying,
"Hey!"

465
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,910
Maybe they're Isaac Schlueter -- the BDFL
of Node: aka, the leader of the Node project

466
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,450
at the time -- saying, "Hi!

467
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,150
I really like the things that you're doing.

468
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,940
I'm starting this new company called Npm,
Inc.

469
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,680
Do you want to come on board?"

470
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:27,690
And you have this moment where you're like,
"I'm a total newb...

471
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,870
Right?"

472
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,200
And no, you're not.

473
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,520
You're not a newb anymore.

474
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,980
You have gone from here (fist) and you're
slowly making your way up.

475
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
Very slowly.

476
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,440
But you're there.

477
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,130
You're sharing your stuff everywhere.

478
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,060
Everybody's already asking for help.

479
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,400
How is it so much harder of an idea for somebody
to say, "Please come on board.

480
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,780
I want to pay you to work for me and nobody
else."?

481
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:02,280
That's a pretty amazing opportunity.

482
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:08,660
There gets to be this point at which you realize
-- despite every single little piece of imposter

483
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:15,460
syndrome that sits in your head saying "You
have no right to be up here" -- you say that

484
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,340
you've got to be up here.

485
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,630
Because if you don't share, then who will?

486
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:26,100
And, you realize that you have received so
much from this community.

487
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,200
So very, very much.

488
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,790
They put up with your ridiculous IRC logs
and they put up with your silly questions

489
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,090
of "caret-y thing?"

490
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,640
You realize you are not alone, and you've
got to give back.

491
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,550
You have to give back.

492
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,770
Somebody needs to hear your story.

493
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:52,340
So, I want you to know, that no matter where
you are on this scale (fist to high-five)...

494
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
Seriously.

495
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,340
Anywhere you are.

496
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,020
And believe me, at some point you're going
to be like, "Oh yeah, I know everything there

497
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,040
is to know about Angular or Ember, or whatever"
and someone is going to throw a brand new

498
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,710
framework at you and you're going to start
at zero all over again.

499
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,500
And you're going to continually say "I have
no idea what I'm doing!"

500
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,650
I want you to remember this major thing.

501
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,920
We're in this together.

502
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,410
We are all in this together.

503
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,360
And wherever you are, we are with you.

504
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm with you.

505
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
You're with me.

506
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,160
We're in this together.

507
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,340
Sorry, you're stuck.

508
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:34,360
It's really important to remember that JavaScript
is so much more than syntax.
