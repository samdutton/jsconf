1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:10,119

ah

2
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:13,440
as Chris said I'm a co-founder of 280

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,270
north my two co-founders are also here

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,810
Ross and Tom is somewhere we are

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,460
primarily responsible for a framework

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,119
called cappuccino we just really started

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,939
latest version 0.8 point 1 I will talk

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,289
about that a little bit later in the

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,409
presentation but as Chris said I kind of

10
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:32,759
wanted to do something a little bit

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,970
differently and kind of talk about what

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,670
was this kind of passion / side project

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,670
for us for the past couple of months and

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,100
has now increasingly become more

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,370
important as we start preparing for kind

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,680
of cappuccino one point oh and that is

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,460
documentation so I think it goes without

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,780
saying that documentation is really

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,990
important and I think most documentation

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,880
of most open source projects kind of

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,470
sucks ours included and I kind of want

22
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,489
to start this with kind of the funny

23
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,710
story behind cappuccino documentation so

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,630
if you go today to keva chino

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,800
documentation this is kind of what it

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,440
looks like it's it's your generic open

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,390
source documentation which is you know

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,370
we figured out how to use the tool that

29
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,690
spits out the method names and that's

30
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,650
more or less it there are some places we

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,320
were able to have some good descriptions

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,840
generally it's not that great we lucked

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,510
out however because since cappuccino was

34
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,100
based on an existing framework you know

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,200
we were basically implementing aspect

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,150
that already exists kind of the open

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,770
secret in the cappuccino community is

38
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,240
that you should never go to our Docs and

39
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,070
instead just go to developer apple com

40
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,110
and if you want to find out about CP

41
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,909
view you just read about NS view and the

42
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,860
documentation applies a hundred percent

43
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,049
not only that but if those aren't good

44
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,030
enough you can just hit the canoe staff

45
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,920
documentation which is also pretty darn

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,840
good and again applies one hundred

47
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,670
percent and if that's not good enough

48
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,229
then you can hit like all the different

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,680
cocoa blogs and books and stuff and you

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,750
know we even today recommend a cup of

51
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,119
cocoa books to our users so it we kind

52
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,759
of lucked out in this regard but we're

53
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,560
trying to change that for one point oh

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,379
the way I look at it is that we got

55
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,260
eighty percent for free like most open

56
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,760
source projects you know day one have

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,120
zero documentation

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
we had like seventy to eighty percent

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,810
good documentation the problem is

60
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,909
achieving that last twenty percent is

61
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:27,459
impossible with this model of oh just

62
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,950
disco ask Apple how to do it obviously

63
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,420
we can't change their dogs we can't add

64
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,670
anything new so we'd really like to do

65
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,560
for cappuccino 1 point 0 is have truly

66
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,260
world-class documentation and that's

67
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,150
kind of a problem because documentation

68
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,799
is hard and I think it's particularly

69
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,430
hard for any new project especially open

70
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,980
source and the reason I'm talking about

71
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,329
this here today and the reason Kris

72
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,950
asked me to talk about this is that i

73
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,680
think our community is at a place where

74
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,930
we could really benefit a lot from kind

75
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,120
of a revolution and documentation you

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,590
know we're at a place right now where

77
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,480
we're trying to really sell JavaScript

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,370
to a lot of people being able to do a

79
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,569
lot more than it could before you know

80
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,220
we're even taking the step of saying you

81
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,120
know you should be able to write your

82
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,430
servers in JavaScript and to be able to

83
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,720
do that to be able to convince people

84
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,230
upon kind of an already sketchy idea

85
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,250
they need to be able to know how to use

86
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,989
this stuff and again the problem with

87
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,220
most open source projects is that

88
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,750
they're really cool they're really

89
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,870
advanced but the documentation is kind

90
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,599
of terrible on day one and with these

91
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,980
kind of programming problems that have

92
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,840
nothing to do with code I think there's

93
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,989
a tendency to kind of look at in two

94
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:36,430
different ways one of them is to think

95
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,980
it's a cultural problem and this is kind

96
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,359
of what the testing community has done

97
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:41,500
right they've said well testing was a

98
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,419
cultural problem we have the right tools

99
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,069
for testing what we need to do is to

100
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:47,470
build a culture of testing and it's

101
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,799
worked out pretty well an example I

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,569
guess the flip side to that is to say

103
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,639
take technological problem and I usually

104
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,699
tend to side with that I happen to think

105
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,290
that most problems have technical

106
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,599
reasons and technical solutions and a

107
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,280
good example of that is version control

108
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,470
right I think most people are using

109
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,480
version control incorrectly not because

110
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,650
we had the wrong culture but we had the

111
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,510
wrong tools you know when get came out I

112
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,879
think all of us started using version

113
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,769
control completely differently we all

114
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,220
became much better and much more like

115
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,479
tightly knit community thanks to that

116
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,370
and it was all thanks to just a tool

117
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,400
that actually did its job correctly and

118
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,570
when I'm proposing today is that I think

119
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,419
that we do documentation completely

120
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:30,729
wrong and that's objectively like oh I

121
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,390
don't like it

122
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,730
but like mathematically provably wrong

123
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,340
and I think the main cause of this is

124
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,720
documentation and comments that's my

125
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,310
thesis for you I'll trying to make it

126
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,230
clever and save it to the end but you

127
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,580
know when you make your slides a day

128
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,820
before that you can't afford to do that

129
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,190
so I think that this is the root cause

130
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,860
of bad documentation in the JavaScript

131
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,060
community in the open source community

132
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,260
in most communities in general and so

133
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,760
before i get into exactly why that is i

134
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,410
want to give you guys a glimpse of how

135
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,530
your users for using your products

136
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,610
interact with your documentation what

137
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,360
the problems are so this is obvious

138
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,950
right day one you have no documentation

139
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,020
I think that's okay I think you'll never

140
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,250
solve that problem day one you should

141
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,260
have no documentation the problem is

142
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,910
that day two three four five months

143
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,230
later you still have really poor

144
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,420
documentation and we get into this place

145
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,030
eventually if you're I think a good open

146
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,500
source project where you have either

147
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,690
incomplete or incorrect documentation in

148
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,730
seconds for a lot of reasons right open

149
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,560
source projects iterate very quickly so

150
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
it's hard to keep the documentation up

151
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,900
to date and also when the source changes

152
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,000
your documentation becomes incorrect

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,900
right you fix a bug and the

154
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,180
documentation no longer matches etc etc

155
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,640
so for a whole number of reasons it's

156
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,900
really hard to keep your documentation

157
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,300
up to date with whatever tool you're

158
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,060
selling to users and what this means is

159
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,770
that your users are the second your

160
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,790
documentation is good enough they're

161
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,500
going to start looking at blogs we're

162
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,460
going to start looking at other places

163
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,990
and eventually they'll end up here your

164
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,030
IRC room otherwise known as purgatory

165
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,880
this is the worst place on earth on the

166
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,020
internet like I hate this so you go into

167
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,550
the IRC room you're like oh I'm using

168
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,650
this new tool and I'm naive and I want

169
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,510
to know how it works and your general

170
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,490
response is why are you trying to do

171
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,490
that idiot like come on like just take

172
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,050
my word for it there's a reason I'm

173
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,280
trying to call these functions just tell

174
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,870
me how they work and then you have to go

175
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,370
through the slow grueling process of

176
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,200
they have the information you don't so

177
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,370
you have to be nice to them all they get

178
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,380
to be a dick to you and

179
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,930
it's terrible it's absolutely so like

180
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,670
this is a cultural problem this is not

181
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,710
going to know IRC tool in the world will

182
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,790
make people not be jerks IRC but um so

183
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,060
kind of a corollary or you know a side

184
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,860
goal of Socratic is to make sure your

185
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,170
normal users never end up on your IRC

186
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,500
room we try really hard to keep our IRC

187
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,720
room very civil in fact if 280 north

188
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,220
goes out of business if no one if

189
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,290
everyone stops using cappuccino I will

190
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,120
still say you know this company was a

191
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,920
success because we were pretty good in

192
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,160
our IRC room so again we try to keep

193
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,660
people out of here you know for your own

194
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,860
benefit we're trying to keep people out

195
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,460
of your eye or serum so the other

196
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,020
problem with documentation for your

197
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,490
users is that it's generally not rich

198
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,440
right it's generally just a bunch of

199
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,680
text when a lot of times a movie or a

200
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,400
picture would be a lot better for them

201
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,530
and both these problems see to this that

202
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,780
I kind of alluded to which is at the end

203
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,220
of the day your documentation ends up

204
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,750
all over the place right it's really

205
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,890
exciting when you have a new project

206
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,050
when people start blogging about it but

207
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,760
blog posts are the worst forms of

208
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,710
documentation because they never get

209
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,660
updated like you're a ton of projects

210
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,240
were like the way you theme is described

211
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,800
in a blog post that came out you know a

212
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,180
year ago and that's the number one hit

213
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,340
on Google and it's not the way you theme

214
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,960
anymore until you go and you tried and

215
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,000
it's wrong and then go into the IRC room

216
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,320
good doesn't work let me back to square

217
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,690
one so I think that ideally most people

218
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,310
would have to hit your main docs

219
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,470
obviously you want to have a community

220
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,820
that like talks about your project and

221
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,280
everything but ideally you want your

222
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,780
website for your project to be the

223
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,100
central place where people get

224
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,050
information because the other problem is

225
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,470
that users like it seems really

226
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,330
intuitive to us like oh yeah there was a

227
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,740
blog post for years ago that describes

228
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,790
how to do this why didn't you check that

229
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,590
well it's really hard for users to know

230
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,820
that's right they go to your main site

231
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,840
if they don't find it they're kind of

232
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,920
stuck this is another huge problem right

233
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,740
like all this applies sevenfold's for

234
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,360
like a 100 falls for japanese or

235
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,160
whatever like we have for documentation

236
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,320
English no documentation in the other

237
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,780
language right and obviously that's

238
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,070
really bad because most people don't

239
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,680
speak English so if you want your

240
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,479
project to be successful it should be

241
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,409
really easy to localize your

242
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,460
documentation and this is the absolute

243
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,440
worst problem this is the problem we're

244
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,970
trying to face which is all this other

245
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,040
stuff is kind of okay and expected like

246
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,779
you have got documentation whatever

247
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,390
that's okay as long as it's capable of

248
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,940
getting better but because of the way

249
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,440
most of our documentation systems are

250
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,750
set up we make it so difficult for

251
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,770
people to contribute back documentation

252
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,870
so what we learned is that people who

253
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,310
want to document cappuccino are

254
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,560
generally not our core contributors you

255
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,089
know our core contributors want to write

256
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,190
code it's generally people who are

257
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,080
writing actual apps that want to write

258
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,970
our documentation and they're actually

259
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,220
the best suited for this right they just

260
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,630
spent all this time going through the

261
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,130
hell that you created to learn how to

262
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,290
use your framework now they want to give

263
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,570
that back well now you've got new hoops

264
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,250
for them to jump through right well your

265
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,260
main users are probably not using

266
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,399
version control right they're using your

267
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,080
nightly builds or whatever so step one

268
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,089
is they might have to learn gate or svn

269
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:40,709
or whatever to get your code just to be

270
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,750
able to document it right so that may be

271
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,880
a challenge for them step 2 they need to

272
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
learn how to build your product or

273
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,060
whatever great because you can't to make

274
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,760
code that you haven't built step 3 is

275
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,230
you have to learn how to use kind of an

276
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,330
obtuse documentation tool we used oxygen

277
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,430
it's not the easiest thing to install

278
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,580
and learn and finally they have to learn

279
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,959
your whole you know your culture of

280
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,130
patches or whatever they have to make a

281
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,990
patch they have to send it to you you

282
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,430
might send you know come back with them

283
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,020
with like you're using tabs instead of

284
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,610
spaces or whatever and at the end of the

285
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,170
day it's just really really hard for

286
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,730
them to make any sort of real

287
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,770
contribution and if they really hard

288
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,000
trying to real contribution then you can

289
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,320
imagine no one's ever going to take the

290
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,940
time to do all this to like fix

291
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,800
capitalization or whatever in your code

292
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,330
right and in your comp and your

293
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,360
documentation so now I want to talk

294
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,620
about the problems for us like the

295
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,920
maintainer of projects now there's some

296
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,170
dispute over this this is my opinion I

297
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,029
think documentation in text is

298
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:35,430
incredibly annoying I don't like having

299
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,230
to scroll pages in between methods I

300
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,940
don't like seeing a bunch of stuff

301
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,410
that's designed for other people to

302
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,329
learn I especially don't like seeing

303
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:44,520
HTML in my comments I've already

304
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,870
programming one language I don't want to

305
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,029
see whatever crazy language you invented

306
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:50,339
to like few documentation in my comments

307
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,170
all green right again there's this

308
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,790
problem how do you localize like

309
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,560
documentation and comments are you gonna

310
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,940
have like 50 languages all in the

311
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,390
content of course I and you know

312
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,829
documentation and text in comments is

313
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:06,329
annoying to me imagine to someone who

314
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:07,320
doesn't speak your language where

315
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,880
there's all this foreign language that

316
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,100
old like in some funky color but they

317
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,779
don't understand what it means i've used

318
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,790
japanese source code this sucks i hate

319
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,730
it not japanese source code just

320
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,870
effective you it's in that i'm sorry

321
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,940
just got cut off but it says it requires

322
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,949
specialized tools you know that may not

323
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:27,420
exist for your language and then the

324
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,880
other thing was our framework so the

325
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:38,040
problem with this is that the problem

326
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,449
with this is that there's kind of this

327
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,279
is kind of a spectrum right like on one

328
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,959
extreme you have us we kind of almost

329
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,640
invented a new language right we added

330
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,620
to javascript so day one we had a

331
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,050
problem where no documentation tool

332
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,050
existed to handle our language and

333
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,970
that's you know pretty terrible and i

334
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,020
think we're going to see more more than

335
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,400
that right we're starting to see in the

336
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,350
JavaScript world more people creating

337
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,540
kind of dsl's or you know a brand new

338
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,220
languages on top of JavaScript you know

339
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,750
like coffee script and you know deck

340
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,240
today which is ours and you know right

341
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,110
off the bat you don't have a tool that

342
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,540
can properly look wise I mean properly

343
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,640
document that so what we actually had to

344
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,110
do was use an existing tool called

345
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,300
doxygen and I said oh it should be easy

346
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,640
it's plug-in based I can you know create

347
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,140
a new parser for my language well you

348
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,089
have to write the plugins in C++ and I

349
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:25,980
didn't get into the web to write C++

350
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,529
again so that was out so what we

351
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:30,690
actually ended up doing is someone in

352
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,949
our community took the time to write a

353
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:33,209
converter from objective J the

354
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:34,680
objective-c just we can feed it into

355
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,329
doxygen just so I can get the shitty

356
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:40,140
documentation that we have now so that's

357
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,150
pretty bad and it's also a problem like

358
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,920
in other languages obviously any new

359
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,910
language is going to have this problem

360
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,980
and also in a very dynamic languages are

361
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,810
going to have this to such as Ruby and

362
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,339
JavaScript where you're kind of almost

363
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,050
creating dsl's right like your

364
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,699
documentation tool probably doesn't know

365
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:55,650
that class dog create means you're

366
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,120
creating a class it can't pick up on

367
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,280
that automatically right and yes i know

368
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,939
i misspelled language

369
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:04,860
here's here's the other bad part which

370
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,649
is uh it's really hard to include rich

371
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:09,389
media right and this gets back to the

372
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,610
whole languages within you know your

373
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,519
comments it's bad enough I have to read

374
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,860
this this documentation that's not meant

375
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,389
to me meant for me in the comments

376
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:20,519
without all of a sudden there's like a

377
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,559
video tag in there or random link or

378
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,899
stuff like that and on top of that you

379
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:25,980
know there's a question where you put

380
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,360
this stuff right well if the images and

381
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,499
the videos end up in your source repo

382
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:30,959
then all of a sudden you know it takes a

383
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,339
long time to download my source code is

384
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,689
because they're a bunch of stupid movies

385
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,399
in there right what you should have but

386
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,290
not in your source rebuild and

387
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,420
ultimately just like it's hard for the

388
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,999
people using your stuff to contribute

389
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:47,699
comments I mean documentation it sucks

390
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:49,350
for you to have to actually review it I

391
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,600
can tell you that when i get a commit or

392
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,299
like a pull request which is entirely

393
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,279
documentation the temptation to ignore

394
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,920
forever or you know allow immediately

395
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,660
without review is super high and that

396
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,989
should not be the case so we're working

397
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:05,910
on this new tool close to product we're

398
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,100
not done we're specifically announcing

399
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,709
it to ask for help from you guys and

400
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,600
it's kind of a new take on documentation

401
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,360
you kind of our idea is if you want to

402
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,619
have really great documentation for 10

403
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:18,660
we want a building system that allows us

404
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,499
to quickly build up documentation um in

405
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:23,910
there and we've tried to address all the

406
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,379
different problems and the first one was

407
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,529
the parser problem right every time you

408
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:29,999
start your documentation tool kind of

409
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:32,100
step one is you know a not so fun

410
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,169
programming task of building a parser

411
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:37,139
and what some people have done is create

412
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,730
like little pseudo languages or whatever

413
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,189
to create easier parsers that are you

414
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:44,669
know mainly for documentation but again

415
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:46,169
you have to learn how to use this etc

416
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:49,319
etc so we are really really good I

417
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,790
piggybacking off of other people's

418
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,089
success I think it's one of our best

419
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:56,509
qualities and so what we've done is Oh

420
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,470
first let me say this is the guy was

421
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,110
actually making this is our intern what

422
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,189
he looks like in case you're a visual

423
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:05,519
learner that's as a Twitter he's

424
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,169
actually doing all the work I just sat

425
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:09,029
down and pontificated over the phone to

426
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,680
him and you know he said okay I'll

427
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,830
mented but anyways what we're doing is

428
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,529
using existing technologies and textmate

429
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:19,080
already has a huge storage of language

430
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,140
definitions so basically what Socratic

431
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,970
is capable of doing is if you already

432
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,560
have a text mate bundle for your

433
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,920
language socratic knows how to parse and

434
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,350
create documentation for it and if

435
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,730
you're brand new language and you don't

436
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,020
have a text may bundle well at least

437
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,279
it's two birds with one stone right

438
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,170
because not only are you creating the

439
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,730
documentation parser but you're also

440
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,350
getting you know the plug-in for the

441
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,620
most used text editor for free and so if

442
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,580
you're not familiar with the way

443
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,820
textmate handles source code it's really

444
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,190
quite cool I personally think that text

445
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,660
made is one of the ugliest programs ever

446
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,649
created that's why I don't use it

447
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,839
however internally it is quite beautiful

448
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,120
and this is what it does it actually

449
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,550
creates these things called scopes so

450
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,380
basically you know right here that's

451
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,010
some objective J code that's the class

452
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,630
name and as you can see it knows it's in

453
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,089
the objective J source and it knows it's

454
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:11,790
within a class implementation so as it's

455
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,040
parsing it kind of creates like a tree

456
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,529
of your source code like live right and

457
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:18,600
so here I have a method with in table

458
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,430
view and as you can see once again it

459
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,350
knows working the source code that

460
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,839
subjective J which is no kind of like

461
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,000
JavaScript it knows that if we're in a

462
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,040
you know implementation of a class and

463
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,890
love a blind it even knows that where my

464
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,300
cursor was right here when I was doing

465
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,100
this it even knows that I'm in the

466
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,930
argument types and what kind of type it

467
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,600
is so textmate is incredibly smart it

468
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,980
knows exactly what's going on in all

469
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,010
your source code and there's already a

470
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,959
librarian Ruby called text cow which

471
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,459
uses this information to syntax

472
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,690
highlight and you should check it out

473
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,610
it's very cool and we took this idea a

474
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,750
little bit further and what we actually

475
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,520
do when you run socratic on your source

476
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,579
code is we build up the Dom of your

477
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,320
source this is kind of how you can

478
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,820
imagine it being that that's that little

479
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,490
snippet if you're familiar with HTML

480
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,270
then this should be very familiar to you

481
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,490
we're basically taking all those corpse

482
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,650
and scopes and building the tag soup out

483
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,540
of them and the really cool thing about

484
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,089
that is that that allows us to create

485
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,610
queries right so all of a sudden you

486
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,309
don't have to write parsers for your

487
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,689
language or your DSL or you know

488
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,519
your framework anymore you can just do

489
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,199
queries and this is a very very powerful

490
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,179
thing so this is just like an example if

491
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,429
you imagine docks at Kempton org slash

492
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,340
classes / CP table column you do

493
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,990
something just like jQuery where you say

494
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,850
well give me all the implementations

495
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,159
where the name of the class is CP table

496
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,860
column you can do many more powerful

497
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,320
things too like and cappuccino there is

498
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,120
a convention that all methods that start

499
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,889
with an underscore our private so you

500
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:49,389
could actually say give me all the

501
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:51,460
methods in the class ap table column

502
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,110
which do not start with an underscore

503
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,429
and that's really easy to do with this

504
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:56,289
query language so when you build your

505
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:58,120
templates it's really really easy to do

506
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,460
things like will give me all the strings

507
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,649
within the function class talk create

508
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:03,970
and i'm going to say those are my

509
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,490
classes so it's really a powerful

510
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,720
templating language the second thing is

511
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,460
i think pretty obvious from what i was

512
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,600
talking about earlier if you're not

513
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,399
putting your documentation in the source

514
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,710
code then it's a wiki and it's a media

515
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,240
wiki so people can put movies and

516
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,909
whatever they want the other interesting

517
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:24,399
part is that it's a wiki based on get

518
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:25,899
this is actually one of the places where

519
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm very curious if people have other

520
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,500
ideas the idea here is that we're trying

521
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,259
to make it really easy to keep your

522
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:36,879
documentation up to date with your

523
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,830
source code so what commonly happens is

524
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,000
you have a lot of people running off

525
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,070
trunk but your source code represents

526
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,990
the stable branch and no one wants to

527
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,730
update the stable branch like source

528
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,129
code that's public because well then you

529
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:49,240
know would represent stuff that's not

530
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,179
shipping so what we actually do is since

531
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:54,759
it's a good base wiki it matches the

532
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,820
branches of your source code so if you

533
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,659
tag a release a 0.6 or whatever when

534
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:02,860
people hate your source code they can

535
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,120
actually say well show me the

536
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,279
documentation as it was during 0.6 or

537
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,169
show me what the documentation for this

538
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,210
new feature branches or show me blah

539
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,980
blah blah so it matches all the branches

540
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,700
and creates a pretty powerful way of you

541
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,200
know managing the different

542
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,490
documentation few different versions of

543
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,649
your source code secondly we built in

544
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:25,539
support for date of issues so at some

545
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,340
point we're going to you know make it

546
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,779
generic and let you do whatever right

547
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:29,860
now we're just trying to ship something

548
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,610
so this tries to solve that original

549
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,529
problem of they go to your documentation

550
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:36,050
it's

551
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,600
have to go somewhere else etc what we're

552
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,680
trying to do is you hit the

553
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,560
documentation and you see the

554
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,660
description of the method and right

555
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,190
under it you see all the bugs following

556
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,660
that method right so if you know the

557
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,070
method says you know should return six

558
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,360
and there's a bug filed on it that says

559
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,800
returns five you know immediately

560
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,360
there's a problem you don't need to go

561
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
try it think that maybe it's your fault

562
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,660
end up in the IRC room or whatever and

563
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,280
the next step to this is we would also

564
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,260
really like to include the tests right

565
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,400
next to it so I think would be cool if

566
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,570
you know you have the method description

567
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,060
here are all the bugs and hear all the

568
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,230
tests so if you see that a test is

569
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,670
failing it's almost like an automatic

570
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,740
bug right so we haven't worked on that

571
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,240
part at all yet but the github issues

572
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,260
thing is working pretty well so yeah so

573
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,090
so kind of the sum of what socratic is

574
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,880
doing it's it's using text me bundles to

575
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,950
automatically generate a wiki for your

576
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,440
documentation you know that sits on

577
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,610
topic did so I can you know

578
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,870
automatically track the different

579
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,910
branches and stuff of your revo it will

580
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,200
automatically synchronize with your bugs

581
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,030
and tests and the other thing we've done

582
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,100
is just building out of the box support

583
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,370
for github and the idea is you just type

584
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,290
socratic and then you get URL and you

585
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,880
have a server that's running that's your

586
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,650
your documentation so it should be a

587
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,480
really really easy in the day you took

588
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,700
your code to have really great

589
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,730
documentation for it and of course it's

590
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,380
built entirely on top of common Jas and

591
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,970
this is important for two reasons one

592
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,220
because I think we really need this

593
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,470
right now because you know again we're

594
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,090
kind of a new community for building

595
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,580
lots of new stuff we can really document

596
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,170
it well and the other thing is I think

597
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,790
this could be a really powerful coup for

598
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,180
us because documentation again I believe

599
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,400
to be like a space that's not really

600
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,920
paid attention to a lot and I think if

601
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,840
we create like the gold standard of a

602
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,940
documentation tool we can get a lot of

603
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,380
people to be running how much Jes

604
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,930
servers serving this step up and you

605
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,370
know that will introduce them to kind of

606
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,770
you know JavaScript on the server etc so

607
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,440
I'm pretty excited about that um so what

608
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,460
I'm going to show you now is not the

609
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,290
actual documentation tool it's not done

610
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,760
i'm going to show you kind of the tool

611
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,040
that we use to analyze what's going on

612
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,540
in the background

613
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,570
you'll understand the second so this is

614
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,160
here I'll show you what happens right

615
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,260
now so again when you load this up the

616
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:56,570
first time so again the idea is that you

617
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,550
would not do this in a you I you know

618
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,230
you running off your server but again

619
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,890
it's set up right now to automatically

620
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,140
piggyback off of any existing repo so

621
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,340
I've already have the one set up for

622
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,890
cappuccino and the way the the queries

623
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,210
are working right now is that they are

624
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,490
file based but again you could turn this

625
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,770
around so right now again all it does is

626
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,750
this is this is being automatically

627
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,210
generated from our queries so there's no

628
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,790
there's no fancy parsing taking taking

629
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,230
place we're just saying you know give me

630
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,760
everything that looks like a method

631
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,870
within everything that looks like a

632
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,920
class etc so your dough if you look at

633
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,900
individual methods and again we have the

634
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,090
capability of here are all the bugs and

635
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,520
you can link the bug to the issue and

636
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,950
now those in the system are you know

637
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,620
considered tied together or whatever so

638
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,640
again this is kind of the tool we've

639
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,870
been using to test out these

640
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,670
technologies this is not the way we

641
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,900
think the documentation will look

642
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,050
obviously so yeah we're really excited

643
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,790
about this project again we'd like it to

644
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,950
be ready for one point o before then so

645
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,300
we can actually have dr. really good

646
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,000
documentation we really interested in

647
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,800
your guys's ideas ultimately we want

648
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,240
this to be you know a really great

649
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,580
documentation tool for everyone if you

650
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,200
have any ideas kind of like the things

651
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,010
that have always bugged you about

652
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,990
documentation feel free to talk to us if

653
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,370
you want to start writing code for this

654
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,280
feel free to talk to us there really

655
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,830
isn't a one repo for this yet because

656
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,420
again our interns partially working on

657
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,980
it and we are when the coming weeks

658
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,080
we'll release kind of one place where

659
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,560
all this stuff is together yeah so that

660
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:31,810
is Socratic defense or presentation

661
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,440
alright so that was again saccadic and

662
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,749
now I want to talk about cappuccino just

663
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,709
for a little bit about our new release

664
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,940
the coolest part about the new release

665
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,249
is that and it is built entirely on top

666
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:46,169
of common Jas which means if you're

667
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:47,669
already running Narwhal or any other

668
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:50,700
common gas distribution you can now

669
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,799
install cappuccino with the JavaScript

670
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,570
you know package manager notice tusk

671
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,459
tusk and sell cappuccino and you will

672
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,739
have it the other cool thing is that our

673
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:01,229
entire system is on top of GX which

674
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:02,909
means we don't build with Ruby anymore

675
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,950
we don't require you know our users to

676
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,869
you know install some crazy jam or

677
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:09,059
anything you know we use build tools

678
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,289
that are built with JavaScript we know

679
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:12,450
who's you know JavaScript across the

680
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,729
board all the tools we provide the

681
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:15,959
custom ones are built in public comes

682
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:17,759
yes so I'm really excited about this

683
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,139
this was actually one of our main

684
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:21,119
complaints I really don't understand why

685
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,459
like Ruby comes installed on Mac OS 10 I

686
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,499
never understood why people find this to

687
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:28,320
be hard but whatever you know the users

688
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,909
wanted they don't need to know Ruby

689
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,059
anymore the one I think valid complaint

690
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,739
was that if people wanted to fix bugs in

691
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,479
our build tools or whatever if they

692
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,950
didn't know Ruby then yeah of course it

693
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,450
was going to be hard for them so now

694
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,950
that's not an issue anymore it's one

695
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,559
language across the entire system we I

696
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,879
think are now at a point where we can

697
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,379
have parity with other languages like

698
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:48,989
Python and Ruby or that's the case so

699
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:52,079
it's pretty exciting the other really

700
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,440
cool addition is CP table view this is

701
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,419
one of the classes that was most

702
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:58,859
obviously missing when we shipped Kevin

703
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:00,269
G no it's one of the most used classes

704
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,369
in cocoa it's really really important on

705
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:07,049
the web and on the desktop and this was

706
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,719
created entirely by outside contributors

707
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:12,359
which is pretty exciting to us mainly

708
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,499
because that means I don't have to know

709
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:16,079
at all how it works and that's always

710
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,200
good and it's very performant that's

711
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,139
very beautiful and I not only think that

712
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,299
we have like all the coolest-looking and

713
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,859
performing table views but it's also one

714
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,959
of the easiest to make because we

715
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,149
shipped 08 with nib to sip support for

716
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:31,169
table view modes like to show you that

717
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:35,279
now so if you're not familiar with a

718
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,089
cappuccino we have kind of two main ways

719
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:41,849
that people make kind of you is for a

720
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:42,330
framework

721
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,340
one is with our tool called atlas and

722
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,470
the other one is using Apple's existing

723
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,120
interface builder tool which were

724
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,980
capable of converting into web

725
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,970
interfaces and ever since we released

726
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,039
new to civ this is kind of the main way

727
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,510
that people make you eyes with kevin t

728
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,340
know now because i think it's way easier

729
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,470
so i'll go ahead and show you how you

730
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,850
make a table view in epigenome so here's

731
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,149
this this zip file which if you've ever

732
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:10,860
done anything on mac OS 10 this is kind

733
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:18,630
of how you make interfaces in OS 10 so

734
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,220
this is kind of like the main window of

735
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,679
my application and if i want a table

736
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:32,980
view I just bring it up here

737
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,010
and you know we can add columns and give

738
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,929
it alternating road colors and that sort

739
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:52,450
of thing

740
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,080
so that's kind of all it takes to

741
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,270
actually make the table view and then to

742
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,770
get the data you just need to give it a

743
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,510
data source so we use this technology

744
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,820
called connections so I just connect the

745
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,290
table view to my app controller which

746
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,880
will be providing the data for the table

747
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:27,760
view and then I save it and

748
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:46,670
we go that will convert the file

749
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,270
so this is the table view we just

750
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,220
created and it's got 5 million rows and

751
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,260
as you can see was pretty darn good of

752
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,460
course we're just providing dummy data

753
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,440
but still pretty impressive for went

754
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,720
away they're just so that's how you make

755
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,120
table views in cavaquinho really heavy

756
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,370
with this feature I'd like to try some

757
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,500
more features from table view but I'm

758
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,670
going to take the chance to kind of show

759
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,050
you two features together so something

760
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,140
we released recently with 08 is this new

761
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,520
cap record tool and basically what this

762
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,970
lets you do is record interactions and

763
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,500
basically the idea is you know your

764
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,790
users can kind of record what they're

765
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,470
doing if they have a bug that can send

766
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,640
it to you and then you can see what's

767
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,220
going on so I'll go ahead and hit record

768
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:39,660
here I'll reload the app so these are

769
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,920
kind of the different kind of table view

770
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,120
styles which is like a list style you

771
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:52,200
can sort these rows I guess you can sort

772
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,670
the Rose I'm sorry very good so you can

773
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,570
drag and drop and we've got like

774
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,010
different kind of drag and drop and

775
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:06,960
stuff and if i get stopped one this will

776
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,150
actually save it on the server and then

777
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:20,039
you know wherever the servers running

778
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:53,430
so some apps

779
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,409
so

780
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,429
we go to actually we play again

781
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,549
everything we just did as again really

782
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,989
cool because people can send you you

783
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:04,220
know where they're experiencing bugs and

784
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,700
stuff and then you can profile on your

785
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,619
machine or you know do the whatever

786
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:11,509
debugging you want and what we actually

787
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,159
found which we didn't expect was that

788
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:15,559
this tool was actually really useful for

789
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,580
this device over here the iPad because

790
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,429
as is generally the case with the web we

791
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,559
take one step forward in like a thousand

792
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,889
map so the ipad is really great web wise

793
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:29,539
because you know it's it only runs web

794
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:31,009
kids we can you know rely on all these

795
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,539
fancy features which were usually afraid

796
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,759
to use or whatever but it's really bad

797
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,679
because it's kind of jettisoned us back

798
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:38,659
to 2000 where we didn't have any sort of

799
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,480
tools at all there is basically no way

800
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,549
to debug any sort of web stuff on this

801
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:46,690
device there's a little debug console

802
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,559
built into Safari it sucks I can say

803
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,419
that because I wrote it and it's

804
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,999
terrible like it basically tells you the

805
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:57,559
errors you're having but it cuts off the

806
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:01,340
strings so your goodness you're running

807
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,259
I can see an error it doesn't fit so

808
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:04,759
your best option is to turn it sideways

809
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,289
and then you can see a little bit more

810
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:07,279
of the error because you have a little

811
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,100
bit more room so that's that's a basic

812
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,440
that's basically the extent of debugging

813
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,379
on the iPad so what we've done and I'm

814
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:18,980
just going to load this up here okay so

815
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,749
i guess the other question is well why

816
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:22,009
can't i just a bug in safari they're

817
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:23,869
both WebKit right well that is true for

818
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:25,940
the most part but if you have bugs that

819
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,889
happen due to like touch events and

820
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:30,470
stuff you can't because you know Safari

821
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,970
does it have touch events on this

822
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,859
machine and you can take the time to

823
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,059
like manually recreate the events

824
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,669
yourself but that's a real pain so this

825
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:38,720
tool is really great because you can

826
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,039
actually let me so take a second to load

827
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,559
here you can actually do whatever

828
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,629
interactions you want on the iPad let it

829
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:50,749
crash and then you can run it back here

830
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:53,419
and then profile it or you know catch

831
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:55,399
the errors or break on the air and see

832
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:57,049
exactly what's going on because you know

833
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,220
we can translate all the events and

834
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:05,700
everything so I me do some stuff here

835
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,150
again I'm sorry that I'm not showing you

836
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,840
this live we wanted to hook it up but as

837
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,870
it turns out this thing does not export

838
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,030
video by default like your app has to

839
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,830
support that feature and we thought it

840
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,539
was silly to write a native app to wrap

841
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,340
the WebKit to show how cool web apps are

842
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:29,450
on the iPad so hopefully I can now show

843
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:45,900
you this here

844
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,260
so take a second load up Cyrus our

845
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,610
servers pretty slow

846
00:32:52,620 --> 00:33:06,000
when I just made

847
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,470
here you go so as you can see that's me

848
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,940
doing all the touch events and stuff and

849
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,860
you know getting all the wonderful CSS

850
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,400
redraw errors as you can see so this

851
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,720
allows you to go in there to bug see

852
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,630
what's going on yeah so I think that's

853
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,580
pretty cool we've been using this tool

854
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,220
to write a kind of an iPad app that we

855
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,480
are going to open source soon it's

856
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,490
called scrapbook I'll show you that very

857
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:31,210
briefly this is this this we're going to

858
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,740
open sources completely and we're also

859
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,050
going to release it and basically lets

860
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,930
you create scrapbooks um so come here

861
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:44,260
you know you can choose a template this

862
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,820
is pretty cool it actually grabs the

863
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,200
images straight from your facebook

864
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,160
account this is using a new plug-in for

865
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,720
cappuccino called Facebook kit that we

866
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,150
released recently so as you can see

867
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,440
you've got like different templates and

868
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,160
stuff and you know you can you have the

869
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,040
images and drag them in and do touchy

870
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:09,970
kind of things so yeah so that's pretty

871
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,139
cool again we're going to be open

872
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,879
sourcing this the other cool thing is

873
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:13,899
we're going to be releasing this and

874
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:15,340
we're going to have a print button so

875
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,990
will actually send you your scrapbook

876
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:20,679
printed out in paper so you can show it

877
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,940
to your grandma who does not have any

878
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,700
ipad or apparently those are built for

879
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,050
her so maybe it'll be for you so one of

880
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,730
the cool things about the way we built

881
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,639
this app is that we used atlas to do it

882
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,409
so Atlas is this other tool was talking

883
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,730
about like we have nib to save which is

884
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,990
completely open source so you don't have

885
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,310
to pay us or anything to use it and

886
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,649
Atlas is kind of our version of this

887
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:44,110
Apple tool and the really cool thing

888
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,840
about it is we recently added this

889
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,040
plugins feature where you can write your

890
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,149
own custom UI plugins for Atlas so if I

891
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:57,600
open this out this is the project and

892
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,100
what we did was write a plug-in for kind

893
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,260
of our scrapbook pages so we're actually

894
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,770
able to give our designer just Atlas and

895
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,840
this plug-in and he doesn't need to send

896
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,250
us Photoshop files that we need to cut

897
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,360
up or anything he can actually just

898
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,450
build these templates himself so show

899
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,480
you that

900
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,320
so it's all the little template pages

901
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,480
you saw running on the iPad there are

902
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,250
actually created right here so this is

903
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,580
how we lays them out and again doesn't

904
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,930
need to know any code or anything and

905
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,580
you know these things have their own

906
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,680
little custom inspectors so it comes

907
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,900
here and you can say well this is

908
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,460
actually a cover back color or page

909
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,770
whatever and and this is really cool

910
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,940
because you can write your own custom

911
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,590
ones of these so if you're using Atlas

912
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,380
and you have a new UI element you can

913
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,120
write your own inspectors and you know a

914
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,590
lot of people to use it yeah and you can

915
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,790
actually do this interface builder too

916
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,750
so if you want to write your own IP

917
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,370
plugins again in the open source world

918
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,110
without having to deal with us you can

919
00:35:55,110 --> 00:36:01,050
do that and finally the last thing I

920
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,790
wanted to show that we're actually

921
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,580
announcing today this is not part of 0.8

922
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,790
is an improvement to nip to sip and we

923
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,900
thought it was a good we've actually had

924
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,030
this kind of under wraps for a while but

925
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,740
we thought it was a good time to talk

926
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,150
about this feature given all the stuff

927
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,680
that's going on with you know what

928
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,810
languages you're allowed to use on you

929
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,120
know iPad and not and I always thought

930
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,440
it was not a very interesting question

931
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,210
of you know how to get more stuff into

932
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,250
the ipad i think you know if Apple wants

933
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,730
to you know have the lock and key to

934
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,650
this device that's fine to me much more

935
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,300
interesting question is how do you get

936
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,540
stuff that's already on the iPad out so

937
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,100
as I've already said like we have this

938
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,420
technology called nip to see which is

939
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,450
capable of transforming Mac os10 desktop

940
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,180
apps into html5 web apps well we've

941
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,030
actually extended you to save to allow

942
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,590
the same kind of thing to happen with

943
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,970
iphone app so I'll show you that very

944
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,600
quickly right here just like before i'm

945
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,970
going to open up apples tools this is if

946
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,230
you've never built an iphone app this is

947
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,640
kind of how you do it these are like

948
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,820
their visual tools you can come in here

949
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,870
and you know

950
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,570
set everything up so I'm obviously

951
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:16,410
building something very simple here and

952
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,550
if I hit run this launches the iPhone

953
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,080
simulator well this isn't my bug this is

954
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,160
apple stuff Oh hurt all right there um

955
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,540
so you know since I'm very obviously a

956
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,890
very simple out right so what we do is

957
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:40,190
if we save this now I can go here and

958
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:49,870
just like before i can run new cusub

959
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,499
oh sorry

960
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:56,569
there we go I think Lou the the family

961
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:59,539
area so now what the app that started

962
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:04,919
off as an iphone / ipad app or whatever

963
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:07,009
will show up on the web and it's

964
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:08,479
completely converted and this will run

965
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:11,929
on android or on palm OS or whatever and

966
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:13,549
again we've started off with just like

967
00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:15,229
three or four classes just like when we

968
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:16,459
originally wrote a new to sit for the

969
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:18,079
desktop that we're adding more and more

970
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,239
classes and just like right now in it to

971
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,039
save is a very very complete tool if

972
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,959
you're going from desktop to web

973
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,909
hopefully in a little while this will be

974
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:27,499
a very complete tool to go from iphone

975
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:29,809
to the web so we're pretty excited about

976
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:33,079
that and i guess i'm running out of time

977
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,429
so i was going to show you a few apps

978
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:36,529
running on a late but since i'm at a

979
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:44,519
time i will just end it there and say

980
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:47,479
yes this enforces the urls to get to all

981
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:50,029
this stuff again do you want to contact
