1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:23,250

i am i'm rockbot on the interwebs so

2
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,420
follow me whatever I work at NPM NPM

3
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,610
started out as open-source but it's a

4
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,740
company now and I was actually employee

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,409
number one and as employee number one I

6
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,909
was a web engineer and then I moved up

7
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,190
to being a tech lead in the web team and

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,659
now I'm the engineering manager for the

9
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:42,719
web team and today what I'd like to do

10
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,989
is kind of take you through NPM kind of

11
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,269
like to stir it over but let's just kind

12
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:50,219
of play with NPM a bit today but before

13
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,870
I do that the first thing I want to do

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,479
is kind of talk a little bit about NPM

15
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,239
NPM is a package manager for JavaScript

16
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,579
a lot of people think NPM means node

17
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,199
package manager

18
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,329
it turns out it doesn't mean that it's

19
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,129
just three random letters that someone

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,070
put together it you could say that it

21
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,740
has no prescribed meaning okay but

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,180
here's the other funny saying Java

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,619
scripts a bit of an is a misnomer as

24
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,070
well because there's CSS in our

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,859
repository earth in the registry there's

26
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:25,439
go there's rust there's C++ so in

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,380
reality NPM is just a package manager

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,909
but I'd like to think it's pretty cool

29
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,240
and our number one priority at NPM is to

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,359
reduce friction you all have an

31
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,359
important job to do you want to write

32
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,579
code push to production make cool stuff

33
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,399
the last thing you want is to have your

34
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,310
tools get in the way so everything we do

35
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,560
every product you build every service we

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,799
create the major takeaway for us is is

37
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,920
this going to make your lives easier so

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,340
with all of that in mind let's build an

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,719
app our app is going to be a random

40
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,450
wombat fact generator and it's going to

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,039
be a command-line client because we

42
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,360
don't have a lot of time and I just kind

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,450
of want to get moving

44
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,810
whatever now this is a wombat it's a

45
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,590
marsupial native to Australia and you're

46
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,150
PI wondering why wombats that seems

47
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,340
ridiculous well it turns out if you take

48
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,360
the NPM logo and you flip it around it

49
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,420
no longer says NPM it says wdu which

50
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,910
obviously not obviously really means

51
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,660
wombat developer Union and all of the

52
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,310
people at NPM we've refer to ourselves

53
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,319
as wombats and this is our little mascot

54
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,269
and if you want to know why were the

55
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:41,769
wombat developer Union and why we chose

56
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,959
a wombat in the first place come find me

57
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,090
afterwards I have a bunch of stickers we

58
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,410
can talk about wombats and NPM and all

59
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,049
that good stuff okay so I'm going to

60
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:51,849
start talking really really really fast

61
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,980
the good news is this is being recorded

62
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,599
so you can go onto YouTube later and you

63
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,890
can go ahead and put it down to a one

64
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,810
point or a point five X so that you're

65
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,940
not talking about fast but we've a lots

66
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,470
of stuff to cover so great okay the

67
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,459
first thing that we're gonna do in

68
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,290
building this app we are going to

69
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,500
install node J s if you haven't already

70
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,209
I personally prefer to go to node J s

71
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,540
org - and press the big green button

72
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,030
it's easy it's fast you can use homebrew

73
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,739
or whatever else you want I just prefer

74
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,150
to go straight to the source

75
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,230
now NPM comes bundled with node but N

76
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,600
Pam's release process is at a different

77
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,030
rate then nodes release process and

78
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,230
we're gonna hear all about nodes release

79
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,620
process later for miles but suffice it

80
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,470
to say that most of the time when you're

81
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,389
installing node you probably have a

82
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:40,000
slightly out of date NPM in fact if it's

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,010
been a few weeks since you updated NPM

84
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,739
go ahead and update it again so you want

85
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,630
to go and Pam I NPM at latest Ashby

86
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,730
fantastic okay now let's get to building

87
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,000
this app are we ready we're gonna do

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,670
this live to do okay so here we are

89
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,139
we're in our nice little terminal

90
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,180
fantastic and the first thing I want to

91
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,280
point out is that any time you have

92
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,530
questions or whatever from right within

93
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,389
your terminal you can ask ask for help

94
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,579
and it's really it's an easy you can

95
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,169
just kind of be like alright well what

96
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,030
do i do how does this work fantastic

97
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,789
okay moving on so the first thing we're

98
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:19,989
going to do is we're going to create a

99
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,480
directory

100
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,310
of random wombat facts this is gonna be

101
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,570
our application and if you're looking at

102
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,850
this and going what kind of syntax is

103
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,470
that that's not bash it's cuz it's fish

104
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,200
shell I like it I'm not gonna have a

105
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,980
shell war with you but I'm okay

106
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,300
so we're creating an application so the

107
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,260
first thing that we're gonna do is we're

108
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,020
gonna do NPM an it now NPM an it is an

109
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,240
automated tool to create a package dot

110
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,580
JSON your package JSON is essentially a

111
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,770
manifest file for your entire app it's

112
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,930
where the computers basically gonna say

113
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,700
okay what dependencies do you have what

114
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,110
is the name of your app what version is

115
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,400
it on what's the description all of

116
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,150
those good things

117
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,760
now you could of course totally make it

118
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,980
by yourself but why would you do that

119
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm a lazy developer I don't know if

120
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,950
you're lazy developers but I'm totally

121
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,740
lazy developer and if I can I totally

122
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,050
want my computer to do all the work for

123
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,650
me so here we are in this automated tool

124
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,230
and anything that's in parentheses is

125
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,420
kind of a default and so I'm like okay

126
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,310
you know what named random wombat backs

127
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,130
that sounds great version 1.0.0

128
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,750
fantastic description random wombat fact

129
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,300
generate or fantastic entry point we're

130
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,100
gonna have some file called index at J s

131
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,230
that sounds good we won't have any tests

132
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,270
just ignore that and no get repo

133
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,100
whatever it's fine we're doing it live

134
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:41,910
and so wombats fast jazz cough fantastic

135
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,500
so some keywords that will be useful for

136
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,600
searches later and then you need to add

137
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,610
a license now is C is a pretty standard

138
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,710
open-source license but in the event

139
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,030
that you don't want to license something

140
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,800
you know what you don't have to license

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,680
it you can just say unlicensed is this

142
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,680
okay yes sounds great so now all we have

143
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,480
in here is just a simple back package

144
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,720
JSON and that's what it looks like and

145
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,860
this is what's gonna be stored in the

146
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,300
registry and this is what the website

147
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,220
uses to kind of show off what version

148
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,320
you're on and all that good stuff okay

149
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,200
so we know that our entry point is

150
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,690
indexed is so we're going to go ahead

151
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,200
and build that so let's do an index J is

152
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,540
and we're going to am I going too fast

153
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,560
fantastic good okay so we're going to

154
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,980
create a really really really basic

155
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,070
little array

156
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:40,190
facts and we're just gonna do and this

157
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,520
is gonna be the easiest little nodejs

158
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,350
script you've ever seen we're just gonna

159
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:50,930
console.log this fat and cool and now

160
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,580
we're gonna do it note index a a yes and

161
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,310
boom that's our fact one okay beautiful

162
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,170
we don't have to applause yet

163
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,480
plaws later love applause all if you

164
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,710
want applause I'll take the applause

165
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,290
okay all right so this was great but

166
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,520
what do we really want to do we want

167
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,160
something to randomly grab one item from

168
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
that array right now of course we could

169
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,130
totally just go ahead and say um mascot

170
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,640
random mascot floor some algorithm in

171
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,860
you know what someone has probably

172
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,540
already written this because it is the

173
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,070
most commonly used code for any

174
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,040
randomizer so let's just see if maybe a

175
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,140
package like that already exists so what

176
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,630
we gonna do we're gonna go to NP MJS

177
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,280
calm and we're going to open up the

178
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,260
search and I know what you're thinking

179
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,560
you're gonna say Vachel and cams are

180
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,850
just terrible not anymore

181
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,810
alright so what do we see here just kind

182
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,010
of we just put in a little search for

183
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,440
random array and hey would you look at

184
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,490
that get a random item from an array

185
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,020
that's exactly what we're looking for

186
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,480
Thank You syndra Soros okay so we're

187
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,500
going to take a look at that package

188
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,250
page and sounds cool so in order to

189
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,200
install it we do an NPM install - - to

190
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,240
save random item and then we're gonna we

191
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,770
have an API for using it so let's go

192
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,410
ahead and do that we're going to say and

193
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,950
p.m. install random item - save

194
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,590
beautiful fantastic and the reason why

195
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,890
we do - - save is because again we want

196
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,050
that package JSON manifest to kind of

197
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,730
have all of our dependencies listed in

198
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,820
there and we could do it Ottoman we

199
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,580
could do it ourselves but I'm a lazy

200
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,020
developer and I hope you're a lazy

201
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,970
developers - so why do it ourselves when

202
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,860
the when the you know program can do it

203
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,680
for us plus it tells you it goes ahead

204
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,750
and saves the exact version that you're

205
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,570
using all the names

206
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,800
you don't worry about typos or anything

207
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,570
so if we wanted to take a look at the

208
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,970
package.json you can see right here we

209
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,530
have our random item dependency

210
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,740
beautiful okay now this is less of an

211
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,600
NPM thing and more of an ode practice

212
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,970
thing I don't always believe everything

213
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,110
I read on the internet so I'm gonna do a

214
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,540
little trust but ferret by type thing so

215
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,580
in case you're not aware node has a read

216
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,350
eval print loop also known as the repple

217
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,720
where you can kind of sandbox with

218
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,870
packages that you've installed and so as

219
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,280
long as you've already installed it into

220
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,540
the current directory you just as do

221
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,580
node and then you can kind of play with

222
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,090
a you can play with the the packages

223
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:33,550
that you've just pulled in and and you

224
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,230
can kind of just do okay so according to

225
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,200
the readme the API is just a Rando of

226
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,320
array and it should just pull okay cool

227
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,450
so this works exactly as I expect it's

228
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,820
pulling random ones fantastic

229
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,270
so now I'm gonna go ahead and update my

230
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,430
index a J yes to have this right am

231
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,700
andum item require random item and

232
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:10,540
update this to have random item and now

233
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,770
if I do node index J yes all right back

234
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,530
to fact to fact one alright cool so it's

235
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,620
doing exactly what we were asking for

236
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,410
beautiful okay so that worked exactly

237
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,960
the way we wanted and now I'm going to

238
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,290
so okay again really lazy I'm such a

239
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,900
lazy programmer I really don't like

240
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,000
writing node index dot G is over and

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,200
over and over again and what I'm about

242
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,430
to do is gonna make a go

243
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,080
you didn't actually make it better but I

244
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,950
want you to think about your own

245
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,570
applications where you're kind of like

246
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,430
when you're starting up your app maybe

247
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,320
it's not just a single point of entry

248
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,390
right maybe you have a gulp script that

249
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,740
you want to run before you start your

250
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,500
app up maybe you have a test suite that

251
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,670
you want to run before you start your

252
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,620
app up well we're gonna create an NPM

253
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,450
start script and the way that we do that

254
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,400
is we go into our package JSON

255
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,830
and we create a new script called start

256
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,720
and there are a few scripts that have

257
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
special keywords like start and test is

258
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,730
that you can just use NPM start and I'll

259
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,110
show you that in a second but you can

260
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,260
just do basically index node index dot J

261
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,940
yes and now if I do npm start it'll run

262
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,160
the exact same thing and so it's just a

263
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,990
little bit of an easier thing like i can

264
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,640
set whatever it is i want you can you

265
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,779
can also change that to be a bash script

266
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,730
if you really want it to but you can

267
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,260
just have it you can put it I just bash

268
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,600
straight into that into your package a

269
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,390
JSON so that's pretty cool but I don't

270
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,050
know if you noticed my my codes a little

271
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,730
wonky I've got some semicolon some

272
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,589
places and some semicolons not in other

273
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,980
places and you know missing so what's

274
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,450
one thing that I could do to kind of

275
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,580
clean up my code well I can use a

276
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,000
package like standard to go ahead and

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,510
clean this up because you know what am I

278
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,040
doing here again I don't want to have to

279
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,540
think about this I want to have other

280
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,760
other modules take care of this for me

281
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,589
so I'm going to go ahead and and Pam

282
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,220
install standard and again I'm lazy you

283
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,230
don't have to use and can install you

284
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,260
can just do NPM I and I'm gonna do a - -

285
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,930
save - dev I can also change this to

286
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,670
just - D with a capital D now so here's

287
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,730
the thing about standard and actually

288
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,150
any module usually you would kind of

289
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,250
install it globally with a - G kind of

290
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,370
like we did with NPM but it turns out

291
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,459
you don't ever I mean ever have to

292
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:35,500
install a module globally so especially

293
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,510
if you have an application that you're

294
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,950
working on and other people on your team

295
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,020
are also working on the exact same thing

296
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,730
you know sometimes you're like oh shoot

297
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,230
I completely forgot to tell you have to

298
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,970
install this one thing globally you

299
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,290
don't have to do that ever ever ever

300
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,930
again just install it as a dev

301
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,779
dependency because you're the whole

302
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,640
point of dev dependencies versus regular

303
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,690
dependencies is that your dev

304
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,800
dependencies don't need to go into

305
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,300
production they have nothing to do with

306
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,830
your actual code it's just kind of sad

307
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,690
stuff so okay so you've your dev

308
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,490
dependency in there and then I'm gonna

309
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,480
go ahead and create a new rum script

310
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,860
and I'm gonna call it standardized and

311
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,130
Amna dues runs standard and what that's

312
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,680
going to do for me is I can do npm run

313
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:25,600
standardized and because standard is a

314
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,700
it's not a reserved word so like start

315
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,620
or test you have to use the word run

316
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,000
there you can't just say npm

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,890
standardized you NPM run standardized

318
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,600
and so there were a whole bunch of

319
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,670
errors oh my gosh why well it's because

320
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,830
standard had a bunch of errors and it

321
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,660
said hey look you you had extra

322
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,760
semicolons and that was really gross cuz

323
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,050
standard apparently doesn't like

324
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,270
semicolons whatever standard fine

325
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,520
compromise you're doing the job that I

326
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,300
want to do so uh the recommended fix is

327
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,060
- standard - - fix now a lot of people

328
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,340
kind of would say oh well I guess I'll

329
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,470
have to create a brand new start startup

330
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,530
script or NPM run script so that I can

331
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:08,750
have a - - fix in there but fun fact you

332
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,940
could just as easily and Pam run

333
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,760
standardized if you add a - - right

334
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,200
after your run script you can add

335
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,760
parameters that you would normally add

336
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,370
to your command line and so I basically

337
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,100
just ran - - fix on the NPM run

338
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,080
standardized and you can see what

339
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,210
essentially happened is it ran standard

340
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,430
- - fix for me so that's pretty cool -

341
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,230
okay so from there good okay so now I

342
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,540
want to build another module I want to

343
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,720
build a module of wombat facts right

344
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,060
now the difference between a package and

345
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,520
a module is that a package is something

346
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,830
that you would that you can kind of

347
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,220
install with NPM but a module is

348
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,430
something that you can actually use with

349
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,750
nodes module loader so you'd use the

350
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,790
require syntax and so not all packages

351
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,910
or modules but all modules or packages

352
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,990
ish but yeah so we're gonna do is I like

353
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,460
to modulate my code I like to break it

354
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,570
up into different pieces and I just

355
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,790
think about well what kinds of modules

356
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,800
would other people want to use I have no

357
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,090
idea what kind of things people would

358
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,070
want with what random on that facts but

359
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,490
that's cool we're going to

360
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,279
bill that anyway so let's go and create

361
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,830
a brand new directory called wombat

362
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:30,089
facts mmm and we're gonna go into that

363
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,420
directory now creating a module is the

364
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,790
exact same process as creating an

365
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,800
application we're gonna do an NPM in it

366
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,959
now here's the thing about NPM in it if

367
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,529
I'm totally cool with all of the little

368
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,540
automated bits and pieces I can just say

369
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,940
unpin minute - - yes and it'll take care

370
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,230
of it for me you can also do just a

371
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,080
regular - why and so no it doesn't have

372
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,970
the description or the keywords you know

373
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,770
what I'm lazy and that happened really

374
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,209
fast I did you press ENTER like a whole

375
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:59,970
bunch of times so that's pretty nice and

376
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,430
now I'm going to go again into index -

377
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,529
is but because I'm creating a module I

378
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,800
need you module dot exports and I'm

379
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,160
going to create this fact one in fact

380
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,510
two in fact three and that's all

381
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,520
fantastic and so that's cool and what I

382
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,930
think a lot of people would do right now

383
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,580
is they would kind of publish with some

384
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,500
sort of alpha thing or whatever to try

385
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,630
to test it on their other application

386
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,209
you don't have to do that thing is I

387
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:31,680
don't want anybody to accidentally

388
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,930
download this right now I just wanted to

389
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,310
check to see if it works in my regular

390
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,140
application so I'm going to use is a

391
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,839
thing called an cam link and what an cam

392
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,490
link does is it creates a sim link

393
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,000
between your your working directory and

394
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,329
a directory and user local Lib node

395
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:51,270
modules and then I'm gonna go ahead and

396
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,300
go back to my random wombat fax

397
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,160
application and I'm going to do NPM link

398
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,470
wombat fax and what that does is it

399
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,600
creates another sim link from that user

400
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,149
or local Lib node modules and puts it

401
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:05,730
straight into my node modules now for if

402
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,040
you were wondering node modules is where

403
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,520
all of your packages live and so so

404
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,890
that's pretty neat and now if I were to

405
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,449
now it's kind of like you had just

406
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,339
installed it even though I didn't really

407
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,360
install it because I didn't really

408
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,850
publish it now I can go into my index a

409
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,920
Jas and I can change these facts here to

410
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,440
require wombat facts and if all goes

411
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,990
well if I can just do NPM start

412
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,910
and I should still get fact one fact

413
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,860
three or whatever but if you're a little

414
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,050
bit like okay wait but it said fact one

415
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,970
in fact two facts three before that's

416
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,140
cool let's go ahead and update our index

417
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:56,100
at Jassim real wombat facts and so

418
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,290
here's some real wombat facts and note I

419
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,670
haven't done anything I don't need to

420
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,100
NPM link again I don't need to do I need

421
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,450
to publish or anything and I'm just

422
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,830
gonna go ahead I just changed

423
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,960
directories back into my random wombat

424
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,130
facts app and I'm gonna NPM start and

425
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,020
turns out they have a backwards facing

426
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,570
pouch like other marsupials wombats give

427
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,670
Berk to a tiny underdeveloped baby that

428
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,020
calls into its mother's pouch to grow

429
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,910
and develop further but wombats pouches

430
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,290
have a special difference they are

431
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,880
positioned backwards opening toward the

432
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,950
mothers rear rather than their head this

433
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,270
allows her to dig without getting dirt

434
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,220
in her pouch that's a pretty cool little

435
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,160
fact also wombats have slow metabolisms

436
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
it takes the wombat up to 14 days to

437
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,000
digest a meal this low metabolism helps

438
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,380
them out and they're hot and dry habitat

439
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,570
so very cool I think it's pretty cool

440
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,220
okay

441
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,400
alright now I'm ready to go ahead and

442
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,350
publish this module the first thing when

443
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,570
I do is into NPM unlink so it kills it

444
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,410
takes out that at that sim link and now

445
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,250
I'm going to go ahead and publish it now

446
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,330
keep in mind that in order to publish

447
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,310
you need to have an account on NPM you

448
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:09,220
can either NPM you can NPM log in and I

449
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,010
think you can do an NPM signup I think

450
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,360
it might be an M camp sign up so you can

451
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,710
do that on the CLI or you can just go to

452
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,000
the website and create an account there

453
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,800
or if you already have an account then

454
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,400
just make sure you NPM log in for sure

455
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,740
now I'm a little weary about creating a

456
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,160
wombat facts like high-level module me

457
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,990
because somebody else already took the

458
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,970
name or I'm just not sure I'm ready to

459
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,650
do have that kind of commitment to the

460
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,860
public so what I could do is I can scope

461
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,050
this module and what that means is I can

462
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,960
put it under my username scope usually

463
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,420
we think about scopes as an organization

464
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,610
scope which you have to pay for your

465
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,790
company has to pay for orgs or a private

466
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,250
scope like a solo account where you can

467
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,260
basically create private modules but

468
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,920
guess what

469
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,930
you can totally create public scoped

470
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,820
modules to and the way that we do that

471
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,000
is we go into our package a JSON I'm

472
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,760
going to change this to at rockbot slash

473
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,610
wombat fax and if you're ever curious

474
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,010
about if you're logged in or not if you

475
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,390
just do NPM Who am I

476
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,100
it'll tell you who you're logged in as

477
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,760
so good good trick and so now I can do

478
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,690
and PM publish with a dash dash access

479
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,570
equals public so with that that allows

480
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,170
you to create a public scoped module and

481
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,710
it should work so now I've published it

482
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,910
and I can go ahead and take a look at

483
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,520
this if you're wondering about this

484
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,930
thing it's I'm using Alfred fax and lo

485
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,450
and behold here we go I've published it

486
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,600
and it's a version 1.0.0 and that's

487
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,870
fantastic ooh um oh no no readme found

488
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,440
what do we do

489
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,580
let's go ahead and create a repeat and

490
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,600
so we're just gonna kind of do a really

491
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,679
quick read me and now when you create a

492
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,340
readme it's not really a major change to

493
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,620
your module instead it's just kind of

494
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,110
like a little thing so what I'm gonna do

495
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,240
is I'm gonna bump my patch version I'm

496
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,250
gonna put my version to bump the patch

497
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,830
and so you can actually use NPM version

498
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,519
patch and so you can do patch minor or

499
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,690
major and I'll talk about that in just

500
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,669
second and then you can add a little bit

501
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:34,460
of a tag like I'm creating a readme or

502
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,549
something like that and what version

503
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:40,789
will do is it'll not only update your

504
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,679
version number but it'll also create a

505
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:44,600
new commit if you have a github repo

506
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,700
it'll create a new commit with all of

507
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,590
these updates and it'll create a new get

508
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,169
tag so when you push up make sure you

509
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:56,179
remember to get push and get pushed

510
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:00,080
- tags but I don't have a github repo

511
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,389
for this project right now so ignore

512
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:06,580
that but if I do an NPM publish again

513
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:12,019
now as soon as it publishes I should be

514
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,110
able to find that pack now there should

515
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,179
be a readme tada

516
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:23,690
okay fantastic

517
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,980
okay so let's say I totally didn't like

518
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,159
this at all and I really want I just was

519
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,230
not a fan so I can unpublish and I can

520
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,919
just say unpublish and what end him

521
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,659
unpublished tends to do is if you only

522
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,379
have one little module if you only have

523
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:45,789
one version it'll go ahead and delete

524
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:48,700
that one version or it'll unpublish just

525
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,059
one pieces of it but specifically it's

526
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:54,369
good to say explicitly what version you

527
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:57,070
want to unpublish so I can you know NPM

528
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,929
unpublish rock that one about facts at

529
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:03,549
one point 0.0 because I really didn't

530
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,629
like the fact that didn't have a readme

531
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:07,359
so cool I can unpublish that or if I

532
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,450
want to unpublish everything I can

533
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,109
unpublish with a dash F or a dash dash

534
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:16,509
force and that one publish the entire

535
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:20,730
package in its entirety and you know I

536
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,109
we sure hope you know what you're doing

537
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:26,919
when you do that but then as you will

538
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,909
see it's not found it's totally gone now

539
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,769
one major thing that a lot of people try

540
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:35,109
to do is they'll go hey wait a second I

541
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:39,940
I want to I want to publish I want to

542
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,159
republish version 1.0.0 well let me tell

543
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,940
you that is not a good idea and here's

544
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,289
why let's talk about semver for a second

545
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:55,029
miles borns is going to go a little bit

546
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:56,710
more in detail about some verse I'm just

547
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,519
gonna do a really really high level

548
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,279
version but with December some very

549
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,919
semantic versioning it is a handshake

550
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,080
that you do with the rest of the

551
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,879
developer community at least within the

552
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,700
NPM land where you basically say I

553
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,539
promise

554
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:13,809
I sure do solemnly swear that I am up to

555
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:17,139
very good and what you're basically

556
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:20,230
saying is whatever this number is when I

557
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,299
make a change I will update this number

558
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,859
to reflect the type of change that I'm

559
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:27,159
about to do so the the last digit is

560
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,539
going to be your patch and that's

561
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:30,279
something that's like okay if I have

562
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,740
some bug fixes or I forgot to add a

563
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,309
readme

564
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,529
doesn't actually affect the code that

565
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:37,149
much it's just gonna be like this tiny

566
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:40,749
tiny thing now you can use NPM version

567
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:44,409
patch to to bump that and then if you

568
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:47,799
have a minor so if you change the middle

569
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,840
number that's because you've added some

570
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,519
new features maybe you've extended your

571
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,899
API or you've you know just kind of made

572
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:57,940
something a little bit cooler so that's

573
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,519
a minor that's npm version minor and

574
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,169
then if you have a major breaking change

575
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,289
like your deprecating a function you are

576
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:06,970
completely rewriting how a function

577
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,669
works you're using modules that have

578
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:11,590
also totally had massive breaking

579
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,299
changes then you're gonna go ahead and

580
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:14,980
bump that in major and that's NPM

581
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,190
version major and so again this is a

582
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,779
handshake that you're making with the

583
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:21,730
rest of the community when somebody

584
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,399
comes in and to support and says hey I

585
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,159
accidentally unpublished my version 1.0

586
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:27,580
point

587
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,220
oh and I don't want to create a new

588
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,669
version 1.0 point one can I just rewrite

589
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:36,669
1.0 point oh no you can't and the reason

590
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,259
for that is that you've now violated the

591
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:39,970
handshake that's kind of like giving

592
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,830
somebody a present and saying hi I

593
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,899
bought you a present it's this really

594
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:45,639
amazing cake and it's chocolate and

595
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:47,740
delicious and then saying oh wait a

596
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,440
second I'm just gonna take that back and

597
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,509
then and then you kind of like give them

598
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,129
like a vanilla cake instead and it's

599
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:56,320
like a vanilla cake is good but it's not

600
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,460
the chocolate one that you gave me

601
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,490
originally why why what happened my

602
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,529
chocolate cake right and slowly that's

603
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:04,299
the community is expecting you to uphold

604
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:06,340
this and here's the fun fact versions

605
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,019
are cheap they're completely free

606
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:09,909
they're completely free so it's totally

607
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:11,619
okay if you have to bump your version

608
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,480
number but you know a little patch a

609
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,759
point point 0.1 so cool there's more

610
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,769
there's totally more there's always more

611
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:23,049
but we don't have time for all of that

612
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:25,269
unfortunately so here are a few things

613
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:27,970
for you to totally look up fun of

614
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,129
dependencies and kim shrink-wrap their

615
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:31,929
configuration options that will totally

make your whole workflow a lot better
