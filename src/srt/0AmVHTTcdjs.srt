[Music]

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,750
hi I'm Sophie I'm an engineer at Monza

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,450
Bank in London in the UK I'm gonna talk

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,000
about the power of the community and how

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,710
it's helped me and also how it can help

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,070
you and so the way I see it I see the

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,840
wider tech community is being made up of

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,570
three kind of parts so there's my work

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,810
community my online community and my

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,489
community of people at meetups and

11
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,350
conferences just like this and I'm gonna

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,000
talk to you what these are and explain

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,160
how they help me and also give you some

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,399
tips on how to make the most of them so

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,290
my work community consists of people

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,000
I've worked with people I work with now

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,920
people I work with in the past and

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,500
they've got so much experience and

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,739
different backgrounds from me and so

20
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,660
having learnt from them over the past

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,750
like four years I kind of I've learnt so

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,280
much about things I wouldn't even have

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,109
any idea about because you know they've

24
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,760
been engineering for longer than me or

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,260
they came into engineering in a

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,900
different way from me and I started my

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,820
career in a really big company with a

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,320
lot of people who had been there for a

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,900
very long time and they had a lot of set

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,670
ways of doing things that hadn't changed

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,350
in years and you know people come along

32
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,820
and say oh let's let's do it this way

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,150
and people say oh no and and we actually

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,979
brought in a lot of contractors which

35
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,299
you know the people who had been there

36
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,670
forever didn't approve of but it working

37
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,110
with them was actually eye opening

38
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,790
because I got to learn so much about

39
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,189
what other companies were like how other

40
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,470
people did things and you know I made

41
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,090
friends with him I stayed in touch and

42
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,439
when it was time for me to look around

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,079
elsewhere those people and some of my

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,460
old colleagues were able to give me

45
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,810
advice because they've worked with me

46
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,369
and they knew what I was like and they

47
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,189
knew what I would like so when it comes

48
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,409
to building your work community make

49
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,240
sure that you bring yourself to work so

50
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,220
be honest be genuine and people will

51
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,200
really appreciate that and they will do

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,290
the same meet as many people as you can

53
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,060
so a Monday we've got a slack channel

54
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,649
that pairs you up randomly with a new

55
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,600
person each week and what this is great

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,950
for is just finding out more about how

57
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,540
your company works and finding out what

58
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,759
different people do and stay in touch

59
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,440
with people when they leave or when you

60
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,660
leave and your network will just widen

61
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,740
and widen and

62
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,600
you never know where you or they might

63
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,920
end up so about the online community

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,810
chances are some of us are on some kind

65
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,850
of social network I put money on it that

66
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,130
it's Twitter but you don't have to do

67
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,200
this but it for me it was a game changer

68
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,050
I used to stay away from Twitter until I

69
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,910
so that someone pointed out to me that

70
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,590
it's a bit like radio you can tune in

71
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,500
whenever you want to and so I posted a

72
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,970
tweet asking for advice because I was

73
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,740
giving my first ever talk last year and

74
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,620
I got so many replies of such amazing

75
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,240
information that I turn it into a blog

76
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,950
post and then turn that into a talk

77
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,620
bonus so I've learned so much from

78
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,720
people on these different social media

79
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,790
platforms and if Twitter is not your

80
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,440
thing you could try an online community

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,710
like ADA's list or dev - code newbie or

82
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,890
their various slack or discord groups my

83
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,840
tip for that is share interesting

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,730
conversation tent that you see it

85
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,410
doesn't have to be your own stuff but it

86
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,480
will spark conversations and it's all

87
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,820
about post quality not quantity

88
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,350
so don't post lots and lots and lots

89
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,630
hoping that people will pay attention

90
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,580
post a few times but really good stuff

91
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,340
or really terrible jokes go down very

92
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,080
well as well and finally the thing I

93
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,310
thought I think has had the most

94
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,170
profound effect on my own professional

95
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,940
development is meeting people at meetups

96
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,040
and conferences just like this some of

97
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,840
them are in this room right now and they

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,160
helped me to build up a network of

99
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,780
friends that I can talk to about the

100
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,060
industry about salaries which is a

101
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,520
really important thing to talk about

102
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,740
what it's like where they work and just

103
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,360
understanding what the industry was like

104
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,150
in my area so these friends helped me

105
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,740
realize that I was actually being really

106
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,990
underpaid at my last job and so when it

107
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,790
came to applying for a new job I knew

108
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,050
the kind of figures that I should be

109
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,540
asking for and mentoring at workshops

110
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,610
like code bar which has just started

111
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,560
here in Berlin was fantastic for

112
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,020
strengthening my own self belief and for

113
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,520
dealing with the imposter syndrome that

114
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,020
I feel like is inevitable in this

115
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,300
industry and companies could often be

116
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,130
very singular in their culture so it's

117
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,600
important to meet other people in the

118
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,910
same area as you so you understand what

119
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,120
other places are like and it's really

120
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,770
easy and rewarding to give back to the

121
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,989
community as well whether it's by giving

122
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:24,180
talks mentoring other people or even

123
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,680
just getting your company to host a

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,430
meet-up

125
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,370
I chose my current company company Mons

126
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,380
Oh partly because it hosts so many

127
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,430
meetups and its really community minded

128
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,410
to sum up I owe these communities so

129
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,850
much they helped me to understand where

130
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,470
I want to go and how to get there and

131
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,810
I'm now in a role that I absolutely love

132
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,850
in a in a company I never dreamed I

133
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,770
could work for and I'm just having a

134
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,210
great time and it's because of these

135
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,490
people say thank you to the people that

136
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,080
I've worked with who helped me grow and

137
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
helped me move on thank you to the

138
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,370
people online who boosted my signals and

139
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,990
got me loads of really amazing advice

140
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,180
and retweeted my terrible jokes and

141
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,800
thank you to the people in this

142
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,449
community who has supported me along the

143
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,190
way and got me to where I am today

144
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,080
and I'm always happy to talk about this

145
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,699
so you can find me on Twitter I've got

146
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,380

[Applause]
