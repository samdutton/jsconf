1
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,560

hey so my name is Dave Ulmer I with this

2
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,170
framework called Joe because I figured

3
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,370
there weren't enough mobile frameworks

4
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,870
out there in the world right now based

5
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,170
on html5 actually sorta development on

6
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,590
this about a year ago so it's been kind

7
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:54,070
of percolating behind the scenes you can

8
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,540
applaud early this that's okay that's

9
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,730
fine okay so yeah I've been kind of

10
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,530
lurking in the JavaScript community for

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,649
for some time now so this is my first

12
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,619
open source JavaScript project mostly I

13
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:11,050
get paid by people to do things that you

14
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,210
know stay proprietary and hidden behind

15
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,390
the scenes see I've been programming a

16
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,050
while pretty pretty much a geek so I'll

17
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,539
just move on so yeah what is joe joe is

18
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:28,960
a application framework for mobile

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,840
devices most of the cool smart phones

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,369
today have either webview with web kit

21
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:40,360
or something very much WebKit like so i

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,470
took a look around at some of the older

23
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,759
frameworks that have been kicking around

24
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,380
some of the things that I've done in the

25
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,110
past and kind of wondered what would an

26
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,000
application framework specifically a UI

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,610
framework look like if you just started

28
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,130
from scratch and said well if I don't

29
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,360
have to support IE six seven or eight

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,200
you know can you write a smaller

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,880
framework can you leverage some of the

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,679
cool stuff that's into css3 and all this

33
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:06,700
thing that we're calling html5 n turns

34
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,619
out you can end up with a pretty small

35
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,890
library so Jo has a pretty robust set of

36
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,620
widgets a simple data layer and gzip to

37
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,819
minified it's kicking around 12 k and if

38
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,830
you want to do how to work with

39
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,900
basically anything except IE anything

40
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,700
before ie9 it's actually working value 9

41
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,860
pretty well these days it's designed to

42
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,840
work with phonegap so how many people

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,400
are familiar with with phonegap for

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,069
mobile development all right okay

45
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,430
brian's brand arose very happy so Joe

46
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,019
was designed to sit for mobile

47
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:43,709
applications on top of the phonegap so

48
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,790
as you may know with phonegap

49
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,079
basically what it gives you is sort of a

50
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,909
baseline compatibility layer between all

51
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:51,640
the different mobile OS is out there but

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,900
what it doesn't ring to the party is

53
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,049
sort of all the cool native like widgets

54
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:58,480
and controls for for putting a nap

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,299
together so Joe is designed to sort of

56
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:06,700
sit on top of that or the great layer so

57
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,340
no this is you know a pretty typical

58
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,530
block diagram of you know the

59
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,519
architecture pretty simple Joe is a very

60
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,829
lightweight framework so you don't have

61
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,750
to use it for everything if you want to

62
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,040
fill it with the Dom directly because

63
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,139
you have some last-minute hacky thing

64
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,370
that you have to do for your app to get

65
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,159
it out the door go right ahead Joe Sri

66
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,389
they're not going to get in the way it

67
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,519
has no other no dependencies on any

68
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,760
other libraries so the big plus there is

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,480
is that you don't run into any

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,500
incompatibilities so if you want to mix

71
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,099
in other lives to get your app together

72
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,069
Joe's not going to get in your way if

73
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:47,470
you're using phonegap with iOS and

74
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,139
Android basically for those that haven't

75
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:51,900
used phonegap allows you to create

76
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,870
installable native ish mobile apps use

77
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,470
html5 technology so on these platforms

78
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,459
iOS and Android phone taps will give you

79
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,400
sort of a web view and then sort of a

80
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,829
native app wrapper and then inside that

81
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,840
webview you can put your your JavaScript

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,090
html5 CSS app and then some other mobile

83
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,760
platforms so I work at HP that's my day

84
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,919
job how many people are familiar with

85
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:24,789
webos okay cool cool that's actually

86
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,320
yeah all right that's a lot of hands

87
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,349
cool so let's go about webos is

88
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,479
something like PhoneGap is there mostly

89
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,360
as a compatibility layer webos native

90
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,639
apps are basically web apps or at least

91
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,630
they use web technology so kind of

92
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,360
another flashback to when the iphone

93
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,789
came out i was a big fan mostly because

94
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,320
apple got up in front of everybody and

95
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,419
said hey does anybody remember what they

96
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,960
said right right right web app so

97
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,200
basically Apple said the web is the SDK

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,690
this is you know new breed of smartphone

99
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,320
you don't

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,270
special SDK all you need our web apps so

101
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,400
it was all on board with that and got

102
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,540
well underway writing if you absolutely

103
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,370
sort of came back a year later and said

104
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,220
well web does the SDK except for this

105
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,190
new thing that we're calling the actual

106
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,850
sdk for for apple so I still bear maybe

107
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,020
a little bit of bitterness towards that

108
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,000
and so when webos came around and

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
actually said the web is the sdk and

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,220
then actually you know came through on

111
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,770
that promise that definitely attracted

112
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,700
me over to HP to work on that Joe is

113
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,540
also open source has a freebsd license

114
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,430
so you can pretty much do anything you

115
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,890
want with it and i'm really hoping to

116
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,480
actually get a lot more code

117
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,760
contributors i've had a few so far who

118
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,560
have mostly done a few bug fixes out a

119
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,350
few pieces here and there but Joe is has

120
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,800
reached the size where you know to sort

121
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,050
of get it out there and get it to beta

122
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,330
and have a go live definitely like to

123
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,940
find a couple more folks who are you

124
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,170
know really enthusiastic about the

125
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,040
approach that I'm taking with his

126
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,080
library and have a little spare time on

127
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,820
their hands to to chip in so I'm going

128
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,650
to go over real quick the the basic

129
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,040
philosophy behind Joe because it is it's

130
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,190
a little different so just sort of show

131
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,960
of hands like how much how many people

132
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,860
are familiar with say sencha touch okay

133
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,360
it's not bad sencha touch is relatively

134
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,070
new what about jQuery Mobile okay

135
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,690
actually about the same about 5050

136
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,840
between the two so to me these sort of

137
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,690
represent sort of the two polar extremes

138
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,770
of what we have out there right now with

139
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,980
sort of html5 based mobile technologies

140
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,270
we've got jQuery on the one side which

141
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,520
jquery mobile does pretty much you know

142
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,530
what you created except they have like

143
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,060
sort of a mobile widget library laying

144
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,820
on top of it and you know if you code in

145
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,120
jquery mobile you spend a lot of time

146
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,770
more on the HTML side and then you sort

147
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,170
of add the javascript kind of as you go

148
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,760
which is that's so that's one approach

149
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,770
and then on the other end of the stream

150
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,350
you've got something like sencha touch

151
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,729
which is similar to you say

152
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,629
sprout core or even going back to dojo

153
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,300
which is more JavaScript centric so

154
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,669
using javascript to creat your app the

155
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,469
fact that there's sort of a dominant in

156
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:26,379
there is sort of sort of a means to the

157
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,159
end rather than than a focus so Joe

158
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:33,729
leans a little bit more towards the

159
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:37,839
sencha touch side but I can do this in a

160
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,249
second here but yeah I'm going to skip a

161
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:44,710
slide and come back so what a lot of

162
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,819
these frameworks that are very

163
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,339
javascript heavy tend to do is come to

164
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:50,559
come to the play come to our platform

165
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:53,770
saying well javascript parts of it are

166
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,389
kind of hard you know prototypal

167
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,120
inheritance is tough and gosh you know I

168
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,309
we come from a better language that has

169
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:03,129
proper classes and things like that so a

170
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,399
lot of frameworks will create these

171
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,569
really sort of intricate patterns and

172
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:13,719
machinations to sort of create a what I

173
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:16,059
call a sort of a language experience

174
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:19,719
inside JavaScript you know these

175
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:21,459
libraries do some cool stuff but that

176
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,990
that's never really set too well with me

177
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,020
I happen to actually love JavaScript at

178
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,529
its core it's my personal belief that if

179
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:34,360
WebKit were more up to snuff today we

180
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,010
really wouldn't need sort of any UI

181
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,819
frameworks whatsoever and even though I

182
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,560
wrote 1 i'm i'm actually genuinely

183
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,719
hoping at some time in in the next five

184
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,300
years or so well i'll be using vapor jas

185
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,449
basically to get our apps done so

186
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:52,089
between now and absolute adoption of

187
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:56,829
vapor jas we have something like Joe Joe

188
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,630
has a lot of the things that I like one

189
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,130
of the things that I really appreciate

190
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,000
about jQuery is method chaining took me

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,019
a little bit to really enjoy that way of

192
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,649
doing things but it's very handy i also

193
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,449
have a constructor nesting in here now

194
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:15,699
i'll show that off in a minute when we

195
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:19,810
get to the code stuff but basically a

196
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,029
lot of stuff that's in Crockfords you

197
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,949
know javascript the good parts show of

198
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,060
hands everyone should know this book

199
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,860
right

200
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,020
javascript a good parts okay yeah so all

201
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,420
of the good parts stuff Joe is pretty

202
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,040
much in line with i agree with about

203
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,320
ninety-five percent of what is in

204
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,070
Crockfords book and so a few old

205
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,380
favorites like observer pattern which is

206
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,089
all over yui particularly yui too and

207
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,490
for those folks who are big fans of

208
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,980
binds i support it if you don't want to

209
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,470
do that all of the event handling you

210
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,260
can pass in a context s in an optional

211
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,620
parameter so joe tries to be pretty

212
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,440
accommodating so in addition to not

213
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,500
trying to fix javascript you know rather

214
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,000
than having a bunch of Java scripts you

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,880
animate things on the screen hey require

216
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,700
css3 use the transformations and the

217
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,010
transitions that are built into it and

218
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,600
the reason that's important particularly

219
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,790
would go with mobile is you have slower

220
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,630
machines they have less memory available

221
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,050
for you to do funky things like manually

222
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,030
move things around not to mention some

223
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,570
of us is out there kind of throttle the

224
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,310
the timer interval that you can use in

225
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,190
your apps so you might find that you can

226
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,260
only move things you know ten times a

227
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,170
second for example if you're too you

228
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,150
know manually go through and move things

229
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,520
around yourself another goal with Joe is

230
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,400
uh keep the code light is absolutely

231
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,640
small as possible without making it

232
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,180
completely unreadable so the car service

233
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,920
coming up I like to think if Joe were a

234
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,579
person Joe would be Indiana Jones

235
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,610
basically all the cool stuff you can

236
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,150
think about Indiana and then then maybe

237
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,830
yeah maybe that'll get you sort of in

238
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,950
the mindset basically face you know like

239
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,760
in the smart flexible lightweight and

240
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,080
dress up if he needs to you know anyone

241
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,029
wear a tux you know if the occasion you

242
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,470
know requires same thing with Joe if you

243
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,740
want your app to look extremely you know

244
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,660
special and yours and branded and all

245
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,180
that other cool marketing speak just go

246
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,000
to the CSS and tweak it you know make it

247
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,890
look the way that you want you don't

248
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,590
have to just use all the

249
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,850
default styles that come with all the

250
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,640
widgets and get the job done again as

251
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,520
quickly as possible so having said that

252
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,140
and this goes back to what I was talking

253
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,710
about a little bit earlier today it's

254
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,310
more like young Indiana Jones basically

255
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,870
showing a lot of promise and i think

256
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,090
when we get into the code and some of

257
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,920
the examples you can definitely see that

258
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,570
it's it's off to a good start a little

259
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,950
bit rough around the edges again

260
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,290
definitely trying to run up some more

261
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,860
code participation in this to help take

262
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,410
it right now it's pre-beta so at least

263
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,970
take a debate and hopefully get it

264
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,850
shippable okay we'll do a quick

265
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:29,190
comparison so this is the obligatory you

266
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,970
know size comparison chart and for those

267
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,010
of you who are not in a food coma

268
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,470
because we just ate lunch may notice

269
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,300
something mix little fishy here this is

270
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,070
using my favorite size comparison metric

271
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,190
which is the number of bytes that it

272
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,780
takes in the name of the framework so in

273
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,960
this case you can see Joe only takes two

274
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,110
bytes or two characters for the Unicode

275
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,970
folks xui very lightweight takes 30 5

276
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,980
and on down now I think Joker emo

277
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,060
jquery-mobile would have been a lot

278
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,220
smaller if they left the word mobile off

279
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,870
of it the same thing was with sencha

280
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,260
touch but in all seriousness so this is

281
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,900
a bit a bit more us here in comparison

282
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,790
this is sort of give you kind of a

283
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,500
mental map if you're familiar with the

284
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,510
mobile framework landscape that's out

285
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,840
there so on the top of the chart we have

286
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,050
more more minimal sorts of frameworks

287
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,280
in-depth oh and and Xu I are sort of

288
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,720
what I would consider to be sort of a

289
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,140
jquery light they're very very small and

290
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,780
if what you want to do is manipulate the

291
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,880
Dom sort of by hand in your JavaScript

292
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,410
these are fantastic libraries for doing

293
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,900
that across platform and then sort of on

294
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,360
the opposite end of the spectrum you

295
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,860
know you've got to essentia touch sprout

296
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,610
for dojo mobile s come out recently they

297
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,540
tend to be a bit bigger

298
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,519
they tend to be a bit more ambitious as

299
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,310
far as what they're trying to do and

300
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,529
they tend to sort of take the approach

301
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:01,980
of here's how your app is laid out and

302
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,639
sort of inject your your logic into our

303
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,160
framework so they tend to use the word

304
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,410
framework very seriously I tend to use

305
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,319
it more in terms of features rather than

306
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,810
trying to direct the way that that you

307
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,180
code your a pub so I like to think of

308
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,920
Joe sort of occupies kind of a sweet

309
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,279
spot between those two spectrums and

310
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,990
then over here you've got a jQuery

311
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,000
Mobile jQuery Mobile is is a bit bigger

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,569
than something like Zeppo and xui but

313
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,769
they're trying to do a lot more they're

314
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,339
trying to support you know not just mart

315
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,139
phones but you know feature phones and

316
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,199
not just installed apps but you know the

317
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:41,339
browser's on these different phones

318
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,930
which can vary wildly in quality but

319
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,190
again they have a very different

320
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,329
approach in the way they do that so

321
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:56,279
anyway move on and so let's get into

322
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,800
some code examples this is actually a

323
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,120
really terrible example but it gives you

324
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,100
an idea of you know how where you would

325
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,750
start with Jill basically you're setting

326
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,019
up an empty index HTML you're loading in

327
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,779
the CSS and then if you have application

328
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,540
CSS on top of that you load that to you

329
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,389
load in the framework and then you've

330
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:18,480
code up your app which is pretty simple

331
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,610
it's like when you example you'll notice

332
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,579
I'm using the new keyboard I happen to

333
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,199
like it I happen to like prototypical

334
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,170
inheritance there's a some really nice

335
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,389
built-in stuff in JavaScript that deals

336
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,660
with its its natural way of handling

337
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,240
well not really classes but classes and

338
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,329
inheritance so I'm a firm believer that

339
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:40,589
if you're writing JavaScript you

340
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,279
shouldn't break things like instance of

341
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,980
which can be very very useful so I'm

342
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,329
going to pop out of this and into an

343
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:56,110
actual editor

344
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,490
and while enduring that do we have any

345
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,260
any game throwing like a couple of quick

346
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,550
questions if anybody has it has one not

347
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,080
yet okay you want to see the code first

348
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,960
I understand yeah slides are not enough

349
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:19,700
okay so and by the by all this stuff so

350
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,680
I don't I didn't know how good our Wi-Fi

351
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
would be actually it says I have to say

352
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,570
this is bet one of the better Wi-Fi

353
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,380
situations I've seen in a conference

354
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,690
like in the last year so that's really

355
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,260
cool ya round of applause for the Wi-Fi

356
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,560
but i am prepared so if for some reason

357
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,540
you can't get it for whatever reason i

358
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,420
have flash drives to pass round with all

359
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,660
of this stuff on it okay cool so let's

360
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,250
pop up say a really simple sample

361
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,070
everybody read that do we need to bump

362
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,990
the font size up a bit okay someone said

363
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,730
yes so I'm going to comply how about

364
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,730
that readable anyone can't read put your

365
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,510
hands up awesome so they can either read

366
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,760
it perfectly or the too embarrassed to

367
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,350
put their hands up either way it's good

368
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,140
for me okay cool so here we have sort of

369
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,490
the shell and this is an old example so

370
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,380
those of you who are actually paying

371
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,179
attention don't look at what I just

372
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:30,890
deleted the old doc type for a one

373
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,309
strict good old 401 strict right yeah

374
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:37,730
okay so we don't need that anymore so I

375
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,860
have a lot of funky stuff in here which

376
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,590
I've set up in this index.html basically

377
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,670
all of these meta tags here are for iOS

378
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,070
and a couple of them for android and

379
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,530
webos actually uses them to this sets up

380
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,020
the viewport and make sure that the app

381
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,520
actually shows up at the proper

382
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,809
resolution and all that type of good

383
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:04,269
stuff

384
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,480
so we have the standard style sheet with

385
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,149
joe i have a special style seed sheet

386
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:10,500
that i did for the sample app which are

387
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,559
show you in a second and i'm going to

388
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,409
move this guy up here and for those who

389
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:19,080
actually are using iOS and want to take

390
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,720
this from a web app and make it a an

391
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,659
offline running web app yeah there you

392
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:28,350
go it's a little icon to do that so

393
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,620
anyway just tagging on to unload here

394
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,169
because I'm lazy and I'm calling my app

395
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:37,350
load and then I've got the jo Jo script

396
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,480
and then I've got the YQL GI script so

397
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,600
the index HTML page on that page but the

398
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,049
file is actually just sort of a sort of

399
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:48,600
an empty shell empty canvas and puts all

400
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,980
the pieces together and okay cool so

401
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,779
this is the actual business end of this

402
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,080
app the way that I chose to code this

403
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,019
one up is using sort of the the the

404
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,460
object literal or the singleton pattern

405
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,259
Joe doesn't really judge joe doesn't

406
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:08,279
really care how you write your

407
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,549
application if you want to do your app

408
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,309
all based on if you wanna make it

409
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:15,480
functional that's fine if you want to

410
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,159
use sort of this pattern that's fine if

411
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,500
you like the module pattern that's great

412
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,320
like Joe doesn't really care so as far

413
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,440
as hitting up your applications

414
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,370
architecture I mean that's up to you I

415
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,139
mean it's I really don't feel like it's

416
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:31,289
a frameworks business to tell you you

417
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:32,730
know how to put together your app I feel

418
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,519
very strongly about that so singer call

419
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,059
to the same called Joe load and then

420
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,629
I've got Joe has a built-in control

421
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,639
which makes a little bit easier to make

422
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:47,370
yql calls how many people for me with my

423
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,129
key well you know who's awesome query

424
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:52,049
language service you can shout and Cheer

425
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,899
because it is awesome yeah mallu okay

426
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:57,539
other for you so we've got two two boots

427
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:01,440
for that so what YQL does is it sort of

428
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,269
like sequel but for but for the web so

429
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:07,200
any sort of data that's out there

430
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,610
preferably XML assured or jasonich it

431
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,049
can sort of put them together data from

432
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:14,730
Desperate Reese resources put them

433
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,720
together into something that

434
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,070
your app can digest more easily so here

435
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,980
basically setting yql select and it is a

436
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,200
lot like sequel so select title from RSS

437
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,039
wear and I'm giving you this URL and RSS

438
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,039
happens to be a service it's a comes

439
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,929
bundled with YQL basically it'll pull

440
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:38,370
the data off of any RSS feed did you

441
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,480
give it and so this particular example

442
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,820
I'm doing sort of long-form so in other

443
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,230
words i'm sort of creating each element

444
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,150
as i go along and then putting them

445
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,429
together later again Joe doesn't care if

446
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:52,320
you want to do it sort of this way and

447
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,549
i'll show you a slicker way to do it in

448
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:57,419
a minute so here i'm creating a new list

449
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:03,480
widget so new Joe list and I'm passing

450
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:11,250
in yql Joe yql is a it's an extension of

451
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,679
a base class it's in Joe called Joe

452
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,840
datasource and what that does is

453
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,190
essentially basically two wraps an array

454
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,330
of objects of whatever that you want so

455
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,090
the list control happens to accept a

456
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,799
data source so in this case we're

457
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,460
passing in YQL and what that means is is

458
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,070
that whenever YQL the response goes out

459
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,260
and then comes back with the data this

460
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,760
control this list controller we've just

461
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,710
defined will get notified of that data

462
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,110
and then it will be told to present that

463
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,400
data the next line here we've got list

464
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,010
dot format item equals blah blah blah so

465
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,900
if you if you want to do this sort of

466
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,780
you know the right way you could create

467
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,850
your own application specific version of

468
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,919
Joe list which I'll show you how to do

469
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,179
it and second basically if you're

470
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,990
familiar with the extend method to send

471
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,210
JavaScript the good parts it's really

472
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,760
similar to that but if you're really

473
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,130
lazy you can just make a new Joe list

474
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,830
and then sort of over right it's it's a

475
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,070
form an item function and so the format

476
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,919
item method basically takes data from

477
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,590
each of the each of the array elements

478
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:27,450
and its job is to turn that into some

479
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:27,630
time

480
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,250
nodes or an HTML fragment for the list

481
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,830
view itself to turn around and present

482
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,530
pretty straightforward I've got a button

483
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,380
that we're creating you notice here

484
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,840
we're starting to get a little bit of a

485
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,890
little bit of our chaining so we've got

486
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,550
a new button we're giving it a title of

487
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,060
go and all these widgets have different

488
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,280
types of events that they that they

489
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,830
publish button has one called select

490
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,080
event so I'm going to subscribe to that

491
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,110
a select event and I'm going to tell it

492
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,150
whenever that happens I wanted to call a

493
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,740
method that's in my app called refresh

494
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,830
and because i don't really like buying

495
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,480
that much i'm going to pass along a

496
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,880
reference to this app object up here

497
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,750
even more lazy coding so adding to the

498
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,930
chain here i've got a set style so this

499
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,950
is an example of you know a lot of you

500
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,630
know the sort of foreign extreme of

501
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,830
widget sort of oriented frameworks they

502
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,970
don't really mess once you messing

503
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,370
around with sort of the nitty-gritty Dom

504
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,450
elements they want you to use their

505
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,960
widgets and do things the right way and

506
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,570
you know extend it and add stuff to it

507
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,150
and things like that Joe is perfectly

508
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,670
fine with letting you sort of fiddle

509
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,070
with things on the fly this in this

510
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,900
particular example this wouldn't exactly

511
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,390
be what you call production code but if

512
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,260
you're trying to put together a quick

513
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,760
prototype and you have to make a quick

514
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,980
tweak because someone from your product

515
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,190
team or you know your consultant your

516
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,930
client run walks by and says gosh what

517
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,310
would it look like if we change the

518
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,960
color blue you can do that really

519
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,400
quickly without having to fiddle with

520
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,930
your CSS okay so setting up a new button

521
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,520
so that's everything we need to do for

522
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,490
setting up the button we're setting up

523
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,410
just a empty variable right now for

524
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:29,150
input and this is an example of

525
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,220
constructor nesting that was talking

526
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,960
about so sort of like method chaining

527
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,370
in that it's a kind of slick it can look

528
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,690
really cool if you know what it's doing

529
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,029
and it can look mildly confusing if

530
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,880
you've never seen it before but the

531
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,470
advantage is is that you when you're

532
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,299
done you actually get a feel for the the

533
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,820
structure of your UI so this would be

534
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,399
something akin to if you did this with

535
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:58,409
the templating language or with straight

536
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:00,299
HTML you'd actually sort of see the

537
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,370
structure of you know what elements

538
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,789
contain what etc etc so here we're

539
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:08,010
creating a new screen screen this is a

540
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,750
defined by default to sort of fill the

541
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,610
interior area of whatever container it's

542
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:17,279
in so in this case we're actually just

543
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,980
filling the window itself whatever size

544
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,679
it may be we're creating a container

545
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,020
within it and then we have the same

546
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,110
called flex row so flexible x ro just

547
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:33,059
uses the flexible box model so again one

548
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,110
of the nice things about doing mobile

549
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,350
apps is you tend to have more feature

550
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,919
support for a lot of the newer css3 and

551
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,230
things like that doing the input and

552
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,760
again another little site style just for

553
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,039
fun and lists so if we look at this main

554
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,230
thing Joe screen will see that we're

555
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,850
passing in really what this is is just

556
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,909
an array there's an array of different

557
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:59,820
widgets that are being passed in so I'll

558
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:12,310
show you real quick what this looks like

559
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,350
okay i'm going to rescind the phrase

560
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,100
real quick and just downgraded to

561
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:31,130
shortly okay okay cool so we open this

562
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,929
up and we get something pretty simple we

563
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,340
don't have any scrollers set up so it's

564
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,200
using whatever native stroller you

565
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,669
happen to have on your system so if

566
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:44,149
you're setting this up say on iOS inside

567
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,490
a one webpage you just have you know

568
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,450
your page which is sort of scroll from

569
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,620
any and as you can see in the browser

570
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,909
we're just using the native scroller

571
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,519
really doesn't do much beyond that

572
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:57,110
allows you to change this who has an RSS

573
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,110
feed they don't mean to pull up short

574
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:09,500
has to be short what shorter this was a

575
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,789
bad idea i can't type any of these

576
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:17,299
things okay i'm just get that yes

577
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:18,889
basically give it a RSS feed it runs

578
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:23,450
through yql using the joe yql wrapper

579
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,220
class that we have and then pushes it

580
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,929
through DUI that we have defined so

581
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:34,129
that's a pretty simple example any

582
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:35,389
questions so far in this one because it

583
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:41,389
had introduced a lot of joe joe isms and

584
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:42,950
yet okay you want to see more code I get

585
00:27:42,950 --> 00:28:02,000
it all right

586
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,390
so this is the sort of old kitchen sink

587
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,530
sample and if you notice of doing this

588
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,670
we're actually writing mobile apps right

589
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,200
now even though we're sitting inside the

590
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,680
browser the nice thing about that if

591
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,770
anyone who's done mobile app development

592
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,300
debugging on device or even an emulator

593
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,270
can be challenging particularly in some

594
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,060
cases using web-based technology

595
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,550
actually even getting console.log to

596
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,050
come out and see what's going on much

597
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,250
less being able to step through and

598
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,190
debug things so the nice thing is is

599
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,810
that you can get your app most of the

600
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,630
way done inside the browser and then use

601
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,550
the debugger that's built into Chrome or

602
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:46,350
Safari Firefox okay so this is a pretty

603
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,010
simple sort of kitchen sink you know so

604
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,540
we've got our little physics based stuff

605
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,830
all that's done with css3 and really all

606
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,990
that Joe is doing is altering the class

607
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,610
name of the elements that are being

608
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,830
scrolled around the big advantage with

609
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,960
that is well one using css3 it's going

610
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,060
to in many cases use hardware

611
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,860
acceleration it's built on to the device

612
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,780
so you're gonna get a lot smoother

613
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,020
action out of it and the other thing too

614
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,270
is is that you can alter the way the

615
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,950
physics sort of that you set up in the

616
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,940
scroller by tweaking the CSS rather than

617
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,580
digging around in your JavaScript so

618
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,840
this page it shows off some of the

619
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,160
different widgets this is like a

620
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,180
pulldown widget this is sort of a toggle

621
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,260
on or off this is a pulldown it has you

622
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,820
know arbitrary fields whatever you want

623
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:43,930
to put in it we've got buttons etc etc

624
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,710
this one looks rather boring unless you

625
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,020
see what it's doing underneath what this

626
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,840
is doing is it's loading in HTML

627
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,150
snippets from another place so if you

628
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,540
wanted to say do help system you

629
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,450
basically give it an HTML file and tell

630
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,940
the to render as one of these cards so

631
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,120
back up a little bit here

632
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,670
options basically he fills it up however

633
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,080
you want text fields work pretty much

634
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,860
like you you'd expect and all of the

635
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,120
stuff is the mobile and skinnable

636
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,140
completely in css3 for the main project

637
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,890
CSS for Joe I use less CSS anybody from

638
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,960
a row that one it's kind of like kind of

639
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,770
like SAS okay so some hands I assist CSS

640
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,260
compiler makes it a little bit easier to

641
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,290
do things like themes and such

642
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:44,440
expandable text area blah blah blah

643
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,000
fairly simple table control basically

644
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,410
has event handlers for when the user

645
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,700
interacts with it like as a tap on a

646
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,830
cell and such like that you can set up a

647
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,580
you can subscribe to that event with any

648
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,430
methods that you want you uses a an

649
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,720
event model similar to Yui to which is

650
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,920
sort of the observer pattern so you can

651
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,210
have as many controls there's many

652
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,400
arbitrary hunks of your code subscribing

653
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,130
to any anything that you want basically

654
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,250
and you can sort of chain up behaviors

655
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:19,500
based on that here's an example of using

656
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,350
flexbox type stuff do you like say it

657
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:27,420
the TV remote app ignore this part down

658
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:34,410
here and then this is the example of an

659
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,970
on-demand view again this page is kind

660
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,320
of boring unless you know what it's

661
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,430
doing behind the scenes which I'll show

662
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,780
you real quickly so Joe has a sort of a

663
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,230
convenience wrapper for defining

664
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,080
something like a card view or a set of

665
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,500
UI widgets without actually having to

666
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,030
instantiate them until you need them and

667
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,730
so I'll show you that in a second none

668
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,160
first pop-ups you have to have pop-ups

669
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,910
in any library alright so let's going to

670
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,650
the code I'm actually not going to do

671
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,940
the whole code for this because there's

672
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,250
kind of a bunch but I'm a touch on some

673
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,450
of the more interesting bits

674
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:19,180
so in this particular one setting up

675
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,790
using the more of the module pattern

676
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,640
bum-bum-bum lots of comments explaining

677
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,140
what's going on lots of commented out

678
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,820
code so this is your original kitchen

679
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,000
sink demo so there's a lot of commented

680
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,610
code that's been commented out so here's

681
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,470
an example of creating a new card called

682
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,560
in this case menu I have defined I did

683
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,150
VAR menu up above so I'm just putting

684
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,850
this in line two so we're create a new

685
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,780
card inside that card we have a list

686
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,930
inside that list we have this data we're

687
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,150
just coding it in line because it's its

688
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,270
static we're setting a title for it and

689
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,300
so that's our menu and then we're

690
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,220
setting up a handler front whenever this

691
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,400
menu gets activated what we want to do

692
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,110
is to tell it the list to deselect

693
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:11,860
whatever item was selected last time and

694
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,600
that that basically gives us this card

695
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,250
right here that code we just looked at

696
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,840
setting up our screen using a flex

697
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,430
column now what the Flex column does is

698
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,280
allows us to have distinct sing at the

699
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,350
top and the thing floating down at the

700
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,350
bottom which can be interesting on iOS

701
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,490
basically needs a lot of hacks out there

702
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,800
some of which involve giving up and

703
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,380
doing native controls for you know any

704
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,170
of the headers in the toolbar down below

705
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,150
but you don't have to do that Joe

706
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,830
scroller actually performs very well in

707
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:55,150
iOS so it works pretty well ok defer log

708
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:01,430
in ok so these are more sort of static

709
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,860
things to do it today ok here we go so

710
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,450
here's that that you I mechanism of us

711
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,440
talking about where you can sort of

712
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,680
define a hunk of you I without actually

713
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,780
instantiating it until you need it so

714
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,600
there's a thing called Joe cash and you

715
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,350
can set basically you give it some sort

716
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,770
of name string and you give it a handler

717
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,780
function that gets called

718
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,200
the first time that this particular hunk

719
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,470
of you I is requested with the geocache

720
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:37,150
get and then the stores are respond to

721
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,190
that so any subsequent calls to it it'll

722
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,820
just return whatever whatever reached

723
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,110
her was returned from the first call

724
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,900
does that make sense nobody raised their

725
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:52,169
hand ok so I'll show you real quick

726
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:56,860
here's a couple more Joe kashish set so

727
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:06,100
whenever whenever you Joe cash get okay

728
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,790
I get text area so we can use something

729
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,690
well look it's about that typo so

730
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,770
something like if we have our Rui stack

731
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:21,340
we can push this on to it and what

732
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,980
that'll do is since we designed this

733
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,060
thing down below text area the first

734
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,860
time that this gets called the stack

735
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,500
push Joe cash get it's going to go look

736
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,770
up our property for text area and it's

737
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,930
going to say well I haven't this isn't a

738
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,010
call before so i'm going to call this

739
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,280
function and the function all the does

740
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,840
is return some sort of UI widget in this

741
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,690
case we're returning card another thing

742
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,120
to note 2 i'm just going back into the

743
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,370
hole you know Joe isn't trying to get in

744
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:57,390
between you and and getting the job done

745
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,890
the common unit of currency that you'll

746
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,200
see being thrown around with all this UI

747
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,930
stuff are basically Joe widgets and Joe

748
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,710
views they can just as easily be HTML

749
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,500
pieces so you can you can feed it a dumb

750
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,410
node directly and it'll sort of roll

751
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,790
with that as well so if you have some

752
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,680
sort of thing that doesn't really match

753
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,940
any sort of control that's something

754
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,130
that you sort of created on your own you

755
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,170
can feed that in as well and it'll it'll

756
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,420
handle it it would resolve all that for

757
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,120
you

758
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,769
so a little more stuff here but again

759
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:33,000
you can see more of that that's sort of

760
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,609
a inline sugar for for creating these

761
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:40,890
things now you see this type of

762
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,259
structure in things like sent to touch

763
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:49,200
but what they do is sort of create sort

764
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,819
of a JSON blob with a lot of properties

765
00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:54,059
and some string flags and things like

766
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:57,720
that in there I kind of like I like the

767
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,339
structure but I prefer to be closer to

768
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:02,309
the middle so if you notice we sort of

769
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:04,529
have that the nested structure but we're

770
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:06,599
actually creating these objects on the

771
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,769
fly so we're still actually coding in

772
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,079
java script we're not pushing it through

773
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,089
some sort of framework and in fact if

774
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:16,470
you wanted to code this up without

775
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,640
putting it in the sort of hierarchy

776
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,829
network it's perfectly fine you can

777
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:21,420
create each of each of these pieces and

778
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,609
then you know inject them in whatever

779
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:31,140
fashion suits your coding style cool

780
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:36,509
this is the remote thing okay all right

781
00:37:36,509 --> 00:37:40,289
make sense so far I saw two people nod

782
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:58,880
ok cool ok so

783
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,019
so let's take a look at a quick sample

784
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:03,960
app that does a little bit more than

785
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:23,920
these are these little prototype things

786
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,840
mmm see again in some more applause for

787
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,880
the Wi-Fi that worked beautifully that's

788
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,220
what the sample app does is it looks up

789
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,810
all the traffic incidents that are that

790
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,080
are centered around a particular area in

791
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,340
this particular case we're looking for

792
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,840
anything it's with it within 100 miles

793
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,390
of say New York City because we want a

794
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,910
nice decently sized list to to scroll

795
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,610
through and when you tap on one of them

796
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,810
you get sort of this detailed view in

797
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,310
this case we're pulling down a view from

798
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:52,520
google maps if you click on that and

799
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,340
actually pulls up the google maps page

800
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,460
itself not as impressive on the browser

801
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,620
so in here you're a mobile app it'll

802
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,570
actually typically able to launch the if

803
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,980
you have a map application that will

804
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:13,790
launch that map app all right a little

805
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:18,530
more stuff here if you notice we've got

806
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,140
so you can manually refresh it all out

807
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,660
of there kept it good stuff so the same

808
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,900
app and I have I don't want to go

809
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,220
through all the different platforms but

810
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,290
basically you can take the same map and

811
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,100
run it in a dozen different places and

812
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,390
by places I mean different sorts of

813
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,860
platforms including a few that you

814
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,200
wouldn't expect so after the talk

815
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,270
sometime later today if you go to Joe

816
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,250
app calm and i'll have that roll up at

817
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,020
the end i have like a 10 minute video

818
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,510
that does sort of a demo of the same app

819
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,720
pretty much the same app running on

820
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,390
about eight different things and again

821
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,100
the same code underneath so sort of

822
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,830
right once well i won't say write once

823
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,300
run everywhere i'll say right once in

824
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,940
debug everywhere each platform has like

825
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,350
a little some eccentricities one of the

826
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,060
design goals with Joe is to limit most

827
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,450
of those eccentricities on the CSS level

828
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,740
and it's been largely successful with

829
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:19,790
that so let's take the same app

830
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:27,340
alright so this is a the same app and

831
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,230
I've got folder setup for running the

832
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,100
browser for android dashboard widgets

833
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,740
will show in a second running on iphone

834
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,210
ipad mobile safari this is slight tweak

835
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,680
in the index HTML for that and then

836
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,020
webOS and I happen to have the emulator

837
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,750
up for webos which is of course my

838
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,610
absolute favorite mobile platform

839
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:55,090
disclosure i work for HP but i was

840
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,530
actually a huge fan before i started so

841
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:01,270
i feel fair and honest in saying that ok

842
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,670
cool so we have a simulator running a

843
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:14,920
webos 20

844
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:21,740
alright so we package it these are some

845
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,819
command line tools for getting apps

846
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:27,230
basically built builds the app package

847
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,970
and then installs it on the device or

848
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,819
the emulator here we go these are

849
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:44,240
commuter up so again same app running on

850
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,550
two different platforms Joe also does

851
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:51,339
some other things to some platforms will

852
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:53,630
require a back button others won't for

853
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,460
example webOS as a web loss to anyway

854
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,040
has a back gesture on the device which

855
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,750
so you notice it won't actually put it

856
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,069
back button and will maybe show another

857
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:12,390
example of that in a minute

858
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:22,410
ok

859
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,099
actually how much time do I have left

860
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:31,270
I'm about done I'm about done so um let

861
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:39,240
me go back or a quick okay Q&A session

862
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,020
so any questions why on earth would I do

863
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:49,089
this um that sort of thing yes up here

864
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:50,799
questions have again it worked with

865
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:53,410
backbone I have not played with it I I

866
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,180
don't see why it wouldn't work with it

867
00:42:55,180 --> 00:43:00,460
so and I think somebody over at night

868
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,680
Toby was talking about playing with that

869
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,290
so somebody somewhere has it working

870
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,069
with backbone just not me yet any other

871
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:12,640
questions Oh what about any oh yeah so

872
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,490
any oh is a really cool framework that

873
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,790
HP's put out Mac McNulty's team is

874
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,329
putting that together at over at HP Enyo

875
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:26,049
is really designed for i want to say

876
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:28,450
larger more enterprise type apps that's

877
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,599
a very comprehensive framework and it

878
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,280
has all the pluses and minuses that you

879
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,369
get with a larger framework like that

880
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:38,710
generally if you're doing larger apps

881
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,290
you would probably want a larger

882
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,150
framework to get the job done there's

883
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,059
some conceptual similarities and yo the

884
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:48,220
same thing as joe you know you start

885
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,609
with an empty index HTML and JavaScript

886
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:56,440
pre all the stuff okay so that this is

887
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,210
actually yeah so the question is is uh

888
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,170
any 0 vs vs really you're talking mojo

889
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,180
for those for those that started with

890
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,220
webos when it first came out there's a

891
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,770
framework called mojo please do not

892
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,859
confuse Joe with mojo in any shape form

893
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:15,190
at all mojo is something that we're

894
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,710
trying to move away from at HP you know

895
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,910
we really appreciate the developers that

896
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,970
started working with it but any o is our

897
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,980
official framework than it's a heck of a

898
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,740
lot better but yeah it was as far as Joe

899
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,900
versus n yo Joseph's lighter weight and

900
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,460
it's it's geared I think more for

901
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,079
different types of apps and different

902
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,400
types of coders any others

903
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,840
anymore anymore okay cool I think I am
