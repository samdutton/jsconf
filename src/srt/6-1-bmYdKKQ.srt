00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:13,650

i well we have a confession to make

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,420
where hackers for thieves for criminals

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,080
we've been stealing code for years in

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,840
order to protect our identity I'm sorry

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,079
Todd but I'm sorry but this is way too

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,410
hot well I said we have to protect I

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,430
mean it's crazy hard to say it and

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,070
forget it she Minds fine we have to

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,260
protect our identity did yours itchy no

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,079
oh can we trade no oh well can I take

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,480
mine off no we have to sector identities

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,660
but I'm sorry I gotta take this off it's

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:01:01,120
killing me is a lot better now everybody

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,210
knows who we are then we steal code well

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,290
so everybody does it no no they don't

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,790
otherwise everybody in this room

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,190
everybody in our community we'd all be

18
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,920
wearing masks oh yeah they kind of do

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,260
steal code github isn't stealing code of

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,700
course it is you browse into somebody's

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,590
code you look at how they did it then

22
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,180
maybe you take it and write it yourself

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,390
or worse yet you cut and paste it well

24
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,850
sure but well how about this I bet every

25
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,650
single person in this room has gotten to

26
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,350
this site copied some snippet of code

27
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,960
and paste it into your project that's

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,910
not stealing code it's the entire point

29
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,010
of stack overflow really because they're

30
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,560
copyright policy specifically says they

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,820
own everything oh except not every site

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,180
is stack overflow how about jeaious bins

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,490
policy if you put it out there it's free

34
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,700
to use I see remedy in the back he's the

35
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,480
one that created it

36
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,860
yeah it's open tools like these that

37
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,050
make it possible for sharing so sure

38
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,150
jazz Ben is super awesome we're all

39
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,099
thankful for it but the majority of

40
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,099
other sites out there so you're saying

41
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,140
we're all criminals not just that but

42
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,410
we've been doing it for years that's

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,130
that's some serious traffic was it 19

44
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,620
billion global views in six years a lot

45
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,330
of stealing that's it's years and years

46
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,100
of stealing sure people we know people

47
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,569
in this very room admitted to stealing

48
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,739
code even some of the speakers you're

49
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:44,870
going to hear this weekend like Rachel

50
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,610
and Remy and Pam even one of the

51
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,290
founders of NPM admit to stealing code

52
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,850
we've all been stealing code for years

53
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,480
decades even really decades sure before

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,150
get up there was sourceforge all right

55
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,799
right I before that we would go into the

56
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:03,590
forums right you guys remember digging

57
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,060
through all the PHP forums just to

58
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,940
figure out how to write a blog well sure

59
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,230
except picked yeah PHP completely sucks

60
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,459
come on man so what were you doing

61
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,940
before you troll the forums um well i

62
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,820
first learned java script using view

63
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,859
source in the 90s all right view source

64
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:27,350
let's that's great what was the last

65
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,940
time you needed that I mean browser dev

66
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,430
tools today are amazing well even before

67
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,350
that we had all these these magazines

68
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,450
with code in them right so you would

69
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,819
open the magazine sit down and then like

70
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,829
type the code from the magazine into

71
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,930
your computer but that's that's not

72
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,910
stealing oh I was just using those

73
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,010
magazines to figure out how how to do it

74
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,260
well it still sounds fundamentally like

75
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,920
a cut-and-paste job well how did you

76
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,750
start programming well I started on one

77
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,630
of these sweet Commodore pets

78
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,760
but how did you start programming it

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,160
well I just leaned over to the kid next

80
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,830
to me and asked him what up today and he

81
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,390
showed you what well he showed me his

82
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,920
coat and you copied it well we didn't

83
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,760
have cut and paste back then but you

84
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,670
typed it in well yeah he told me what

85
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,330
the time thus you stole his code but

86
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,730
what did you do next well I started

87
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,080
changing things I started trying things

88
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,690
out you made it your own exactly instead

89
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,580
of an asterisk chasing a pound side I

90
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,690
made it chase a dog so you took his idea

91
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,940
and you subverted it in your own manner

92
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,130
well but does it be active changing

93
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,430
something make it mine and not his like

94
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:50,330
I guess I I don't think you could

95
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,130
copyright an idea after all you just

96
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,040
copy write the expression of the idea so

97
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,080
you're telling me we're not criminals I

98
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,220
think so you're suggesting that the act

99
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,350
of changing what we steal makes it legit

100
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,450
well I think it's a little more

101
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,640
complicated than that you know while

102
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,660
you're though well but what about the

103
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,230
what about the fair use clause well what

104
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,700
about when your client comes to you and

105
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,590
they say they want a parallax site and

106
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,790
you've never even heard what a parallax

107
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,400
site is does the research aspect come

108
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,810
into play when you cut and paste from

109
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,300
stack overflow well again I'm not a

110
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,910
lawyer no no you're not but I do think

111
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,960
there's a good kind of code stealing

112
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,420
good stealing sure otherwise all these

113
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,940
people are in a lot of trouble so how do

114
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,560
you know what is good stealing and what

115
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,840
is bad stealing oh I think it comes down

116
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,460
to intent intent sure why are you

117
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,620
stealing the code is it to take money

118
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,180
away from the copyright owner or are you

119
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,800
just trying to finish the customer's

120
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,150
request so you can go home to your wife

121
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,040
and kids or are you just trying to learn

122
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,670
how to do it for yourself so you think

123
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,830
it's okay if our intent is to learn

124
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,890
right it has to be again otherwise the

125
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,690
whole industry is in trouble how's that

126
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,210
well think back to your days using view

127
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,160
source copying the code

128
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,980
code that you saw there well I didn't

129
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,770
copy it per se of course you did but you

130
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,320
changed it right well yeah I wanted to

131
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,310
see how it worked and then you change

132
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,220
this some more sure and so on your

133
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,620
learning through the change yeah that's

134
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,510
how I work right well that's my point we

135
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,820
have an entire industry of canker it's

136
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,090
baked into what we do okay I see we

137
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,980
steal the code to learn and then we

138
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,610
learn by tinkering right well my

139
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,810
daughter does the exact same thing

140
00:06:41,810 --> 00:07:01,670
really watch this she's pretty cute this

141
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,500
is true but my point is that she's

142
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,960
learning by exploring she's trying new

143
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,870
things she's gaining experienced or

144
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,730
experimentation or as they say in this

145
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,710
slide here the bottom two lines the

146
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,810
practice by doing and immediate use

147
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,790
right actually when you think about it

148
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,320
it's the primary way that people learned

149
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,540
we replicate we change we observe and

150
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,450
then we understand the except when we

151
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,250
fail no well failing as part of the

152
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,190
process well fail often fail fast and

153
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,560
learn always the goal of experimentation

154
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,860
whether successful or not is

155
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,200
understanding so I steal code but in a

156
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,270
good way to experiment on it and

157
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,730
ultimately gain new understanding and

158
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,360
then build on that build on that sure

159
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
once you understand something you can

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,690
use it to understand the next thing up

161
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,690
the chain the bigger understanding but

162
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,000
if that's how we learn why did I spend

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,320
all those years or more importantly all

164
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,280
that money doing this okay you bring up

165
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,280
a great point me I did the other

166
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,560
approach is rote learning where the

167
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
understanding is dictated to you and

168
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,669
you're supposed to accept it as fact

169
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,880
well but again as we see here the

170
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,289
retention rate from lecture based

171
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,780
learning is really really low well

172
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,700
exactly there's no chance to explore

173
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,540
what you learned

174
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,360
it's all memorization but you're working

175
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,070
from the top down lectures reading

176
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,040
presentations there isn't a chance to do

177
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,520
anything right it's a different tactic

178
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,050
they give you the understanding and then

179
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,970
they let you figure out how to prove it

180
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,820
but the stealing way you're figuring out

181
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,470
how something works and then you can't

182
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,950
understanding yes so that's great news

183
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,670
because school sucks okay I'm not saying

184
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,520
that there's a place for both well

185
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,110
except the bottom-up approach is more

186
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,240
how we work we've already admitted to

187
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,370
all these people that were stealing code

188
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,080
and tinkering on it well maybe that's

189
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,400
the problem with how we're teaching our

190
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,380
next generation so too much

191
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,100
book-learning not enough experimentation

192
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,390
it's almost too rigid we end up with

193
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,490
college graduates who don't understand

194
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,320
the why the things why things work the

195
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,540
way they do they often lack the tools to

196
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,660
figure it out so how do they get those

197
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,730
tools how does a person that's been

198
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,100
shorted the ability to tinker learn to

199
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,130
take her how do we teach people to steal

200
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,310
it a good way well it's a really

201
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,170
interesting topic but for now we're

202
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,060
going to take a little detour alright

203
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,510
lets out this is the Mona Lisa oh it's

204
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,790
by DaVinci right but do you know how to

205
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,920
Vinci learn to paint I'm very sure that

206
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,130
he didn't take cs3 11 exactly he was an

207
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,060
apprentice to a painter and sculptor

208
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,570
Andrea del Verrocchio he taught DaVinci

209
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,010
all sorts of things like metallurgy

210
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,380
sculpting and painting in fact they

211
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,370
painted this together it said that when

212
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,830
they finished Verrocchio was so taken

213
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,570
away by da Vinci's work that he put down

214
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,760
his paintbrush never to paint again well

215
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,710
that's great but what does it have to do

216
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,750
with stealing code my point is that in

217
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,270
the old visit olden days disciplines

218
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,490
were taught through apprenticeship da

219
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,080
Vinci was an apprentice to Pharrell geo

220
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,990
and in turn apprentice some of his own

221
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,140
even including Raphael who painted this

222
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,430
oh those look really similar right an

223
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,500
apprentice learns to the process of

224
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,080
mimicking his masters technique okay but

225
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,330
we're not in the older days anymore it's

226
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,930
all about educating its scale how we're

227
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,130
mass communicated

228
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,350
but for our field like da Vinci's maybe

229
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,640
it's better for us to get our hands

230
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,270
dirty well now you lost me the goal of

231
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,370
an apprenticeship is to learn how your

232
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,560
master does things but you start small

233
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,870
doing the little work your master and

234
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,420
oil no longer has time to do oh right

235
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,150
the Scott work like writing tests right

236
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,280
but over time you row to do more and

237
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,650
more evolved work build all on all that

238
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,750
scut work you did initially so what

239
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,250
you're saying is maybe we need to teach

240
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,900
computer programming like we're teaching

241
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,890
art in an art class you get the theory

242
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,480
in history but ultimately you're

243
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,400
exploring your ideas from day one in

244
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,670
your studio work and well most CS

245
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,980
classes are theory and formulas but you

246
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,910
really don't get a chance to explore

247
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,610
until your senior level stuff possibly

248
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,100
even grad school so what you're saying

249
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,540
sounds like it really comes down to

250
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,920
where the opportunity to create lies

251
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,560
exactly art classes have you creating

252
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,930
from day one but CS classes don't have

253
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,540
you creating until the end so what we

254
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,710
just said that we steal code to

255
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,780
understand it to take it apart to make

256
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,850
it our own doesn't that sound more like

257
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,460
the art class example then the CS class

258
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,290
example all right yeah kinda and

259
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,420
actually the apprenticeship paradigm

260
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,310
isn't just about art lots of other

261
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,370
fields use it like music I mean the

262
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,710
voice is basically a show about landing

263
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,740
an apprenticeship and in architecture

264
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,380
and design Walter Gropius who was the

265
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,350
founder of the Bauhaus School said the

266
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,450
best kind of practical teaching is the

267
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,550
old system of free apprenticeship to a

268
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,980
master craftsman which was void of any

269
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,300
scholastic tape and even in physics

270
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,350
Einstein said the only source of

271
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,040
knowledge is experience taught oh sorry

272
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,120
let's get back on topic oh right I was

273
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,680
going to say that while you while I

274
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,480
agree with you we don't really do

275
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,770
apprenticeships anymore they went out

276
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,360
with the Industrial Revolution let's say

277
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,080
50 100 150 years ago well yes and no no

278
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,610
what we have apprentices now we just

279
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,290
call them entry-level developers or

280
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,830
interns that's that's that's where you

281
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,300
learn that almost everything they just

282
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,130
taught you in college is worthless

283
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,020
yeah that's that's pretty unfortunate

284
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,080
but wouldn't it be better of entry-level

285
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,940
devs started with the knowledge they

286
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,460
really need to know to do their job like

287
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,470
how to Google stack overflow for answers

288
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,090
well actually yes points for Glen

289
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,060
remember when we said we were stealing

290
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,240
code to tinker so that we can learn well

291
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,360
it's our topic okay right what wouldn't

292
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,770
it be great if the entry-level dev

293
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,930
showed up on day one and knew how to do

294
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,870
that yeah but I don't think that's about

295
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,420
to change anytime soon I know it's not

296
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,270
so maybe it's on us to teach the new

297
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,900
employees yeah so what are the ways that

298
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,460
we do that no well there's there's pair

299
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,130
programming sure pairing is a learning

300
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,960
technique this perfect example for this

301
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,420
it's codes dealing with a friend

302
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,890
in a good in a good pair one person's

303
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,000
writing the code while the other is

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,160
constantly copying stuff off a stack

305
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,950
overflow okay let's not get really

306
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,110
carried away here but but you do get

307
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,850
what I'm saying right right one person

308
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,230
is hands on the keyboard the other

309
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,580
person is thinking the bigger thoughts

310
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,800
well but I feel with pair program it's

311
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,020
really easy to begin nit picking on each

312
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,690
other oh it's not a perfect system oh

313
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,430
and speaking of nitpicking what about a

314
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,850
code reviews yes it's another way to

315
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,350
teach when it's done right I've been on

316
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,030
far too many code reviews well people

317
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,940
will use it as a way to show superiority

318
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,460
that's unfortunate if you lay out some

319
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,620
sensible ground rules a code review can

320
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,420
be an incredibly powerful teaching tool

321
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,430
so I guess that's then it's about it

322
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,050
comes down to the personalities and

323
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,290
their adherence to the rules yeah so

324
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,110
what else do we do with new developers

325
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,700
to help them learn the lay of the land

326
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,690
well you can use your workflow to teach

327
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,790
how do you mean like teaching a pull

328
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,760
request workflow for code reviews yeah

329
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,190
I'm still not following okay you use

330
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,140
your workflow process to automate things

331
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,590
to encourage conversation with a pull

332
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,880
request you can assign it to a specific

333
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,580
person to get their feedback provides

334
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,950
you with the initial opportunity to

335
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,530
start a teaching moment so instead of

336
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,000
leaving your people out there on their

337
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,980
own you're usually the process to

338
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,200
encourage communication exactly it's

339
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,390
especially useful for a newer person to

340
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,830
assign a pull request to someone more

341
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,690
knowledgeable oh so they're actively

342
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,330
asking for learn to learn by creating a

343
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,150
conversation but about what you're doing

344
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,460
okay but I feel like that becomes really

345
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,910
dependent on the process well yeah a

346
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,490
good process is everything it really all

347
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,430
depends on your company having a culture

348
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,280
of learning the process that fosters

349
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,800
learning okay but that that has to come

350
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,430
from the top the management has to

351
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,670
create and nurture a great culture well

352
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,410
so I would argue that the first person

353
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,630
in a company to help new people needs to

354
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,520
be the managers they need to be very

355
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,320
active in making sure the new hires

356
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,850
don't just learn the best way to code

357
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,630
but they learn the best way to

358
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,240
well it's an interesting argument but I

359
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,120
think a lot of managers would disagree

360
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,000
they're always too busy if they didn't

361
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,820
want to manage people maybe they should

362
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:20,470
it be managers well I'm a manager do you

363
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,380
manage people I do so do you practice

364
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,089
what you preach well I'm a firm believer

365
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:27,389
in being in the trenches so to speak

366
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:29,829
rolling up my sleeves working with my

367
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:33,699
employees working side by side so that's

368
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:35,170
another way that we mentor on the job

369
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,350
through a nurturing environment sure and

370
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,240
by actively participating I'm not just

371
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,560
helping the new person that public

372
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,240
myself but more importantly I'm helping

373
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,060
the keep your helping the culture

374
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,440
through mentoring precisely and it goes

375
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,990
beyond the workplace okay it does sure I

376
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,779
also mentor outside work okay now we're

377
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,639
getting somewhere tell us all about it

378
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,519
right so I work with Baltimore node

379
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,470
school and help others learn JavaScript

380
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,850
no diva the fundamentals of program

381
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,770
actually there is a node school event

382
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,419
running right this very second that I'm

383
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:10,120
missing to be here with all of you we do

384
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,299
have a pool and the beach but I'm really

385
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,309
sorry that you're missing it no school

386
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,470
sounds awesome I enjoy it and more

387
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,240
importantly it's getting us back to the

388
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,069
subject at hand of how we can give

389
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,839
people who haven't had the chance to

390
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,419
learn to steal code the skills to learn

391
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,089
to steal code all right can we agree to

392
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,090
stop calling the stealing code what do

393
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:38,169
you want to call it tinkering hijacking

394
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:45,280
pass um creative borrowing all right all

395
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,049
right I like it it's teaching people how

396
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:50,320
to creatively borrow okay how so well

397
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,970
known school works by asking you to

398
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,950
solve a problem and give you vague ideas

399
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,809
of where to find help to solve that

400
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,580
problem live events take it a step

401
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,110
further by pairing people together

402
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,410
encouraging them to learn together well

403
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,880
this sounds perfect for what we're

404
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,190
talking about well absolutely but let's

405
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,809
not spend a lot of time on it how about

406
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,600
some other programs do you know any

407
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,299
um no you hear about all these hack days

408
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,610
and training things let's get more

409
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,950
specific okay uh hack reactor hack

410
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,570
reactor is an interesting example but

411
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,700
it's one you pay for let's let's focus

412
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,010
on some free ones alright I work with a

413
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,980
lot of rails devs they tell me about

414
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,750
railsbridge it's the rails version in

415
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,370
that's cool okay I was in a coffee shop

416
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,559
the other day and a guy told me about

417
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,350
hacker hours so this is really

418
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,730
interesting it's where you show up you

419
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,590
code you throw up your hand if you have

420
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,260
a question the organizers will give you

421
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,120
some help even if they don't know the

422
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,700
language they'll find a way to get you

423
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,140
help a source for your creative

424
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,090
borrowing they're literally teaching you

425
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,520
how to tinker at its basis form that's

426
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,960
pretty sweet i especially like that

427
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,140
their date is an epic time so what else

428
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,110
you got for us okay there's also the

429
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,480
women who code this is a national

430
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,159
organization they host events all over

431
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,159
the place all the time helping women get

432
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:15,309
into tinkering cool but you notice what

433
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:17,950
you've done here what did i do well

434
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,150
you've moved from talking about

435
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,690
mentoring to talking about communities

436
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,309
interesting well maybe that's the answer

437
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,309
to the question through community well

438
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:32,770
communities that mentor communities that

439
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,450
nurture new people specifically well

440
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,390
like lemon code Oh notes cool and hacker

441
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,890
hours and a dozen different

442
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,440
organizations well this year at ember

443
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,659
comp they started women helping women

444
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:45,909
this is specifically a mentorship

445
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,070
program for women in tech not just for

446
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,950
coding and code reviews but for

447
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,419
leadership and getting people to speak

448
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:55,870
and for blogs there's also global day of

449
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,630
code retreat and this is starting with a

450
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,549
specific problem conway's game of life

451
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:03,309
and you show up and you hack on whatever

452
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:04,929
language you want you get help and

453
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,880
people pair and and switch off all day

454
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,210
long there's also international node bad

455
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,190
day I mean I actually learned about this

456
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,980
at the last J has come um I mean I'm

457
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,320
sure a ton of people here do robots and

458
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,390
love JavaScript so it's a full day of

459
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,820
that oh my company big nerd ranch

460
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,600
gratuitous plug we host a number of hack

461
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,880
nights and we have we're working in

462
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,570
languages like Android and iOS front end

463
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,690
in JavaScript and we do a lot of

464
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,759
hardware stuff and design but its

465
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,289
communities like these that make it

466
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:41,029
possible for everybody to get involved

467
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,549
and that's the important thing well but

468
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,080
it's more than just teaching people how

469
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,110
to borrow creatively yeah sure it's

470
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,519
about teaching people how to see from

471
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,950
different points of view as well okay

472
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,809
now I'm not following you okay well

473
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,399
consider our initial problem I going to

474
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:58,070
stack overflow or wherever and cut and

475
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,379
paste some code right yeah borrow it

476
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:04,549
creatively sure but then I changed thus

477
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:06,110
preventing you from doing any hard time

478
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,500
right but how do I know to change it

479
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,080
well it's code it's the nature of it

480
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,809
sure right but if I only ever knew about

481
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:18,440
one thing say oranges for example how

482
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,370
could I ever imagined a banana okay

483
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,990
you're talking about our ability to see

484
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,570
beyond what we already know about using

485
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,090
our imagination well partially but I'm

486
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,730
also talking about a thing called them

487
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,559
integral philosophy right where our

488
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,149
understanding of all that comes before

489
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:38,389
helps us build what comes after so

490
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:39,980
imagining a banana is only possible

491
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,460
because you know about oranges right and

492
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,379
the next step beyond that is only

493
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:47,000
possible because you know about oranges

494
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,309
and bananas it's cumulative well it's

495
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,480
comprehensive it's integrated exactly

496
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,220
but how does that apply to communities

497
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,320
well the more we consider a different

498
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,879
points of view and the more we let

499
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:00,889
different voices into our community the

500
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:03,200
greater our ability to comprehend that

501
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,720
which the way greater our ability to

502
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,580
comprehend stuff beyond what we know

503
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,620
that's what these communities are doing

504
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,330
women who code notes cool they give us a

505
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,860
chance to participate in the community

506
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,259
out ideas the diversity of human

507
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,629
experience and teach not just how to

508
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,820
really tinker but to also understand

509
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,710
well understand code well in people so

510
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,649
is that it we admit to being thieves but

511
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:29,269
we're all fees and we're all created

512
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:32,389
borrowers and that's not a bad thing

513
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:33,830
that's a good thing because

514
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,269
that's how we work well there's just one

515
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:42,890
more thing yeah well it's all yours well

516
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,419
it's on us to make sure that the people

517
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:46,760
coming into this field the newbies if

518
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,649
you will have the ability and the

519
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:51,529
opportunity to learn that to understand

520
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:53,720
it to use it to build something better

521
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,450
by which you mean well community is

522
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,820
great but it has to start somewhere it

523
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,000
has to be led by someone so it'd be

524
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,470
great if we were at some sort of I don't

525
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,960
know let's call it a conference where we

526
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:14,799
could tell a bunch people this so yeah

527
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,419
all you sitting out there we're trying

528
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,159
to tell you that being a great developer

529
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:21,710
isn't just about knowing how to tinker

530
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,200
or knowing how to creatively borrow from

531
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,269
Stack Overflow being a great developer

532
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:28,159
is about being willing to help others

533
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,409
learn to be great developers to learn to

534
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,649
tinker and to grow and to understand

535
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:35,029
we're trying to tell you that just

536
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:36,679
watching a community from the sidelines

537
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:39,409
is it enough you need to get out there

538
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:42,970
be part of it nurture it grow it lead it

539
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,149
and that brings us to this moment now

540
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:49,159
right now right this second you've

541
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,470
already begun the process I'm willing

542
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,389
bet that the person sitting next to you

543
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:58,240
knows something that you don't

544
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,420
actually that that's a really great

545
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,800
point Oh points4 glad all these people

546
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,260
all these days conf attendees they've
