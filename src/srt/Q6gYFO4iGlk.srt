00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,840

I was very that was very nice thank you

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,939
very much I've never been whistle

00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:22,189
introduced all right flight please does

4
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:27,980
that look correct alrighty good hi

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,550
everyone my name is Giani net I'm a

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,620
JavaScript developer from Berlin and I'd

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,239
like to thank the J's conf Iceland

8
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,850
organizes that they invited me to close

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,100
their very fine conference it is an

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,129
honor the title of this talk is the

11
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:47,179
state of the JavaScript community when

12
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:48,530
you look at the topics that were

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,269
presented just here at this event you

14
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:52,429
will quickly see that there's not one

15
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,800
JavaScript conference but many at sorry

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,929
community not one JavaScript community

17
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:59,899
but many JavaScript communities we might

18
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,550
write code in the same language but our

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,800
interests are web internet of things

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,200
virtual reality and plenty of subgroups

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,090
as well front and back and robots

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,120
bicycles and and add our community is

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,520
really a set of communities and that's a

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,770
good thing the more communities we have

25
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,360
in JavaScript the more interesting

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,670
people we have joining and the these new

27
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,410
people are finding new problems to solve

28
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,030
in JavaScript and then they will find

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,070
even more solutions to these problems in

30
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,780
JavaScript and then other JavaScript

31
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,520
communities can take these solutions and

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,800
apply them to their field for example

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,530
jQuery a phenomenally successful project

34
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,770
has a hazard its core a feature making

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,240
the dome of vile beast of browser

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,580
programming more accessible to a lot

37
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,620
more people to the point where people

38
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,270
were more jquery developers than

39
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,740
JavaScript developers it was that

40
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,140
successful for still is when Rick

41
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,670
Waldron wanted to get people to use

42
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,620
JavaScript to control robots he created

43
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,240
the library or the library johnny-five

44
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,490
and aside from a great name he stole the

45
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,590
idea from jQuery that making the complex

46
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,120
world of hardware more accessible to

47
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,550
more people will lead to success and it

48
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,850
worked this cross-pollination of ideas

49
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,460
happens all the time and it's fantastic

50
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,800
I'm very happy the JavaScript community

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,140
is so diverse in topics as far as

52
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,840
overused aphorisms go software is eating

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,240
the world is as good as any now in

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,500
JavaScript that's already know in

55
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,829
software javascript is every

56
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,120
it's used for everything and most

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,159
developers that do something else also

58
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,900
do at least a little bit of JavaScript

59
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,209
by any measure javascript is the biggest

60
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,069
most successful programming language of

61
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:36,920
our time or even all time so when

62
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,239
software's eating the world and

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,189
javascript is eating software so

64
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:43,879
javascript is eating the world that's

65
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,939
not good thesis here a better world we

66
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:49,129
as a set of JavaScript communities have

67
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,019
a significant impact on the world we

68
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,140
shape its future this is why now more

69
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,819
than ever it is important to look at our

70
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,220
culture because our culture informs who

71
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,230
we are and where we are going and who

72
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,209
are we taking who we are taking along

73
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:10,549
for the ride today the JavaScript

74
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:12,950
community and the culture is me straight

75
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,170
white male upper middle class Westerner

76
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,730
with all the privilege in the world and

77
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,150
that's great for me and everyone who

78
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,269
looks like me but most of the people on

79
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,370
this planet do not look like me and if

80
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,629
we were building a future for everyone

81
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:28,639
we need to have representatives of

82
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,069
everyone participate in our making of

83
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,709
that future they need to be part of our

84
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,889
culture or design and business decisions

85
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:38,090
building software is an act of

86
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,879
representation just one chilling example

87
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,919
when Facebook change this default

88
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,079
privacy setting for group memberships to

89
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,000
public a queer person from an area that

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,129
is traditionally not as open-minded got

91
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,260
the membership in a queer choir revealed

92
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,269
revealed to their parents putting that

93
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,790
person at significant personal risk if

94
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,229
Facebook's product managers and

95
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:59,239
designers or developers will include

96
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,190
more queer people this product design

97
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,659
decision would have known would have not

98
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,079
gone through most software's design and

99
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,879
build without any understanding of a

100
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,590
circumstance of the majority of the

101
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,109
people that end up using that software

102
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:13,940
and the results are increasingly

103
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,010
terrible I just need to point at

104
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,690
Twitter's rampant abuse problem in the

105
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,190
cultural inability to deal with this

106
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,409
it's not that they can't solve this they

107
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:23,570
don't want to at most of us are kind of

108
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,530
okay with that in his book creativity

109
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,539
ink at Catmull the founder of pixar

110
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,430
reveals one of the cornerstones of

111
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,029
pixels continued success success heights

112
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:37,900
failure and success makes

113
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,780
in short true long-term sustainability

114
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,000
comes from introspecting ones failures

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,310
and staying vigilant about one's works

116
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,920
downsides especially especially in the

117
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,740
face of massive success there is no

118
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,450
argument to be lost that javascript is

119
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,730
successful so let's introspect our

120
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,320
culture and let's be vigilant about our

121
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,720
work discussing this whole topic

122
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,550
comprehensively would probably take a

123
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,650
couple of days so I'm just picking a few

124
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,210
things so we can get this discussion

125
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,350
started one of the cornerstones of our

126
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,180
community is open source most of the

127
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,980
software we use dailies open source or

128
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,420
build an open source and most of our

129
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,160
tooling as developers is also open

130
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,380
source and as someone who has deep roots

131
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,540
in an open open source this is fantastic

132
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,880
this is the kind of world I want to live

133
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,440
in what do I in the past few months

134
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,210
three major JavaScript projects

135
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,680
announced that the one person that was

136
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,210
left maintaining them is leaving and the

137
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,950
project would be abandoned more or less

138
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,380
what happens is this somebody published

139
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,630
something useful in github and NPM and a

140
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,220
ton of people start using and relying on

141
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,920
it eventually the support burden and

142
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,110
user questions issue reports pull

143
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,240
requests and so on overwhelmed the

144
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,830
individual and they get overworked or

145
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,860
worse burned out we had a show of hands

146
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,510
about burnout in the opening talk by

147
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,730
miles yesterday and a no fair number of

148
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,860
you have experience with this my hand

149
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,930
certainly went up and I hope we can

150
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,460
avoid for the rest of you to ever have

151
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,800
to deal with this by the way three

152
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,930
projects were grunt power and uglify

153
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,330
that millions of people depended on it

154
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,430
is obvious that our culture doesn't

155
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,230
include a way to make open source

156
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,890
projects sustainable and it puts our

157
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,150
infrastructure at risk and it more

158
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,500
importantly it puts the people in our

159
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,410
community at risk there are many many

160
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,000
things that we can do to improve this

161
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,860
there are many many problems that we

162
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,100
need to be improving but I was recently

163
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,380
on a podcast called request for commits

164
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,810
that's a new thing that came out because

165
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,100
I had blocked about this topic last

166
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,220
winter and I don't have time to go into

167
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,080
all the things to cover all the things

168
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,920
but if you're interested in that

169
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,750
specific part like please come up to me

170
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,300
later and we can talk about this if

171
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,920
there's one thing I want to pick one

172
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,210
thing that we can be doing to improve

173
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,950
this and like if we can get the scouring

174
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,600
this will be really good

175
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,550
when reporting issues to package

176
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,150
maintain errs be nice I understand that

177
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,130
it is very very frustrating to spend

178
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,260
hours or days to find out that the small

179
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,090
mistake in a dependent they're like very

180
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,590
deep down in their dependency tree

181
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,450
causes you grief but letting that

182
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,770
frustration out on the package

183
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,680
maintainer has terrible consequences one

184
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,440
your incentive of course is to get the

185
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,420
issue fixed the number one thing you can

186
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,460
do to make sure somebody is absolutely

187
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,410
not inclined to work for you for free is

188
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,440
yelling at them and calling them names I

189
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,670
know most of you are clever enough to

190
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,250
understand that and understand this and

191
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,010
mature enough to not behave that way the

192
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,350
second terrible consequence is that

193
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,940
you're very likely not the only one

194
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,250
doing this not you specifically you know

195
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,830
what I mean and even if one abusive

196
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,140
issue might not cause any problems for a

197
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,760
maintainer which is already unlikely

198
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,280
getting one every week or one every day

199
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,930
elevates the maintain is personal

200
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,990
frustration to a constant stream of

201
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,730
so-called microaggressions and these

202
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,430
drain their emotional resources most

203
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,080
people leave open source because of

204
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,060
because of the abuse of their emotional

205
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,420
labor women and under sorry women and

206
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,250
other underrepresented groups ee or

207
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,810
triply sir because they don't only have

208
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,640
to deal with this but have the technical

209
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,060
abilities questions non-stop as well

210
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,380
like I said before there are a lot of

211
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,780
things that we can be doing but everyone

212
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,000
here should start not should start not

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,010
being an asshole on github and also help

214
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,630
out to create a culture of no tolerance

215
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,030
for assholes in JavaScript when we do

216
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,440
that we will be significantly better

217
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,690
better position to make our community

218
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,180
more sustainable as miles pointed out in

219
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,400
a in his opening talk for us humans this

220
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,370
is the natural thing to do and as an

221
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,349
added benefit our culture will be

222
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,450
perceived as more friendly and welcoming

223
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,340
so we have bigger chance of attracting

224
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,500
more new people and keeping them in the

225
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,120
community to benefit from their

226
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,040
experience that Jenna just showed us how

227
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,199
do you drink

228
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,709
another angle of sustainability is the

229
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,110
ability to pay people for their work

230
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,060
especially those who are not naturally

231
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,440
privileged enough to work in open source

232
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,810
otherwise and of course some open source

233
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,579
projects are funded by corporations but

234
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,890
the majority is not and at one point or

235
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,829
another this is going to be a problem

236
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:08,360
many here will be familiar with the

237
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,890
heartbleed vulnerability that was

238
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,959
discovered in openssl a while back and

239
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,230
that revealed two things first everyone

240
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,540
and their dog was relying on open SSL

241
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,190
for mission-critical encryption work

242
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,980
second the code was basically maintained

243
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,390
but by one person in their spare time

244
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,170
what could possibly go wrong this got

245
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,910
addressed fairly quickly but most open

246
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,800
source project are not as prolific while

247
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,209
still being the foundation of a lot of

248
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,920
other software open and closed and they

249
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,500
receive zero funding we have no culture

250
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,329
of making sure open source projects are

251
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,120
financially sustainable and we even have

252
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,800
people argue that money ruins open

253
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,050
source but that that these people could

254
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,200
be not more misguided I want to give

255
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,480
special thanks to Nadia Iqbal who's been

256
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,949
doing fantastic research on this topic

257
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:53,899
and it's now working at github to help

258
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,790
address this issue more broadly there

259
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,230
are links to her work at the end of my

260
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,000
slides can have enough drink tension of

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,790
the pause the technology industry is not

262
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,949
very diverse an open source is even

263
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:12,410
worse took me ages to come up with the

264
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,510
rhyme for this only twenty to

265
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,949
twenty-five percent of people in tech

266
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,839
are women and one to five maybe ten

267
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,519
percent of people in open source are

268
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,149
women trending downwards and we don't

269
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:24,649
even if numbers for the Democratic

270
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,240
demographics of other underrepresented

271
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,850
people in tech but the numbers will be a

272
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,550
lot worse we have a lot of work to do

273
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,899
it's a quick interlude on the words of

274
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,420
inclusion and diversity just to clear up

275
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,630
any misconceptions inclusion is everyone

276
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,949
and their dog are happy to be part of

277
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:41,600
your community and they can safely

278
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,550
engage like any other member and have

279
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,110
fun doing so and get support when they

280
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,540
needed diversity is when people get a

281
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,310
lot with a lot of background different

282
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,720
backgrounds and experience are part of

283
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,579
your community and these experience

284
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:54,199
inform your community's activities and

285
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:55,459
make them better stronger more resilient

286
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,770
and ultimately more successful as a

287
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,510
result basically repeating with Jenna

288
00:10:59,510 --> 00:10:59,980
just

289
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,420
on our slide thank you very much further

290
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,420
for the pre-work there and if you want

291
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,270
to learn more about this again at the

292
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,280
end of the slides with a bunch of videos

293
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,260
by someone called Lina Reinhard who's

294
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,000
given a bunch of fantastic talks about

295
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,830
this that will really inform you about

296
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,130
this now inclusivity must come before

297
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,850
diversity and diversity is a consequence

298
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,710
of inclusivity if you're trying to

299
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,510
increase diversity without making things

300
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,190
inclusive you not only set yourself up

301
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,230
for failure but new but for new

302
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,150
individuals will have they will have

303
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,490
horrible consequences at experiences so

304
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,280
don't do that so this is all a bit

305
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,290
sobering so let's look at some of the

306
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,770
good things like this kitten I have this

307
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,420
in my browser or command 35 being a bad

308
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,080
day or a bad moment of a really others

309
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,480
helps this is good let's do this for a

310
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,510
bit outside like miles to do like a

311
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,750
psychedelic version of this place

312
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,380
something I absolutely love about

313
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,730
javascript is the sense of collaboration

314
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,920
to move our collective understandings of

315
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,110
solutions forward I love the pace at

316
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,150
which this happens I like our community

317
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,460
gets a lot of attention by big

318
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,960
commercial players without any one of

319
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,610
them dominating and I like how

320
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,490
successful the whole bundle is we even

321
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,260
do get we do sorry we even get

322
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,630
competition right imagine ember didn't

323
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,370
have to compete with react they would

324
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,630
have never rewritten the rendering

325
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,520
engine to be faster than react and then

326
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,930
react would never have let that slide

327
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,490
and improve them they're designed to be

328
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,110
amber again and then ember one-up them

329
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,770
again and so on and like the

330
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,570
proliferation of useful ideas mentioned

331
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,610
before this also happens all the time

332
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,090
and we're all better off because of this

333
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,350
it clear downside of this and after

334
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,200
think I have to credit fellow speaker

335
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,910
marie cocco soccer for this idea is that

336
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,400
a lot of this happens in pacific time

337
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,290
maybe in the overlap of us eastern

338
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,380
pacific time asia and the EU play clear

339
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,050
second fiddle in this and while the pace

340
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,850
is thrilling sometimes these thing can't

341
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,370
seem to wait for a planet rotation so

342
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,410
everybody gets to say this limits our

343
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,420
view for solving issues the best way and

344
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,090
we can do a lot better we're doing

345
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,870
really well in edgy

346
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,970
I think aside from all the great online

347
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,529
resources everywhere there are events

348
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,120
like notes school and note together and

349
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
a lot of others that bring more people

350
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,990
into this community with the focus on

351
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,420
learning and collaboration and with the

352
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,580
strong culture of trying to include and

353
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,690
make safes make a safe space for

354
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,570
everyone I love the nature of

355
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,180
experimentation in our community for

356
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,010
example the continuum between fully

357
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,720
serviced I'd rendered sites and fully

358
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,850
front and rendered apps and everything

359
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,830
in between and the continuously shifting

360
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,510
trade-offs and the resulting technical

361
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,540
solutions they all set up set us up for

362
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,020
a better for a better future one of

363
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,730
these experiments is very close to my

364
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,400
heart it's a small modules one I fully

365
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,380
believe in the small modules philosophy

366
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,330
and semantic versioning in NPM and all

367
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,250
of that heck I even helped run

368
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,620
greenkeeper to make with the goal of

369
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,180
making all this best better for the

370
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,110
whole NPM community so we don't have the

371
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,970
full picture yet but the sub stachy and

372
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,650
extreme of everyone combining their

373
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,540
small modules from first principle has

374
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,760
its limits as has the not invented here

375
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,589
Laden no dependencies are right now on

376
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:20,080
one orlith way of programming and we're

377
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,640
continuously learning new things and

378
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,529
invent new tools that radically change

379
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,600
the way our habits in one way or another

380
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,970
and fascinating to follow a really like

381
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,770
what we're doing sometimes takes a

382
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,209
little longer if I figure something out

383
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,709
but eventually we'll get there I think

384
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,070
it's really cool while there are many

385
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,640
communities in JavaScript the biggest

386
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,300
one is clearly the web and that's my

387
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,520
origin story too I'm a child of the web

388
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,650
I believe it is one of the wonders of

389
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,260
the world and worth preserving one of

390
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,760
the most fascinating things about the

391
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,410
web is that it was designed with a focus

392
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,920
on the individual user one key component

393
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,620
the browser is an agent for the user it

394
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,050
works on behalf of the user given that

395
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,820
the web is so commercially significant

396
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,890
this design is a revolutionary to this

397
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,520
day when the web was invented

398
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,810
everybody's data lived on their

399
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,610
computers and browsers made sure that

400
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,800
websites couldn't steal that data now

401
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,390
everybody's data lives in the cloud and

402
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,220
browsers are ill-equipped to deal with

403
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,870
this new reality of so called corporate

404
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,030
surveillance this is something native

405
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,160
mobile especially us has an edge on the

406
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,600
weapon there's a few more things where

407
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,579
the web slagging be

408
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,670
however a lot of a lot of that is

409
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,019
getting addressed and I'm very happy to

410
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,730
see the progressive web app movement

411
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,439
embracing the mobile web as a first

412
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,540
class citizen I'm particularly excited

413
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,220
about this because about three years ago

414
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,799
in preparation for a workshop that we

415
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,869
did in most fast London I can't coined

416
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:44,879
the term of line first which is now an

417
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,679
industry standard Tom and the thinking

418
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,029
behind progressive web apps fully

419
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:50,220
embraced the offline first ideas it's

420
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,829
really cool around that time three years

421
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:55,079
ago we had built the first version of

422
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,549
hoodie and offline first backend for

423
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:59,009
your front-end web apps and while

424
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:00,209
service workers and the like weren't

425
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,879
around yet we were and still are

426
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,079
building fully offline capable web

427
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,499
applications assets data everything and

428
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,149
with hoodie we made things we made that

429
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:11,579
accessible to a lot more people taking a

430
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:12,959
book out of the jQuery in Johnny Five

431
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,629
playbook where we grew a little bit

432
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,970
early though because now I believe all

433
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,309
that fun stuff with having data offline

434
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:23,639
comes after you deserve Chris um but now

435
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,139
that we had three times to like mature

436
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:28,199
system at three years to mature system I

437
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,730
think now is the time for every one of

438
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,889
you to first learn service work and then

439
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,939
get into hoodie so that's really cool um

440
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:37,199
what I like most about progressive web

441
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,579
apps though is that they are designed

442
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:43,230
around a culture of empathy I'm else by

443
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,509
empathizing with users around the world

444
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:47,639
that may not have a gigabit fiber on

445
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,470
their phone for twenty-four seven we are

446
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,509
now building new web standards that will

447
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,040
inform our development culture to build

448
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,739
on the web with more people in mind this

449
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:57,269
is a very important shift in our culture

450
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:59,189
and couldn't be more happy about it

451
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:15,600
could be more happy to see it standards

452
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,720
my notes say waitful laughter so i'm

453
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:34,880
waiting for spaces thanks again to

454
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,800
Marika for bringing this up the old

455
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,650
saying goes standards are great there's

456
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,860
so many to choose from standardization

457
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,570
is what makes JavaScript the language

458
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,090
strong no single vendor can dictate what

459
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,830
the language is going to be and it's

460
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,750
very very powerful the same is true for

461
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,370
the surrounding technologies on the web

462
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,100
but standards processes are also not

463
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,560
very transparent first they are hidden

464
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,030
behind a bunch of acronyms that help

465
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,130
nobody really understand what is going

466
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:08,240
on w3c whatwg ECMA and it's just as

467
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,430
inaccessible as these acronyms are just

468
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,710
as inaccessible as these acronyms are so

469
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,420
the organization's behind them as well

470
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,390
as the processes you can contribute to

471
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,060
the HTML standard on github today did

472
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,120
you know that probably not do you feel

473
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,980
empowered to do so right now I don't

474
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,280
know about you but definitely not me so

475
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,710
you know how to get a seat on the tc39

476
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,960
the acronym committee that's inside the

477
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,060
ECMA acronym that defines the java /

478
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,760
standard i bet not and by the way i know

479
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,330
it's akma however can you guess how

480
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,650
diverse and inclusive these standards

481
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,380
groups are probably not very some of

482
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,910
them are realizing this and trying to

483
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,280
change it some don't and specifically

484
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,800
note core the team that is responsible

485
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,330
for building the runtime that runs all

486
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,760
our JavaScript's is openly reluctant to

487
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,230
become more inclusive despite numerous

488
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,480
people sending spending significant

489
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,830
amount of time trying to address the

490
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,990
issue because we have no culture of

491
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,490
demanding the diversity in our

492
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,380
leadership group and node core is a

493
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,480
leadership group node core gets away

494
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,240
with this we need to do better a lot of

495
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,250
technology happens in and around San

496
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,440
Francisco the melting pot nurse and the

497
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,990
abundance of capital allows the most

498
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,690
outlandish ideas

499
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,430
things to be tried out on the off chance

500
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,860
that they are useful later because

501
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,390
things are moving fast in technology

502
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,100
people are moving fast and technology

503
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,110
from a European perspective the US

504
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,910
employment laws facilitate this and

505
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,830
changing jobs every 6 to 12 months as

506
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,290
normal a two-year tenure the startup is

507
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,700
rare if not frowned upon as a result

508
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,110
things are really built with longevity

509
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,850
in mind when Twitter open source

510
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,250
bootstrap and it got really popular I

511
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,140
feared that as soon as the developers of

512
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,330
the sorry the Twitter employees leave

513
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,990
the project would be toast luckily that

514
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,970
has not happened because the bootstrap

515
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,740
developers left Twitter to go indie and

516
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,570
focus on bootstrap but that's not the

517
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,880
common story so as a result the rest of

518
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,440
the world has to deal with the

519
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,270
half-baked and short-sighted swath of

520
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,860
projects coming out of Silicon Valley

521
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,810
because our culture dictates that no

522
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,540
true software can develop anywhere else

523
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,210
and don't get me started on a region

524
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,040
that has witnessed a 40 year stretch of

525
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,960
hyper growth and that has produced more

526
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,190
millionaires and billionaires that

527
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,650
anyone cares to count and still has one

528
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,910
of the most rampant cases of

529
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,860
homelessness anywhere on this planet and

530
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,420
can't be bothered to do anything about

531
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,160
it other than creating a second layer of

532
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,560
reality for just tech workers what is

533
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,060
the point of innovation if you're not

534
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,620
building a better society most software

535
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,970
is designed and built without any

536
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,770
understanding of the circumstances of

537
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,240
the majority of the people that end up

538
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,130
using that software and the results are

539
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:52,190
increasingly terrible

540
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,640
miles brought up a lie ship in his

541
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,800
opening talk and as a whole we're liking

542
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,670
a culture of a laceup we are not very

543
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,050
good at this and i know i've personally

544
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,150
failed at this and probably continue to

545
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,910
do so i know what instance of known her

546
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,340
ass ax in our community not being called

547
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,200
out for their behavior despite enough

548
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,880
people knowing about it i've personally

549
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,980
got back got a hint of what was going on

550
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,840
a while back but i neglected to follow

551
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,480
up that was a mistake on my part because

552
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,340
i kept hearing in confidence that the

553
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,510
harasser has been making their rounds

554
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,390
through the community this particular

555
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,820
instance is now improving but all of

556
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,230
this happens behind the scenes because

557
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,180
we have no culture that knows how to

558
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,460
deal with this and there are so many

559
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,170
more cases that are not transparent to

560
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,940
this community or if they are they are

561
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,120
tolerated the sad thing is it probably

562
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,520
happened in this event as well it's just

563
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,560
the odds it's not likely that this

564
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,270
hasn't happened here so um I'm not here

565
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,070
to tell you what to think is right or

566
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,170
wrong I just want you to think for

567
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,420
yourself about our culture and what it

568
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,310
enables and if you are okay with that

569
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,830
are you okay with the fact that most

570
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,480
salaries in our industry come from

571
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,100
intrusive advertising that's beyond

572
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,690
creepy and as something sometimes

573
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,040
life-threatening consequences for

574
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,020
individuals or give governments and

575
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,850
cover the corporation's increasing

576
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,860
amount of power about our lives are you

577
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,830
okay with that we're actively excluding

578
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,210
the majority of humanity from

579
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,590
decision-making in technology and

580
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,230
especially JavaScript I okay with the

581
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,730
fact that our industry is built on

582
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,350
systemic oppression of anyone who's not

583
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,080
a white man are you okay with the fact

584
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,700
that rampant misogyny and abuse goes

585
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,560
relatively unchecked in our industry and

586
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,120
Jake Applebaum is just the proverbial

587
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,790
tip of the iceberg I okay with the fact

588
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,470
that women get systematically paid less

589
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,240
than men for the same job are you okay

590
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,160
with the fact that women of color get

591
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,860
paid even less for the same job are you

592
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,180
okay with the fact that people with an

593
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,730
african-american sounding name or fifty

594
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,110
percent less likely to get a job

595
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,720
interview I okay with the fact that most

596
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,610
startups founded and funded and thus

597
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,350
controlled by a demographic that just

598
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,360
does not have the purpose sorry just

599
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,550
does not have the perspective to wield

600
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,380
that power responsibly and who build

601
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,730
solutions for people like themselves

602
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,650
rather than the 99 percent rest of the

603
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,350
world I okay with the fact that we are

604
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,340
building our industry

605
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,020
on the foundation of volunteer and

606
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,659
emotional labor and burnout most of

607
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:12,789
these problems and are just problems in

608
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:14,320
the JavaScript community further

609
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,140
problems of the tech industry or society

610
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,179
at large so why should we care to fix

611
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:23,169
them number one because it affects us we

612
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,520
have leadership teams that are not

613
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,630
equipped to make white reaching

614
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,700
decisions and we and our project or

615
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,159
words off offer it our first motivation

616
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,720
could be that we make our own lives

617
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,929
better number to keeping our own hose

618
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:36,909
clean before asking others to keep

619
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:40,630
theirs it's kind of only logical three

620
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,789
it makes us more sustainable and said

621
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:46,809
sets us up for long-term success these

622
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:49,360
are fine reasons but more importantly

623
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,539
our culture increasingly defines the

624
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,789
world if we get it right it will spread

625
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:56,850
like our culture's already spreading I

626
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,590
believe it is imperative to leave the

627
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,330
world behind better than we found it and

628
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,940
as such it is our moral duty to make

629
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,309
sure our culture's one the generations

630
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:08,200
to come can build upon and be proud of I

631
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,480
don't want to be remembered to be the

632
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,250
generation that is missing out on

633
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,470
affecting much needed change as being

634
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,179
complacent in the face of overwhelming

635
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:19,809
evidence that despite our successes we

636
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,630
have a lot of work ahead of us I want

637
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,960
the closing speaker of JS conf Iceland

638
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,840
2066 remembers and say that generation

639
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,760
they really pulled their weight and set

640
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,039
us up for long-term success with a solid

641
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,320
foundation to build a community on and

642
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,000
to build software for everyone on this

643
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,940
planet with everyone on this planet that

644
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,070
is why I care and I hope that is why you
