[Music]

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,340
everyone coming out to my talk very nice

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,250
to see all of you I feel like we cut

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,230
attendance by half from the party last

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,750
night so you guys are all troopers so

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,220
this talk is normally called down the

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,529
SVG rabbit hole there's a lot of things

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,449
that we go through this is going to be

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,870
what we're gonna end up with this is all

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,380
inline SVG is the only piece that is

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,559
external on here is a CSS fill with a

12
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,610
hex code value it's one of my it's it's

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,230
one of the coolest things ever and

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,420
nobody uses it and it blows my mind that

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,890
nobody uses it

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,559
these were graphics from a project

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,059
called pro gaming League they're now

18
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,160
called millennial eSports they build

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
they service like online gaming

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,170
companies I'm not a gamer like Halo and

21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,420
League of Legends and all that fun stuff

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,729
so for all the gaming nerds we built

23
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,970
these really fun animations for it so

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,770
I'm a former nuclear engineer turned

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,780
front-end developer I have a really

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,340
crazy story to tell you about that you

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,250
can ask me later I work on the

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,740
international growth team with a company

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,600
called Shopify we are coming to Germany

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,360
so shameless plug if any back-end devs

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,640
are looking for e-commerce stuff come

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,259
and talk to me after or one of the

33
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,150
recruiters Julia she's here she gave a

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,729
talk yesterday I also run a business

35
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,829
called zona Fitness Academy it's an

36
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,659
online e-learning platform for fitness

37
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,450
trainers I live in a tiny mountain town

38
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,560
in the middle of nowhere called

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,909
Revelstoke it's about an eight hour

40
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,829
drive from Vancouver but none of you

41
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:44,579
know where that is

42
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,759
so I just stay Vancouver it's better and

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,240
I am a Sports adrenaline junkie and this

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,430
was our pet bear that lived in our yard

45
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,990
for about seven days in in a tree fun

46
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,790
fact

47
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,500
okay so today we're gonna be going I'm

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,149
just gonna start at baseline so that

49
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,369
everybody here kind of has an

50
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,750
understanding of where we're getting

51
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,610
started with SVG's how many of you use

52
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,940
SVG's in production right now how many

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,950
of you have like you feel like you

54
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,890
stand each of the attributes that are in

55
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,720
an SVG element okay so this is why we

56
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,090
started a baseline from there we're

57
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,410
gonna talk a little bit about the bones

58
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,540
of our SVG and just talk a little bit

59
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,430
about collaborating with designers so

60
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,769
that you can make this less painful

61
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,360
because this process can be generally

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,099
quite painful for developers if they

63
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,510
haven't if they're not working with a

64
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,950
designer that really understands what

65
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,420
they're doing and exporting stuff from

66
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,580
sketch or illustrator I'm gonna talk a

67
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,470
little bit about my fed SVG workflow and

68
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,060
then we're gonna get into the guts of

69
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,920
the actual talk which is the super cool

70
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,840
SVG animations that you saw at the

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,250
beginning so when you're working with a

72
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,470
design team you want to make sure the at

73
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,579
the beginning of the project you

74
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,840
determine what your goals are actually

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,630
gonna be so if you want stagnant or

76
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,819
animated SVG's because this will totally

77
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,470
change your fed workflow and it'll

78
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,269
change the amount of time that you want

79
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,519
your designers spending in in their

80
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,970
sketch files so for this reason you want

81
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,380
to communicate really early on in the

82
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,299
projects what your primary goals are

83
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,180
gonna be so today I'm gonna talk a

84
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,910
little bit about exporting from sketch

85
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,310
just so that we have a baseline of that

86
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,359
so when you guys go back to your design

87
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,560
team you're like hey you're doing this

88
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,569
wrong so you should probably do it the

89
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:29,579
right way make my life a little bit

90
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,400
easier I am NOT gonna be talking about

91
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,510
exporting from illustrator because

92
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,459
there's a lot of really awesome online

93
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,739
tutorials and there are great resources

94
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,079
for that I am however gonna talk about

95
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,540
what it looks like when a designer will

96
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,040
send you an SVG and sketch so I realized

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,299
this is illustrator there's a screenshot

98
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,739
of illustrator but I wanted to kind of

99
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,680
just elaborate on the point that is a

100
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,200
really ugly piece of code this is by

101
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,299
default what it looks like from your

102
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,519
designer it's totally unnecessary okay

103
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,099
all of those nested files so for every

104
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,980
single layer that goes in here this is

105
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,900
this is exactly what the like default

106
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,280
exports gonna be when you come out of

107
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,500
sketch so there is this great command

108
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,289
line that you can put in and restart

109
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,180
your computer for your design team and

110
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,639
it will take out a large portion of

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,750
those ugly guts that you just saw you

112
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,130
can write that down but the slides are

113
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,900
tweeted out so if you want that you can

114
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,759
take a look at it there's a company out

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,979
of New York called thoughtbot this is

116
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,810
what they use for all of it but it

117
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,310
essentially just creates a compact form

118
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,669
of the SVG it's a little bit nicer so

119
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,130
let's talk about exporting SVG's from

120
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,550
sketch so within sketch we have this

121
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,250
infinite canvas and so what happens is

122
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,500
the SVG element itself will have

123
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,190
transforms and translates attributes

124
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,009
attached to the actual SVG and so for

125
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:59,370
that reason doing really advanced

126
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,169
effects can be difficult because you

127
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:02,639
also have to take into account the

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,930
already existing transforms and

129
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,760
translate so if you have this infinite

130
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,190
canvas and you have this like small SVG

131
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,710
on one specific point within that canvas

132
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,800
that generally is not very helpful and

133
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,270
so what you want to be doing is actually

134
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,389
creating in your own art board for the

135
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,539
SVG itself then you're gonna take and

136
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,349
select the layers within the the panel

137
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:26,430
from there you're gonna take and flatten

138
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,500
everything flattening just takes and

139
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,620
merges the pathways that you saw so each

140
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,190
of these small elements on here will

141
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,010
have specific paths or an extra element

142
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,180
in indented into the SVG and so what we

143
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,979
want to do is make sure that when we're

144
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,080
using the fill on it that it's all

145
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,070
within one single element and so doing

146
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,260
that process takes what you saw on the

147
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,520
left to what you saw on the right and

148
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,750
that's a pretty nice piece of code to

149
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,220
work with it's kind of more readable

150
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,340
HTML you know I I like it it's easier

151
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,199
and so this SVG is literally just the

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,750
clothes

153
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,250
imagine that X that you have on every

154
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,159
single modal every single like form

155
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:15,840
element whatever you want to call it

156
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,889
this that's like that's a really simple

157
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,320
icon it shouldn't be that complex and so

158
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,260
what happens is now we have one folder

159
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,710
with two elements so we have two paths

160
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,440
which are respectively each side of the

161
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,770
X so I'm gonna skip that so let's talk a

162
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,220
little bit about SVG's for beginners

163
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,920
generally this is how the the SVG's are

164
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,460
defined you have something called a

165
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,790
grouping you have your IDs your strokes

166
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,010
and so for every single group orgy

167
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,840
element within an SVG that is a folder

168
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,900
respective to illustrator or sketch and

169
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,270
so we want to remove a lot of that

170
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,010
nesting the other thing that you'll see

171
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,110
in here which is like kind of messy is

172
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,540
this transform and translate piece that

173
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,730
I had talked about previously this is

174
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,130
literally sketch taking and moving that

175
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,200
element where it is within the infinite

176
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,030
canvas on the page and we don't really

177
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,090
want that because that will that adds a

178
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,070
lot of variable or variations when we're

179
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,450
taking and doing a lot of these crazy

180
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,750
animations and then you have each of

181
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,170
your actual elements or pathways now

182
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,490
these numbers and letters they all mean

183
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,900
something I'm totally happy to have a

184
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,500
discussion about what they mean but it's

185
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,390
kind of just how the browser will read

186
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,500
read the elements so what we want to end

187
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,830
up with is a really succinct form of the

188
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,250
SVG so we have the view box which is

189
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,890
essentially the artboard of the element

190
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,360
so wherever the element lives on that

191
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,580
actual page so imagine you have a canvas

192
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,990
that's 33 by 33 and the starting point

193
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,060
is at 0 0 which is the top left hand

194
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,540
corner and from there it goes across the

195
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,260
canvas and so by definition we have a

196
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,660
grouping take which is the folder that

197
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,220
contains everything and then we have two

198
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,800
pathways so this first pathway is that

199
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,830
first cross of the stroke and the second

200
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,360
pathway is the second cross of the

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,590
stroke and that's it that's like a

202
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,490
simple X icon it's a little this is

203
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,960
literally just so that you guys have a

204
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,880
baseline to understand like how our

205
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,770
SVG's set up so let's talk a little bit

206
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,380
about SVG optimization so there's this

207
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,860
awesome tool called SVG oh I'm sure that

208
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,169
most of you use it if you're doing crazy

209
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,880
animations I wouldn't really recommend

210
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,150
it they have done a significant amount

211
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,750
of work I'll explain so unless you took

212
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,220
the time to go through all those steps

213
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,960
that I talked about within sketch

214
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,200
SVG Oh actually will prevent you from

215
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,540
being able to modify the SVG in the way

216
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,000
that you need to later on so you can use

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,450
SVG oh and do these animations and

218
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,700
effects later on but you want to make

219
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,830
sure that it's within its own artboard

220
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,090
or within its own canvas because

221
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,770
otherwise you have these transforms and

222
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,410
translates attributes attached to the

223
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,350
SVG pathways or to the SVG elements and

224
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,300
this will cause a discrepancy within the

225
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,190
animations and it will actually prevent

226
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,530
you from having it accessed on multiple

227
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,320
browsers so again

228
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,020
beware of SVG oh it's good for like

229
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,370
icons and like if you're doing really

230
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,870
simple stuff but if you're doing more

231
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,240
complex animations I still to this day

232
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,990
will edit SVG's in sublime or like in

233
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,180
your text editor because otherwise

234
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,490
there's there's too many variations and

235
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,330
you have to start back at the beginning

236
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,010
this is another fun little snippet of

237
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,530
code that I love so generally as a

238
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,900
front-end developer you'll define a lot

239
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,120
of your base lines just like you would

240
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,280
with the image iframe and video element

241
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,260
you also want to add SVG to the max with

242
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,030
a hundred percent as your defaults and

243
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,290
the reason why you want to do this is

244
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,940
because you don't want the SVG to be

245
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,000
exploded outside of its parent container

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
this is just one of those things that I

247
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,390
always add to my base files okay so I'm

248
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,460
gonna talk a little bit about some like

249
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,220
cool how to's that you can actually have

250
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,960
so the beautiful thing about SPG's is

251
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,340
you can define it once within the DOM

252
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,380
and you can utilize it across the entire

253
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,330
project okay so imagine you have social

254
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,400
icons or you have logos this is like a

255
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,770
very standard example of how you can use

256
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,240
SVG's and so we had a project not that

257
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,600
long ago where we had social icons

258
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,040
defined in the footer we had social

259
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,070
icons to find in our profiles and then

260
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,990
we had multiple versions of our logo

261
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,630
depending on where it was and so each of

262
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,730
those items are only defined once on the

263
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,890
page and so you have that pathway of

264
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,420
letters and numbers that defines the

265
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:05,370
actual shape of the element yeah so you

266
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,980
can utilize this awesome element called

267
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,480
you

268
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,670
within your SVG where you define the

269
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,100
pathway once and you can target which

270
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,790
element or icons you want to utilize

271
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:24,330
with an ID and the use tag and so that

272
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,370
allows you to define the SVG once and

273
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,710
use it everywhere and so what ends up

274
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,470
happening is you have a really long

275
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,990
piece of text or like a really long

276
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,200
piece of like SVG code that will allow

277
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,240
you to take and target each of those

278
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,360
items so in this case like you can see

279
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
in the top left hand corner the little

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
like lightning bolt icon you can see

281
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,920
that it's used in like quite a few

282
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,720
places and so what happens is I have

283
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,380
that pathway to find once and I can take

284
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,260
it target it just by calling an x-linked

285
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,200
href and so that correlates to an ID

286
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,720
that's attached to the pathway or the

287
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,930
group within the SVG and you can use

288
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,560
both then you can take an out of fill

289
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,270
color you can add like width and height

290
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,120
attributes if you want the same thing

291
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,510
goes with how I'm utilizing all of these

292
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,750
SVG badges or like these skull badges

293
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,610
that you see across the entire site and

294
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,740
the other way to do this as Wally's with

295
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,330
a lot of these like social icons which

296
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,750
is also a pretty standard piece so I'm

297
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,910
gonna take and see if I can find this

298
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,850
lovely piece of code so I can show you a

299
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,410
react project that we did not too long

300
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:56,910
ago

301
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,459
okay so can you guys read that okay or

302
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:03,329
do you want me to increase the font size

303
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:06,759
okay so in this in this file we're

304
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,569
defining a component called social icons

305
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:12,910
you can see within here we have like the

306
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,769
angellist icon we have a twitter icon

307
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,739
with a grouping and we have a social

308
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:23,379
Facebook icon durable etc etc and so

309
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,299
these pathways are only defined once on

310
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:28,509
on the actual page within the Dom and so

311
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:30,069
I pulled that into the footer and I can

312
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:31,179
take and Target it throughout the entire

313
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:34,540
project on any given page so what

314
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,179
happens if I is like is I give it a

315
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,910
width and a height of zero and it sits

316
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,009
it like lives on the end within the Dom

317
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:43,600
but you don't actually see it unless you

318
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,029
call it with those pieces of with those

319
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,879
pieces of code using the the use element

320
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,949
so I can take and target it the same way

321
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:56,919
where it'd be like social - Twitter or

322
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,109
social - Facebook and these are one of

323
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:00,519
the ways that you can take and actually

324
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,619
reduce the amount of code that you have

325
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:04,660
within within the page and so that's

326
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,009
just one of the fun ways that you can

327
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:10,540
utilize SVG's so let's get into the like

328
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,970
actual guts of the the talk the like fun

329
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,860
stuff I don't know about any of you I am

330
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,019
like a super math nerd so there are

331
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:22,419
matrices in here there's cubic Bezier

332
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,809
functions or standard deviations it's

333
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:29,559
awesome so some of these filters and one

334
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,939
of the cool things that you don't that

335
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:32,350
you won't actually know on this this is

336
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,299
the exact same SVG element and the only

337
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,709
thing that I'm plying that's different

338
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,480
on here is I'm either adding a fill

339
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,539
color or I am not applying a fill color

340
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,179
at all so by default SVG's are black

341
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:45,160
within the within the Dom if you don't

342
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,289
apply a fill color of any kind you're

343
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,029
gonna get that and so the reason why

344
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:53,039
this like you can see on the top right -

345
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,299
the reason why they're white is because

346
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,779
I'm applying a white light effect to the

347
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:01,689
SVG element itself and there's no 3d

348
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,489
effects but it's literally the exact

349
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:06,399
same piece of SVG code or pathway that's

350
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,919
defined once and then you can just take

351
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,310
and apply these effects these ways

352
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,430
so if you want to jump into code pen

353
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,350
there is a code pen so you can take and

354
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,029
play around with any of these there's

355
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,740
two versions of each of them there's one

356
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,440
with G SAP that uses it and then there's

357
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,710
one that utilizes the inline animate if

358
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,720
you go some blur like all of the inline

359
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,480
SVG elements so you can use for these

360
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,720
elements so this is the baseline okay so

361
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,500
we have a class set we're applying an

362
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,450
inline style with a fill color you can

363
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,940
do this within the CSS as well we're

364
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,440
defining the view box which is really

365
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,320
important so on here you'll see some of

366
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,970
the effects that are created where the

367
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,410
view box needs to actually be a little

368
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,089
bit bigger because of the glow effects

369
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:54,470
that you have otherwise you'll hit the

370
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,060
the corners of the box and you don't

371
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,460
want that to happen and then what's

372
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,860
happening is I'm targeting that really

373
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,790
really large SVG pathway I'll show it to

374
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,020
you after if we have time so the same

375
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,850
way that you would take and define your

376
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,089
definitions within the SVG you would

377
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,030
also take and apply the filter element

378
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,700
within that in line so we're gonna go

379
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,250
into detail a little bit for this and so

380
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,190
this particular SVG doesn't have a fill

381
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,130
color on it okay it is by default no

382
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,170
fill there's no style applied to it all

383
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,800
it's just this code that's in here and

384
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,830
so what you can see within this is we

385
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,089
have a filter where we're defining the

386
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:39,560
spotlight so the reason why I want to do

387
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,260
that is because I want to take and

388
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,589
utilize the user like the filter element

389
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:47,720
that you need to apply to the SVG itself

390
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,910
so what happens in here is you take and

391
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,140
define the ID and you give it a name

392
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,459
with the filter effects that you can

393
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,980
take and apply it across and so in here

394
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,410
you take a go son blur and so I'm taking

395
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,579
the original the original element and

396
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,130
I'm calling the result of the original

397
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,620
source graphic after you take and apply

398
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,810
this effect so I'm going to take and

399
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,839
create a blur effect with a standard

400
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,050
deviation of two okay from there I give

401
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,990
it a result and call it blur one then I

402
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,959
take that initial blur one and I

403
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,049
put it within the the new lighting

404
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,700
effect that I want to apply as well and

405
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,620
so I'm creating a specular exponent

406
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,730
light so the specular lighting effect is

407
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,890
literally just this light that will take

408
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,000
and open or close as if you had a narrow

409
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,740
or really wide light that you want to

410
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,779
apply to anything across here so the

411
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:46,039
same way that you would a spotlight in

412
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,809
normal like think of it in that same

413
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:50,299
context then I'm giving it a lighting

414
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:53,510
color of just off-white because that's

415
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,690
fun and then I need to tell the SVG

416
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,539
where in the box so imagine you have

417
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,730
this 3d box and you have the SVG on this

418
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,429
one space I need to tell it where within

419
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:07,279
the x y&z planes we actually want to put

420
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,720
this light so I can put it really high

421
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,520
up I can put it right in front of it I

422
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,260
can put it really low and so you can

423
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,850
take and like imagine this 3d

424
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,309
dimensional box that you have and just

425
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:18,320
take and apply that same filter effect

426
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,320
to it then what happens is I need to

427
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,630
take the original source graphic then I

428
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,580
need to take the all of the effects that

429
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,020
I had applied to this and I need to

430
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,059
squash them together because otherwise

431
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,299
you have this really blurred you have

432
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,850
this really blurred SVG and by applying

433
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,440
both of those together and creating

434
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,299
these layers it's the same way that you

435
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:39,919
would take and apply layers within like

436
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,470
Photoshop or illustrator you just take

437
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,049
and pile it on top of one another and so

438
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:47,659
then I will take the original source

439
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,990
graphic I put it in and then I take the

440
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,950
the result from from the specular

441
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,890
lighting effect and I squish them

442
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,840
together there's Anna rhythmic equation

443
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,059
that's applied to this I'm also happy to

444
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,419
talk about that a little bit later but

445
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:10,640
for now we're gonna open up this item so

446
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,610
you guys can see it so one of the things

447
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:18,409
that I really like to do is remove this

448
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:21,220
source graphic so that you guys can see

449
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,760
what happens so by removing the source

450
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,510
graphic you actually you have a much

451
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,450
more distinct piece but by adding it

452
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,110
back in you can see that there's like a

453
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,970
more defined line on here and so

454
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,500
the lighting effect will actually take

455
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,020
and apply it across the entire ecosystem

456
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:49,670
and then if you want to you can take in

457
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,450
decrease the specular exponent you know

458
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,280
actually widen the light for you so as

459
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,380
you increase the specular exponent the

460
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,290
the more narrow the light gets and the

461
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:05,570
difference of the fact that you'll see

462
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,450
[Music]

463
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,960
okay so I talked a little bit about the

464
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:22,280
FE exponent piece so that really big ass

465
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,890
piece of code right there that's

466
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,930
defining the the skull it's massive it's

467
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,550
because of all of the points that are

468
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,730
within the vector itself in order to be

469
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,200
able to squash this and just apply

470
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,100
everything to a single SVG that's the

471
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,500
effect that comes from it okay so we

472
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,610
talked a little bit about the source

473
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,130
graphic now we're gonna talk a little

474
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,810
bit about the glow effect so I don't

475
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,070
know if you guys can see that it is

476
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,060
glowing right now essentially what

477
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:02,510
happens in this particular SVG is we'll

478
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,890
just create this a little bit bigger

479
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,840
okay now you should be able to see it

480
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,580
going in and out a little bit quicker

481
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,780
okay so this is you guys can see that

482
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,580
okay so this is a pretty complex example

483
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,640
what happens if I take away this

484
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,940
original source graphic is it just

485
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,260
creates this like really blurry effect

486
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,350
on it so you can see why you would want

487
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,420
to have the two layers merge together in

488
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,020
order to create create that actual

489
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,600
effect and so I'm just gonna go through

490
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,830
all of this code right now so we have a

491
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,980
we have an

492
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,110
called glow where we're defining the

493
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,850
actual filter that we want to apply to

494
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,409
the SVG then we are calling that same

495
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:04,130
URL within the SVG parent element

496
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,730
I am also applying a color fill with

497
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:25,789
this like blue hex code okay so the

498
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:27,980
actual element that we're creating here

499
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,019
is we're taking and applying that glow

500
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:31,909
effect we're applying a standard

501
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:34,789
deviation of 50 so that that 50 is just

502
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:40,399
how far away or like how much of a how

503
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,840
much we're actually going to be blurring

504
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,330
the the element itself and so the higher

505
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,429
that you go it's zero to a hundred that

506
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:48,549
you can be using the higher you go the

507
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:51,950
more blurry the image is gonna be we're

508
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,510
taking that initial result sorry I can't

509
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,059
like see where my mouse is there we go

510
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:02,360
so we're taking that initial result by

511
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,950
applying that effect and we're calling

512
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,440
it spec one from there I want to take

513
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,850
and apply the animate the Elm animate

514
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,100
element and I want to animate the

515
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,840
standard deviation so I want the glow to

516
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,000
create this pulsing effect and so by

517
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,830
targeting the standard deviation I can

518
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,450
tell it to go from zero to fifty which

519
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,740
is the standard deviation that we

520
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,529
defined in the original parent goes on

521
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,389
bluer element then I'm gonna give it a

522
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,850
duration of 0.1 seconds

523
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,860
and I want to repeat the count

524
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,630
indefinitely so that the glow starts to

525
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,809
like create that pulse effect by going

526
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:40,840
in and out now I'm gonna be taking oh

527
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,820
I'm gonna be taking the the values of

528
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,760
zero to 50/50 back to zero so I want

529
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,419
this to be a relatively smooth animation

530
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:52,039
and so I want it to go up and then come

531
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:52,700
back down

532
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,080
so in the same way that you would take

533
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,679
and define that within your CSS you can

534
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,090
take and define it within the element

535
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,909
itself and now we have the key times and

536
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,430
the key splines now those respect

537
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:08,380
we are related to the keyframes and the

538
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,090
timing element that you want to be

539
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,100
applying within this CSS the key splines

540
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,280
are the cubic Bezier function so instead

541
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,950
of having the cubic Bezier defined with

542
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,260
four different numbers you take and have

543
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,420
it within the matrix itself also happy

544
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,830
to explain that math - a little bit

545
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,960
later and then from there we want to

546
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,790
take and squish all of these effects

547
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,070
together with the FE composit element

548
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,540
itself and so you're gonna take the

549
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,130
original source graphic you're gonna

550
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,410
take the result which we had defined

551
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,200
espect 1 and you're gonna merge them

552
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,200
together and from there that's how you

553
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,110
create these like awesome effects but

554
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,810
again you want to be able to define that

555
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,450
right at the beginning and so that's

556
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,430
kind of part of the part of the

557
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,960
discussion so now we're gonna move on to

558
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,510
one of the other ones that I really like

559
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,940
and so this is that same point light

560
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,340
you're applying but now I'm applying an

561
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,310
actual animate element to it and taking

562
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,080
and moving the light across the plane

563
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,040
the X plane back and forth across the

564
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,570
page and so one of the things that

565
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,970
you'll see within here is on the right

566
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,180
hand side the light actually goes off of

567
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,000
the canvas itself so you're applying a

568
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,610
negative value to that whereas you want

569
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,140
to be starting if you want to be

570
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,060
starting right at zero you'll see that

571
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:33,210
it hits the limits of the actual box and

572
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,740
so within here I've defined the filter

573
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,900
of the spot light moving I will open

574
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:48,010
this hopefully it works okay super so

575
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,630
again we're taking in applying the

576
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,310
effect we're giving it an ID now what's

577
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,040
happening in here is we were applying a

578
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,400
blur effect to the to the original

579
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,050
source graphic itself we're calling that

580
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,300
result by applying a standard deviation

581
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,870
of to blur one from there we are taking

582
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,210
and that end results and we're putting

583
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,350
it into the next filter that we want to

584
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,850
be creating and we're calling the

585
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,419
results of

586
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:21,190
that SPECT 1 from there I'm taking and

587
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,200
adding a special specular exponent so

588
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,059
remember in that first example that we

589
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,919
had with the light where we had a really

590
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,259
high or really low value of the light

591
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:32,830
and so within this particular SVG the

592
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,820
light source is actually really narrow

593
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,850
and I'm applying a lighting color of

594
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:45,369
just off-white okay um I'll wrap it up

595
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:48,460
real quick then from there I'm taking

596
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,710
and defining where within this cube I

597
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,960
actually want this light source to be

598
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,220
living okay from there I want to animate

599
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,080
the point light itself so I want it to

600
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,090
be going across the X plane then from

601
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,419
all of that I'm gonna take and merge

602
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,779
everything together into one SVG and so

603
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:14,320
this particular effect it takes the

604
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,450
original source graphic and it takes the

605
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,759
results of the other three effects that

606
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,440
we had applied and it merges it all into

607
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,190
one does that make sense

608
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,609
super okay so let's talk about browser

609
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,980
support hahaha the fun part you know

610
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:39,509
what I crushing all of our souls so

611
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:42,279
there is this lovely lady called Sarah

612
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,649
Dresner she says that smell is dead

613
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:48,330
so smell is the EFI goes on blur the

614
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,429
epic opposite the inline elements that

615
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:53,169
you can utilize right now it still works

616
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:54,549
in the browser it still works across

617
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:58,389
chrome if you go to can I use it has

618
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:03,539
pretty good support okay however and

619
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,950
like a lot of the effects that I showed

620
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,179
you before they also have really good

621
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,869
support but if you want to be using this

622
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:12,429
across browsers there's a library called

623
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,769
G SAP or green sock that you can utilize

624
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:17,739
and you can take and apply those exact

625
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:21,190
same effects using their library and

626
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,869
it'll add a polyfill and you can utilize

627
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,179
it across multiple browsers it is using

628
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:26,529
Java scripts you wouldn't actually be

629
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:29,470
using this with the inline

630
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,909
SVG elements that I was showing you

631
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,370
earlier but again like all that's up on

632
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,720
the code pen so if you guys want to play

633
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,919
around with it like you're more than

634
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,880
welcome to Oh

635
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,630
for those of you that code Andrew

636
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,730
because I code in Ruby I found this Ruby

637
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,440
helper a few years ago and I thought it

638
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,130
was just epic and you can just take and

639
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,740
call whatever the original SVG element

640
00:28:50,740 --> 00:29:03,159
it is and that's it thank you we got

641
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,450
five minutes if anybody has any

642
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,500
questions guys can grill me yeah right

643
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,730
so his question was is it better to have

644
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,490
the component rendered over and over and

645
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,440
over again or is it better within like

646
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,480
the react or is it better to have it

647
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,909
defined once and just utilize the use

648
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:24,549
element and so in that case that you're

649
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:27,220
talking about I usually will put that

650
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,870
component within the footer because the

651
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,600
footer is never going to disappear and

652
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,720
so from there I can take and call the

653
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,150
use element across the entire ecosystem

654
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,390
of my react application and the icons

655
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,510
will render the same does that answer

656
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,150
your question kind of sort of we can

657
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,340
talk more about it after if you want do

658
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,289
I have any other questions no super see

659
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:54,250
you guys later thank you
