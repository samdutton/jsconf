1
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,390

so yeah let's have some fun with the

2
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,400
Nintendo which is a fine piece of

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,689
hardware even today so what are what is

4
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:30,820
this thing that I'm going to be talking

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,400
about I guess it's the latest in 1980s

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,890
music technology this is controlling a

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,199
Nintendo sound like the sound stuff that

8
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:43,930
the microprocessor works or the sound

9
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,239
stuff that makes the or that sound stuff

10
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,920
that is in the microprocessor like right

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,890
compiling down to the assembler through

12
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,609
JavaScript so this piece of hardware

13
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:58,960
right here is what we're going to be

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,989
running everything on and there's no

15
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:03,640
trickery or involved or whatever its

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,060
actual Nintendo programs like running

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,289
just want to make some people are like

18
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:09,880
hey it's like you know you have some

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,520
like crazy thing but no it's real um so

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,590
like when I first started this project

21
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,580
the goal was to make it easy to write

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,149
music for a Nintendo and that that's

23
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,130
been done a lot in the past also there's

24
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,009
trackers which are basically sequencers

25
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:30,940
that you can use to like sequence music

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,130
on Nintendo itself or you could have

27
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,619
programs it will output like the actual

28
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,709
sound like of the Nintendo or emulate

29
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:40,959
the sound chip but I wanted to do it a

30
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,610
little bit differently I wanted to do it

31
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,099
using javascript because JavaScript and

32
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:49,869
whatever right so why a lot of people

33
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,060
you know why why you want to do this in

34
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,310
JavaScript it's to me it's self-evident

35
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,709
the I mean JavaScript awesome rides a

36
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:03,610
language that i really like but the

37
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,310
whole project itself like i really like

38
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,830
this sort of music this chip tunis sound

39
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,360
the i grew up in the 80s playing a lot

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,910
of nintendo 45 year old like playing

41
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,810
super mario brothers all the time or

42
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,849
you know whatever Zelda and all those

43
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,000
games I think over over that amount of

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,440
time like there's a nostalgia factor

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,700
that like those tunes like I didn't pay

46
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,840
attention to the music but they're

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,080
ingrained in my brain now and so I love

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,090
it I don't know how else to explain it I

49
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,250
think that probably a lot of people have

50
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,010
that nostalgia factor they look back to

51
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,750
their childhood and whatever they did a

52
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,640
lot or play it a lot it's far as like

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,250
video games or music or whatever they

54
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,720
gravitate towards that so I think that's

55
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,620
a big thing but the javascript part is

56
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,380
because of browsers now I knew that if I

57
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,440
could if I could get something working

58
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,830
in JavaScript I would have a path to get

59
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,140
to the browser and that's important

60
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,890
because once once you do that if you

61
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,930
provide a low-level JavaScript API to

62
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,010
this sound engine you you can create or

63
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,989
you can give the opportunity for people

64
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,380
to create fancy you is for tracker

65
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,040
sequencers that are all web based and I

66
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,299
think that's really cool and I actually

67
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:25,640
want to do that but I think this is like

68
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,760
the first step to that point so that's

69
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,040
that's primarily why and also because

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,750
it's a lot of fun to hack on a Nintendo

71
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,829
with JavaScript it's just it's crazy so

72
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,690
the next the next question is like how

73
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,870
is this working because it seemed sort

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,430
of magical to have a Nintendo and

75
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,220
JavaScript and stuff so to get this to

76
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,139
work I had to read a lot about how the

77
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,290
microprocessor works about how the 6502

78
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,109
assembler like is written because i have

79
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:02,299
no I mean I did not go to school at or I

80
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,769
mean like I didn't graduate with the

81
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,420
computer science degree so I have like

82
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,340
no idea how this stuff works like right

83
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,069
it's just all magical to me but I read a

84
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:11,959
lot and like I learned a lot of

85
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,389
assembler which is crazy like no one

86
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:16,789
should ever have to do that right but

87
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,889
then along the process like I wasn't

88
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:20,840
just reading about like assembler and

89
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,370
like how the Nintendo works like I read

90
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,470
a lot about music too because a lot of

91
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,510
that stuff Lee I had no idea how it

92
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,430
worked and then throughout the whole

93
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,849
process like I would go like

94
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:32,919
right assembler or write JavaScript and

95
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,569
figure out how this stuff was going to

96
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:37,149
work and figure out the API and all that

97
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:39,759
stuff and then what I would end up to do

98
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,369
doing was once I had something working I

99
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:48,039
would write music and try to like figure

100
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,439
out like does this make sense does this

101
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,749
work does this API like no and then I'd

102
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:54,249
go back and like be like oh that part

103
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:57,099
stupid like get rid of it or and so I'm

104
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,599
at a place now where it's like there's

105
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,849
some stuff that I don't like but it's I

106
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:04,389
think the API is decent enough to you

107
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,619
know present so what I have here that

108
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,119
I'm going to demo in just a little bit

109
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,800
after I kind of get through like the

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,219
basis of what this is is a assembler

111
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:17,379
sound engine so what happened was I was

112
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,959
like oh I want to make like this thing

113
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,639
makes sound so I went and I read a lot

114
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,159
and figured out how to do that with an

115
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,679
assembler I made a square channel like

116
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,199
beep it it just kind of went be you know

117
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,089
like square channel which I'll demo kind

118
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:36,759
of in a second then after like I went

119
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,379
through these tutorials on like these

120
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,110
nez developer forums and at the end of

121
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,879
the tutorials you kind of have a basic

122
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,309
working sound engine and assembler but

123
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:48,069
assembler is really difficult to work

124
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,919
with and you know it's not very fun to

125
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,229
write music and assembler just doesn't

126
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:58,180
like I don't know its assembler so take

127
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,279
once i had that though it was easy to

128
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,009
write a javascript api to that so they

129
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,009
could compile down to what the what I

130
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,639
saw would look like in assembler so

131
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,439
really quickly this thing has see how

132
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:17,369
many are there five yeah 5 5 channels

133
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:21,849
two squares a triangle noise which is

134
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,069
just random noise and a sampler which I

135
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:26,439
did not do the sampler because it takes

136
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,649
up a lot of memory and I didn't really

137
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:31,749
figure out how it works so I'm just

138
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:34,649
going to be working with these for now

139
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:39,579
so the square channel the features that

140
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:42,550
it have is a duty cycle which i'll show

141
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,899
a demo of it because a lot of this stuff

142
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:44,420
like

143
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,660
you don't like can't really visualize it

144
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,280
I guess you can visualize i defied like

145
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,340
a nozzle scope but I don't but it's

146
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,690
better just to listen to it so we'll

147
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,850
listen to it in a second but these are

148
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,890
the features didn't get frequency sweeps

149
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,000
working but here we go and I'll demo the

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,320
square can we get the demo thing going

151
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,960
okay so this is um this is the little

152
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,410
file system thing on the Nintendo that I

153
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,570
have going okay so here's a square this

154
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,190
is going to play a c-note and it's going

155
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,190
to go through the octave range of a

156
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:31,580
c-note on a square channel and that was

157
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,860
just doing like you know a for loop with

158
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,360
the number or something and just passing

159
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,790
that into like you know song dot square

160
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,580
and it's just an array of notes and it

161
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,040
plays it all right I got to reset this

162
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,720
sucker to get back oh one other thing

163
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,810
that I did I kind of skipped over duty

164
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,200
cycle and volume envelopes so duty cycle

165
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,550
um it kind of spaces out like or narrows

166
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,230
the the did we get this back oh sorry

167
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:14,930
can we get this yeah back sorry um its

168
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,550
faces out our narrows like the the

169
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,640
actual square how it looks and it

170
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,800
creates a different sound so just to

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,680
kind of this is the same note same

172
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,020
octave just change just manipulating the

173
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:33,880
duty cycle of of the square channel

174
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,409
okay so i got squared square stuff

175
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,440
working and it was beeping um the next

176
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,000
thing I did was like uh actually like

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,620
once I got the square channel working I

178
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,330
made that beep then I went to the sound

179
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,820
engine wrote the API to it and then I

180
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,709
wrote this thing which I don't it's just

181
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,200
some some notes and changing octaves and

182
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,880
this is just what it sounds like this

183
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,950
was the literally like the first thing I

184
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,110
wrote besides the beep so it doesn't

185
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:19,129
sound awesome at all but

186
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,360
Oh

187
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:32,550
all right ok cool so um so that yeah

188
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,560
that was a like that was the first thing

189
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,330
I wrote and then I started implementing

190
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,810
all these features volume envelopes if

191
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,100
you're not familiar with them like

192
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,590
imagine like a note is broken out into

193
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,950
like a bunch of frames and you have the

194
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,530
ability to say like on frame one of the

195
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:54,330
length of the note make the volume 0 and

196
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,670
that on a scale of 0 to like say 10 0

197
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,790
being off 10 being the loudest so so 0

198
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,890
it's off and then you gradually increase

199
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,480
it like frame 11 and then keep going to

200
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,060
25 5 10 and then it's the loudest so

201
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,860
then you have like you have created a

202
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,620
fade in effect so you can you can

203
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,390
manipulate these these notes with volume

204
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,860
envelopes to create like blip effects

205
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,090
like echo or staccato or fade ins fade

206
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,020
out all sorts of things um i don't think

207
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:34,450
i have a fade in demo but let's see oh

208
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,870
one other note is like square channels

209
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,690
the only one that can do that so with

210
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,880
triangle you have the ability to turn

211
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,590
volume on or off so you're pretty

212
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,390
limited I don't know why this is the

213
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,370
case but you can either say like hey

214
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,500
this is on it's just binary on or off

215
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,480
and you can use volume envelopes with

216
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,370
them but it'll just interpret any value

217
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,000
that's not zero as a one so triangle

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,850
it's it's made for like bass sounds for

219
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,560
the like the lower octaves really high

220
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,410
octaves it's the like flute sounds you

221
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,560
hear in like Zelda and stuff so here's

222
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,270
an example of it I don't remember I

223
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,440
think this is just the same as the

224
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,310
square it's just going through the

225
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:22,070
octaves of C so there we go triangle um

226
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,320
knows I don't really know how to explain

227
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,400
this because it doesn't really matter

228
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,930
music very well it's it sounds like

229
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,920
drums some

230
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,139
you can get like certain ones sound like

231
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:38,019
hi hats or snares or like bass drums and

232
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:41,050
stuff but for musical or for like

233
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,060
musical notation I didn't know actually

234
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,190
how to represent this so this was one of

235
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,079
the problems I had but here's like the

236
00:11:47,079 --> 00:12:02,889
full no noise range that you have so so

237
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,480
then with like those sounds you can

238
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,370
create drums and this is kind of a

239
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:18,660
really dumb like simple drum beat okay

240
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,079
okay so techniques so all the channels

241
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,720
on here are monophonic so you can't you

242
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,320
can only play one note at a time you you

243
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,260
can't you can't make chords so what

244
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,570
people would do composers of the 80's

245
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,390
would they would fake it like they would

246
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,940
make arpeggios and speed them up super

247
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,940
fast like increased the the like the

248
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,630
timing of the note or or speed the tempo

249
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,829
up a lot of like the Japanese games and

250
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:52,870
stuff they were just written like if you

251
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,399
listen to a lot of video game music it's

252
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,620
just written monophonic Lee some of the

253
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,290
Commodore 64 people would would use the

254
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,880
arpeggio technique but let's let's go

255
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,890
through some some songs before I go

256
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,730
forward so I was having trouble like uh

257
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,089
I was trying to like do 80 some 80's

258
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:15,970
musics for jfcom given the theme so I

259
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,730
did Billie Jean just the baseline though

260
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,980
because the square doesn't really sound

261
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,959
that or I couldn't get it to sound super

262
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,730
good so this is just the baseline it's

263
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,970
really simple let's see if it sounds

264
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,540
decent

265
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:36,639
you

266
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,209
that's it that's that's the whole song

267
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:43,470
pretty much and the the square channel

268
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,729
would be like that burn burn but yeah

269
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:50,489
okay so let's go so then I kind of went

270
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:52,109
through like a bunch of songs like I

271
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:53,849
tried a bunch of different types of

272
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,470
music before I talked to like actual

273
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,599
people that compose music and they gave

274
00:13:57,599 --> 00:14:00,089
me some pointers so I was like oh I like

275
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,429
Slayer and I like raining blood that

276
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:04,799
must be an awesome song to do but it's

277
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,229
not really because it's actually really

278
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:22,830
boring pretty much I like

279
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,449
it's just dropped me over and over again

280
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,800
there's that little part in the middle

281
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:37,010
but

282
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,590
okay so Slayer was boring like a lot of

283
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,990
yeah I mean drop D over and over again

284
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,710
does not sound good on the Nintendo um

285
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,070
so I was like okay I'm going to like

286
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,270
take it take a crack at rewriting Super

287
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:30,850
Mario track so I came up with this so

288
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,530
that one that one actually worked out

289
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,600
really well I was much happier with that

290
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,220
than Slayer and yeah so then after

291
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,930
talking to some people and showing them

292
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,490
what I had though I was I was kind of

293
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,660
like yeah here's the problem i'm having

294
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,630
like all these songs have cords and it

295
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,180
doesn't like it usually doesn't sound

296
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,490
good and there's a couple cases where I

297
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,850
did get cords to kind of sound good but

298
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,030
I don't know like what what I did

299
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,010
instead of doing the arpeggio technique

300
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,630
because I could almost never get that to

301
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,940
sound okay is I was actually talking to

302
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,230
my brother and he's like just used power

303
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,790
chords because you have to square

304
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,740
channels so you can just use the tune

305
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,510
and that kind of worked but it still

306
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,610
wasn't didn't seem right but then I was

307
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,310
talking to a composer friend of mine and

308
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,130
he was like you should check out the and

309
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,260
I forgot what they're called out but

310
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,370
these bak pieces bwv 847 i think is the

311
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,600
prelude in c minor and 851 is d minor I

312
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,850
didn't finish these and they're kind of

313
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,110
long so i won't play them all but

314
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,970
they're really great because they're

315
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,130
mostly monophonic so they've mapped

316
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,860
really well with to the nintendo and i

317
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,620
have volume envelopes so i can make them

318
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,650
play at staccato which is what like

319
00:16:44,650 --> 00:17:10,910
Glenn Gould and stuff plays a map

320
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,250
member okay it's more of that it's just

321
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,449
yeah um so yeah here's really quickly

322
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:21,400
this is just the first couple bars of

323
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:33,850
the D minor one so those work really

324
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,470
really well because they're monophonic

325
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,570
and there's the sense there's no cords

326
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,820
it's it's just it makes sense right I

327
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,799
can use if you're like reading music you

328
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,290
can use like for the bass clef you can

329
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,820
just use a triangle channel and then for

330
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,610
if you have like notes up top you can

331
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,590
use square or even mix them up or

332
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:57,280
whatever um okay great so that's that's

333
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,280
kind of like what I have so moving

334
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,150
forward though going back over I guess

335
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,730
to here is the future like what do I

336
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,260
want to do with this i have this API I

337
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,820
have this module that's on mpm that can

338
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,669
take JavaScript and produce these these

339
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:21,730
songs in the in the end they're still

340
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,860
it's mostly JavaScript there's this last

341
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,770
piece the assembler itself is actually a

342
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,570
c++ assembler but I think that that

343
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,299
evening can be moved to JavaScript and

344
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,380
there's already people that have

345
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,500
JavaScript assemblers for the Nintendo

346
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,799
so it's it's not that much of a jump to

347
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,030
to get there so I think we can get a nes

348
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,910
assembler in j/s that one module that

349
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,320
you can just say hey here's some

350
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,450
assembler give me a Nintendo program

351
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,850
and that would that would be awesome and

352
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,990
then I think also with this API we can

353
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,800
build web UI tools that since you have

354
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,280
an assembler in Jas and you have this

355
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,250
stuff that I wrote in j/s you can say

356
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,440
here's like here's the sequence of

357
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,360
sounds like click a button or whatever

358
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,730
it builds it it outputs your assembler

359
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,210
it assembles it gives you a actual

360
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,250
Nintendo program and then you have

361
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,340
things like people have written

362
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,900
emulators in JavaScript for Nintendo

363
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,580
right i mean i'm sure we see these

364
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,740
things don't pop up on all of the new

365
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,750
sites and whatever over the last five

366
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,410
years so you have your whole like build

367
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,080
environment in j s and you just need to

368
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,970
piece it together and get it in the

369
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,010
browser and we can have this really

370
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:47,170
awesome like authentic sounding thing to

371
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,910
make a bit music so yeah I don't even

372
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,370
know how much time I have because this

373
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,800
thing's not going but I can keep talking

374
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:04,960
about this stuff okay cool so um so let

375
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,450
me go back to like why to the why of

376
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,090
like how I got started into this stuff

377
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,830
so I had previously written like

378
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,360
graphical stuff and it for this and I

379
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,880
gave some some talks like writing slides

380
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,140
and stuff on on the Nintendo itself and

381
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,200
that was super hard and I didn't do a

382
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,700
very good job at like the graphical

383
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,110
stuff like I had a lot of problems with

384
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,850
it it was a lot of like stuff that was

385
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,270
hacked together and then I can't

386
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,430
remember where it was but I gave a I was

387
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,350
giving a talk in the AV person came up

388
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,430
to me and they said oh are you going to

389
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,890
need sound to the Nintendo and I thought

390
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,990
oh no I won't meet sound I don't have

391
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,850
any sound and I was thinking about it a

392
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,440
little bit later and I was like why

393
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,240
don't i sound like why didn't i get it

394
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,310
why didn't i read that part about sound

395
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,600
so I thought like I should go back and

396
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,789
figure out how sound

397
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:07,289
works and it was just that curiosity

398
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:09,690
like that in the back of my mind like oh

399
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,759
how does this work and stuff so I went

400
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,789
back and there's there's a lot of stuff

401
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:17,159
that's written about the Nintendo that's

402
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,889
out there but there's not a whole lot of

403
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:24,029
practical examples so finding like this

404
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,220
to this sound tutorial and kind of

405
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,809
standing on the shoulder of giants and

406
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:30,419
like taking this the stuff that this

407
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,879
these other people have have written and

408
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:35,220
using that as a basis for like saying

409
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,590
hey like I could just write a JavaScript

410
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,479
API to this and I know JavaScript well

411
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,849
enough that I can expose this so that

412
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:45,529
other people can use use this stuff and

413
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:50,099
and yeah so I got to that point and it

414
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:53,879
it was actually way way easier than all

415
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,529
the graphical stuff the sound stuff was

416
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,570
a piece of cake compared to the

417
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,269
graphical stuff and I think like a lot

418
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:03,090
of this stuff is still relevant today I

419
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,279
mean you have bands like autumn on

420
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,279
Iguchi that actually use like a Nintendo

421
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,210
in their set or like in their music they

422
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,249
use it as an instrument it's an

423
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,169
instrument that has these channels that

424
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,330
you're able to manipulate sound and get

425
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,779
like a real authentic sound and there's

426
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:24,419
actually a game that for Nintendo that

427
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:25,950
was released like a couple months ago

428
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,070
called star versus and you can buy this

429
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,349
game for like 40 bucks or whatever and

430
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,210
they give you a real cartridge like a

431
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,859
real Nintendo cartridge and that is so

432
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,690
cool that people are still hacking on it

433
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,399
and selling games and stuff so I think

434
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,320
this is like this stuff is really really

435
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,580
awesome and and so yeah I want um I want

436
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,139
everybody to just like you know if

437
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:47,989

00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,570
and building building musical stuff and

441

cool thank you
