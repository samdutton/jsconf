1
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,960

two minutes

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:39,560
a very special

3
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,310
they would

4
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,110
you'll find something that looks for

5
00:00:45,110 --> 00:01:04,360
instance like this maybe not

6
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,640
you have this do X variety of stability

7
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,680
polynomial yes doing is everything is no

8
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,460
visual details that is certified

9
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,110
accessibility internationalized and

10
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,240
proposals on

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,520
which is visual like the hell predators

12
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,920
it's part when love is a mighty not

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,290
working any ID the most impersonal

14
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,159
process most

15
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,310
possession

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:02:00,280
quite severe

17
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,150
they going to a certainty

18
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,280
and each of these voters have their own

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,550
doona test which can basically but it's

20
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,620
not as easy as making love can be quite

21
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,660
hard the idea is that you can really

22
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,610
cover these and months ago that it will

23
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,770
induce most basic for your examples so

24
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,850
if you see something interesting just

25
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:29,960
grab it on the truck I'll the supported

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,200
platforms

27
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,810
working process there the some things

28
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,189
the friendly

29
00:02:47,189 --> 00:03:00,520
well but in normal reference

30
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:15,980
is class for

31
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:25,100
sort of movement and the way

32
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,560
from

33
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,160
words in ladies

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,680
and

35
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:41,660
and the particle beams

36
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,550
go in graphics will take times when

37
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,180
running and

38
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,330
is that

39
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,920
customers installations and yard

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,600
four sequences

41
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:06,130
right

42
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,540
that was

43
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:17,520
or not

44
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,680
so where is the eye can see light and

45
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,210
the judgment is

46
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:38,340
in order to practice in my phone

47
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,460
so

48
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,060
whimpers

49
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,350
perhaps you're using a desk in

50
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,200
environments and using kinda like a

51
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,660
moving service and boy times the

52
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:00,420
difficulties of because I see

53
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,930
nestles is kind of very short of desire

54
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,639
vegas by plans

55
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,969
fire department vs bus and there are

56
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,710
editors do that or you just put it right

57
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,889
into daughter GFX if you want so

58
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:34,689
everything begins with a surface

59
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:54,100
hair that most Africa

60
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,530
fun so you're busy

61
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,029
inches

62
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:05,030
the right composer is it okay sir

63
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,680
right through the space base

64
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,959
I

65
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,530
yeah nice

66
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,310
that were estimated oh you when I fix

67
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,640
the code so you can do quite nice things

68
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,320
the thing that you did not see looks

69
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:38,550
like this useful services looks like

70
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,739
here I service

71
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:45,969
here we go

72
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:54,750
by these things

73
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:04,940
great service

74
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,340
pencils are we

75
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,920
mr.

76
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:22,660
this one where

77
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,230
and also if you have any questions

78
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,480
please interrupt me immediately I don't

79
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
have to say because you always forget to

80
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,170
the last minute what to our school I

81
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,690
directly so and if you have this surface

82
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,890
ships are regular server waves like

83
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,890
Providence and this hall hundred

84
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:52,080
straight down

85
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,700
just

86
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,200
worse

87
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,280
and even weather has also very nice mr.

88
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,940
for this

89
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,090
what

90
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,020
wrong and

91
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,909
we have seamless

92
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,550
they don't know

93
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,590
producers

94
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,900
so

95
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,639
if you have a very very picky client

96
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,470
this is one way of us on that problem

97
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,169
and all that the cords the text the

98
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:35,800
functions are for absence

99
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:41,550
there's another place

100
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,460
works thanks but

101
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,639
that's a quick look at this time

102
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,830
my name is very good

103
00:08:53,830 --> 00:09:00,569
so

104
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:04,199
there is a

105
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:07,540
let's see there are several programs

106
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,689
there's one called to put a little

107
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:12,819
blooper dupa dupa tub inkscape vector

108
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,279
graphics editor where can actually draw

109
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,629
stuff import them and fill with them and

110
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,310
respond to see how this

111
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,890
there is no class ring as I did actually

112
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:34,560
him to this kind of crap odd stuff and

113
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,220
there's a demo

114
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,680
using circles here we have 100 random

115
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,060
eye circles and free circle I've created

116
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:55,890
a movable object that makes or draggable

117
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,050
and to the strike of the object i canna

118
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:08,980
see you driving under this was kind of

119
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,200
beautiful and it's really simple to do a

120
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,370
sew in the my weight I think I have some

121
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,080
kind of residence here with my voice I

122
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,370
try to speak more more in a light voice

123
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:33,110
no didn't help either

124
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,019
greatest

125
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:46,350
and for the service

126
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,400
NJ

127
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,180
or where

128
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:59,420
even said that same study

129
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:06,680
and what

130
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,970
they're complex objects is writing the

131
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:25,270
things of the sort of

132
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:42,440
but it looks this is one example

133
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,450
our key

134
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,990
and we're going to values that we find

135
00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:05,920
there

136
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,870
this is universal

137
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:23,410
x

138
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,880
and we also have the normal kind of them

139
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:36,810
work has work

140
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,250
Andy what there is something more

141
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:45,410
slightly more interesting we can't my

142
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,320
thing well that was that one

143
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,010
for her supper

144
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,740
we can use the five days ago ancestor

145
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,720
gets on the percent of legibility and

146
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,000
this of course the much much slower in

147
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,640
his for safety password so in your

148
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,089
simple things or amex starfish

149
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,420
okay you can probably work stuff from

150
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,240
flash or C++ or Java or small language

151
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,610
they find these cool devices don't bite

152
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,680
to it because the graphics API are very

153
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:26,610
similar and the code for that is

154
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,710
about here

155
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:40,340
no questions of work

156
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,510
okay um then we go to the next part

157
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,440
that's there and I mentioned this before

158
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,990
them you ever say

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:05,470
second call came so soon a

160
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,970
stay Pacific missions we need

161
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,739
confirmation students

162
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,920
so

163
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:24,360
Oh

164
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,679
I

165
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:31,510
always available

166
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:40,020
and I even think about this is we have a

167
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,510
quite lot of documentation in the Doyle

168
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,700
campus so if you go to tops off work

169
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,170
amazon for the last year and norms of

170
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,020
effort

171
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,770
examples of how to cook days as a link

172
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,430
just described yes

173
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:10,510
and this door campus is riddled with

174
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:16,240
these kind of the resonating voices it's

175
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,610
through these kind of squares that are

176
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,350
really you know you have a demo your

177
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,240
copy and paste what's you have a spread

178
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,779
which day summer was to CSS so for

179
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,279
everything that you would like to show

180
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,670
this agree the kind of femur not

181
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,430
everything is turned on you can use this

182
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,890
for player of these inversions of oreos

183
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:52,750
so their camps is real nice

184
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:05,349
then again you might

185
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:09,629
nations to them to have powerful objects

186
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:23,530
than whatever say the same time

187
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,060
dancing

188
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,740
ever bring to form bring your phone to

189
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,720
bring tobacco for all of the excitement

190
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:37,700
or inside

191
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,280
Endora convey some of noisy for their

192
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,290
party were

193
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,630
other ways then

194
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,829
as I say

195
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:05,970
so

196
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:13,529
you have a shape stroke definitions

197
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:17,630
you

198
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,430
office lips

199
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:33,820
so

200
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,380
so moving on to events animations I

201
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,000
didn't really really simple example

202
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:51,140
for years of service and

203
00:17:51,150 --> 00:18:02,460
and

204
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,340
this

205
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,760
this low voltage is actually a kind of

206
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:23,960
the force the habit

207
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,430
and it will

208
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,789
this so when I move over this is it

209
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:35,200
creates very nice and then kind of

210
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,080
watery feeling where it wouldn't it I

211
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,759
didn't have time to do anything else

212
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,259
with this december's some horses and

213
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:45,399
what's happening here is what i call

214
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:50,230
this public function i have an animation

215
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,230
going and this animation was something

216
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,840
that Nicolae touched upon the event

217
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,419
yesterday today's elimination packages

218
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,000
that are separated what's work on just

219
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,299
using harsh movements so this kind of

220
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,669
not bouncy effect is used elsewhere for

221
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:09,879
bottoms wood or menus would have shown

222
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:13,090
in the animation in separate that we

223
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,250
have a whole slew of so it's a very good

224
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,059
separation of concern on that aspect

225
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:23,559
actually see and the function that is

226
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:29,720
using these is they're from

227
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,860
kind of

228
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,320
destinations

229
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:54,619
really

230
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:58,780
40

231
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:18,080
and

232
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,950
looks kind of wave is really kind of

233
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:25,820
unaware we have weird questions

234
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:33,059
wonderful another some an enormous

235
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,559
amount of effort has gone into the next

236
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,340
example but I wish already that's it

237
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,440
because how do you see what I showed I

238
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,080
had this customer in New York who wanted

239
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,570
a process visualization assist I was

240
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,549
really impressed by the coding every I

241
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,289
the Novus transport and it worked very

242
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,230
well but when you show it gesture hey so

243
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,010
wait we'll have this another oh maybe I

244
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:09,980
have an idea this is

245
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,760
usher in the Red Square at population

246
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,890
this project is argue but they are

247
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,300
spread everything

248
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,580
graphics and early

249
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,600
side this time 50 grams there's no

250
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,659
just because

251
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:35,799
so until i have i use these events to

252
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,620
anime so give some feedback and when i

253
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,970
click on one mode use a little circular

254
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:51,120
very common dialog this text another

255
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,900
I was dirty from the world

256
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:00,360
and the continuity is the end it really

257
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,800
looks very stern design-wise so this is

258
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,750
the specification from the customer this

259
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,820
is not really my idea that it should

260
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,179
look like this but which is possible and

261
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:18,610
I was not and that's it six month

262
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,160
of time work that we realized

263
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,320
I couldn't have ever heard of a toy I

264
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,430
mean because I'm constrained by the

265
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:40,490
module system so I load up there to sort

266
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,280
of at them and then we're moving into

267
00:22:45,280 --> 00:23:04,359
shorting and this my contract package

268
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:09,880
and what to expect for a bamboo

269
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,150
updates i express my expertise and one

270
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:22,369
positive things

271
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:27,500
turtle backwards the worst

272
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,330
and let's say you would like to have a

273
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:38,000
short there's some concede media

274
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,370
absolutely the game next up we can years

275
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,320
ago

276
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:56,970
tractor

277
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,020
the first mine

278
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:13,210
motion

279
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,200
what I said

280
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:22,669
graphics that are zooming soldiers and

281
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,700
it was shortly use

282
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:31,930
see you know

283
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,790
and that's kind of mystical so

284
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,879
double-time understand

285
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:44,220
just because you have

286
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,759
from very simple

287
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,049
but just

288
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:52,530
John

289
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,330
here's the lease

290
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:01,250
some of that's he may charge

291
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:12,460
add both just notice even my shot

292
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:20,680
I'll get access exim by this is named

293
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,520
we

294
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,060
ever made minor michael takes this

295
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,580
algorithm

296
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:42,010
this

297
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,370
data and this

298
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:49,169
Pegasus

299
00:25:49,179 --> 00:26:11,880
survey

300
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,480
that

301
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:31,640
vessels yes

302
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:37,520
this

303
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,760
person

304
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,710
there's a service

305
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:54,340
sir

306
00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:06,420
person

307
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,830
oddly they did you know be a URL for

308
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:16,040
that ok so but we have all days ok but

309
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,450
it was a very good idea i'll try that

310
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:29,410
see

311
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:37,190
Oh

312
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:47,020
I'm not sure I'm ready to find that

313
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,980
this is

314
00:27:49,990 --> 00:28:03,500
ribbit are respectable score

315
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,730
we have an end a local team actually I

316
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,380
was going to show that it's not using

317
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,390
not a communicator with the servers

318
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,250
using a store in very much the same way

319
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:26,730
so maybe we can take a look at that

320
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,630
and we go to the unit tests again so

321
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,920
these are just a normal test that is

322
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,600
used but all your data

323
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:43,750
so if I changed something here

324
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,880
then he should update

325
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:59,539
we didn't take that it

326
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:07,460
so it's

327
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:20,890
otherwise

328
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,870
one

329
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:34,570
and there's quite a number of it across

330
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,080
arias course I think the easiest ways to

331
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:48,029
just show you these from a d-mail

332
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,940
it's a basic short

333
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,529
more fancy one a speedy

334
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:58,479
Thanks we also have a small we'd get

335
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:06,970
called a vertical it a legend so if you

336
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,830
have another series added the legend

337
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,590
will detect a series of amazement at

338
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,080
this rate this is very sweet and you

339
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,100
probably want to do that so and we have

340
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,409
the eventing stuff automatically tied in

341
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:29,900
to can say that you want to switch

342
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:34,060
which kind of data so these are stacked

343
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:42,730
bars and Collins different shapes your

344
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,470
free series

345
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,059
it was very refreshing to play around if

346
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:55,500
you climb them and we have also

347
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,650
here's another theme I think you can

348
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:11,299
actually no it's up here but

349
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:14,040
they are

350
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:26,880
the second

351
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,559
not using

352
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,699
one is almost

353
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:45,169
there was

354
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,240
this

355
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,040
workers even

356
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,760
song

357
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:00,019
Oh

358
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:02,609
I have shadows and lots of really doing

359
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:03,840
it doesn't matter how many charts will

360
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,039
make it is always fun with his head

361
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,789
don't have this kind of spider shark and

362
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:11,009
we don't but there are the kind of

363
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:17,980
shocked Spencer

364
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,690
another interesting feature is that you

365
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,520
can take a short and you can scale it

366
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:30,770
and you can pan inside the short and

367
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,570
this of course an edge case can be seen

368
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,770
i think is still pelikula where

369
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:41,970
they become

370
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,419
that's really great of a certain kind of

371
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:50,120
the customers applications okay we can

372
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:59,880
also have multiple access that's also

373
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:05,740
Maya

374
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:10,350
and maybe a time series you don't want

375
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:18,230
to show the actual value very

376
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,210
here's here's

377
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:29,360
sir

378
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:36,800
conscious as well

379
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,070
and all of this is quite fine because do

380
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:48,640
you want to start the translation enemy

381
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,690
I'm not comfortable with this room I

382
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,010
think

383
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,900
and I does know about the date on the

384
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,780
find out that the easiest ways is hardly

385
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,900
the HMO very costly and sometimes you do

386
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:13,490

448
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,550
actually like to see exactly that's kind

449
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:01,080
of a PCO can start to move around we

450
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,660

451
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,140

452
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,420
right thank you we have that sorry just

453
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,750
in from but we let's say drawing and we

454
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,210
have the unit us from that I think and

455
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:27,749
they say path test no wait

456
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:31,709
there we go so a visit here and this

457
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:39,170
here is this the right BMO

458
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,980
yeah but if we have some kind of

459
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,760
connector here we are I don't know how

460
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,650
to connect this to another object i'm

461
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,510
not certain whether it's worse that at

462
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:58,570
the moment

463
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,130
you

464
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,510
problems that

465
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:07,610
with Holly

466
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:29,240
a special duty

467
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,710

00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:37,770
Americans below an 80 minute response I

469
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:41,200
don't even want witters so it's really

470
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,450
quite a lot but I think there is we just

471
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:51,250
quickly quickly go to back yeah but I

472
00:42:51,250 --> 00:43:06,440
remember that we have one

473
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,599
here's one very simple example yeah so

474
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,820

475
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,319
a loon years

476
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:21,250
rear ender realism

477
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,270
