[Music]

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,760
Thanks

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,410
how is everybody are you still tired

4
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,450
thanks John

5
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,490
so I'm gonna do how to talk to Hardware

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,249
JavaScript firmware in 30 minutes which

7
00:00:33,249 --> 00:00:36,309
is a tall order so please forgive me if

8
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:38,710
I speed through some concept or if I

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,980
abbreviate like I won't go over all of

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,839
how you do firmware in JavaScript in 30

11
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:47,050
minutes this is actually kind of a hard

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,609
concept for a lot of people including

13
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,980
experienced engineers so if there's

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,050
anything in here that just completely

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,530
flies by that I say really fast or that

16
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,370
you haven't been introduced to you

17
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,139
before I won't probably have time for

18
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,899
Q&A here but please approach me

19
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,309
afterwards if there's something you want

20
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,110
to learn more about I would be delighted

21
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,680
to fill in the gaps on what I didn't

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,030
have time for in here so I'm kelcie as

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,369
CJ mentioned I am one of the creators of

24
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:19,030
this thing called the tehsil which you

25
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,729
can basically think of as a node API for

26
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,560
the physical world and today we're going

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,810
to solve a problem and the problem that

28
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,640
we're gonna solve is I want my project

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,189
to be able to tell me whether it is

30
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,509
oriented right-side up or if I flip it

31
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:36,399
over and it's right side down and I lost

32
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,030
all my probes don't worry about that

33
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,590
so today's talk is not about tehsil it

34
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,909
includes a tehsil for the sake of

35
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,380
convenience because I want to write my

36
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,920
firmware in JavaScript but this is what

37
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,630
it looks like to solve my problem with

38
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,259
tehsil I've got two node requires I say

39
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:59,020
that I'm going to use this Tussle thing

40
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,609
I'm going to plug in this accelerometer

41
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:03,039
module in 4a and when it gives me data

42
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,039
I'm going to print it out and because

43
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,020
acceleration as you all know is a

44
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,000
constant down or because gravity is a

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,550
constant downward acceleration I'll get

46
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,440
a different z-axis

47
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,930
sign negative versus positive if I'm

48
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,010
like this versus like that we were like

49
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,920
one minute into my talk so that's why

50
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,209
I'm not telling you about tussle today

51
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:29,920
because it's much more interesting if we

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,739
take a look further in and don't use the

53
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,230
api's that we've already written so what

54
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,209
I'm gonna do is show you the basics of

55
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,930
how we go from a piece of hardware like

56
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,930
this with this little black chip on it

57
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,290
the Mme 84 accelerometer how we look at

58
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,390
the datasheet and interpret the signals

59
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,640
and talk to it in order to get useful

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,090
information so if you look at the full

61
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,489
stack which is not in this case a mean

62
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,380
stack we're gonna talk today basically

63
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,620
from signals on a wire to zeros and ones

64
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,090
binary and Hexen ting information in

65
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,930
English and if any of you are able to

66
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,370
come to the workshop tomorrow I think it

67
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,670
might be full but essentially pay

68
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,290
attention because we're gonna make you

69
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,390
do this tomorrow so jumping right in how

70
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,579
talking to hardware works there are many

71
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,260
ways that a signal can play on a wire

72
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,700
you've got your analog you've got your

73
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,890
pulse width modulation today we're only

74
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,630
going to talk about digital signals and

75
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,329
the reason for that is a microcontroller

76
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,820
will typically use just a digital signal

77
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,130
it's very simple it's either on or it's

78
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,209
off right and this is the

79
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,930
microcontroller trip on here and that's

80
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,920
what it speaks is ones and zeros so we

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,709
need to figure out how to use ones and

82
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,359
zeros to convey more information than

83
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:02,579
just on and off because we only have

84
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,680
that very simple information we have to

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,410
add the third dimension of time right

86
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,959
and take you all are probably familiar

87
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,810
with Morse code what we use as

88
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,180
communication protocols so a toggle ones

89
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,250
and zeroes with specific timing on

90
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,859
specific wires in encoding so that

91
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,890
create messages that are more complex so

92
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,570
for example over here in this diagram

93
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,370
this is using a

94
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,990
wrote a call called spy which we aren't

95
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,780
going to use for this accelerometer but

96
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,560
it's got four different wires clock one

97
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,840
that talks from the master device to the

98
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,280
slave device I apologize for the

99
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
terminology it's like ingrained in here

100
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,880
but it means that this device has

101
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800
complete control and this device has no

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,530
control and so we've got one where the

103
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,150
master device talks to the slave and one

104
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,740
where the slave device responds to the

105
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,680
master and this other line which I won't

106
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,590
go into right now different protocols

107
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,970
use different numbers of wires and

108
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,240
different specific and coatings so let's

109
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,770
try one so this is a different one this

110
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,039
is called UART also known as serial and

111
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,530
what we're gonna do is we're gonna send

112
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,840
the words hello world over the wire here

113
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,680
hold on I lost all my probes when I

114
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,030
picked this up so you get to watch me

115
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:33,460
painfully attach this

116
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,530
alright so cereal is a protocol that

117
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,020
uses two wires and the third wire is

118
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:48,030
just ground which you need in everything

119
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,210
so by the way the device that I'm

120
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,710
hooking in is called a logic analyzer

121
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,450
and this is a really nice one it's by

122
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,680
this company called sale ei and what a

123
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,650
logic analyzer does is it lets you have

124
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,080
a look specifically at what the signals

125
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,470
are saying on the pins so you actually

126
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,670
get to watch and record the message is

127
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,230
that it's sending and it even does stuff

128
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,790
like interpret it and I'll show you in a

129
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,540
second

130
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:21,270
I think that's come on

131
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,710
sorry Hardware on stages like this at

132
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:31,630
the best of times there we go alright so

133
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,360
what I'm going to do essentially what

134
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,680
we're taking is a a message and we're

135
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,990
sending it from the tehsil and

136
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,790
communicating it outward and in this

137
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,440
case I don't even have a microchip

138
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,419
attached to it so it's not communicating

139
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,250
with anything except for this logic

140
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,440
analyzer here and the important bit is

141
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,180
what I'm showing here is this is the

142
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,330
JavaScript code I'm going to send and

143
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,570
this stuff over here is settings in the

144
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,800
logic analyzer which is over here

145
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,000
which tell it how to interpret it and

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,560
the important part is that they match

147
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,970
right so here we've got data bits 8 baud

148
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,040
rate this is the speed at which it's

149
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,070
sent and you can see that we've got the

150
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,150
same baud rate at 8 bits etc if we had

151
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,500
more time I'd tell you what those mean

152
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,940
but it honestly doesn't matter very much

153
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,840
in this context so what I'm going to do

154
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:34,460
is run this code and at the same time

155
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,100
I'm going to capture it and so this is

156
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,390
going to wait for something to happen

157
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,560
over on the tehsil and I've set it so

158
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,510
that when channel 3 which is this orange

159
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,969
wire goes high it'll

160
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:50,659
collecting samples so it's found my

161
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,519
tussle and it's writing and it's running

162
00:07:52,519 --> 00:08:06,639
and oh oh something's not connected oops

163
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,659
that's what you get uploaded in

164
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:23,909
backwards

165
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,429
I'll try that again

166
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:37,819
right connected writing running waiting

167
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:42,159
for trigger and it took samples perfect

168
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,050
so I can pause it early and so what you

169
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,819
can see here is we've got this async

170
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:54,079
serial wine something happened to start

171
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,399
it so that was the initialization of the

172
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,470
code when I required tehsil and if we

173
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,110
zoom way in we can see that some up and

174
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,550
down motion happened and that's the ones

175
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,769
and zeros and if you zoom even further

176
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:06,019
in you probably can't read this very

177
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,149
well because this program doesn't let

178
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,670
you change font sizes but it says hello

179
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,600
world and I will take a screenshot and

180
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:25,250
let you see and bigger yeah so that's

181
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,750
pretty cool right now I've seen how you

182
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,310
can take ones and zeros and really

183
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,899
obscure looking bits like this and over

184
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:39,410
a wire talk to something getting back to

185
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,689
our problem solving so we want to

186
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:43,160
determine whether this is upside down or

187
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,720
right side up right so I mentioned this

188
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,880
earlier very briefly but the easiest

189
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,040
thing to do to determine right side up

190
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,670
and upside down is to find gravity one

191
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,930
of the fun bits about working with

192
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,490
hardware is that you get to choose your

193
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,930
different sensors right so you could do

194
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,860
this in a bunch of different ways you

195
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,620
could have some kind of electronic level

196
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,959
or you could have some like magnetic

197
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,279
switch that teaches it what's

198
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,079
upside-down up right side up you could

199
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,060
have a light sensor that gets covered if

200
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,670
it gets flipped over but what I've

201
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,459
decided is the most reliable and what

202
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,380
your smartphone manufacturers have also

203
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,809
decided this the right answer is an

204
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,639
accelerometer because you can very

205
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,889
consistently get the direction of

206
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:27,920
gravity right so in your smartphone it's

207
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,079
the thing that lets your phone know

208
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,029
whether it's portrait or landscape it's

209
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:34,819
just an accelerometer finding gravity so

210
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:37,639
we're gonna do that use an accelerometer

211
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,250
and because I want to use JavaScript and

212
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,870
because maybe in the future I want my

213
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,170
project to have internet connect

214
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:48,660
I'm gonna write on a tehsil - so how do

215
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,339
I actually do that so I've taken this

216
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,320
thing here so this is my accelerometer

217
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,170
module which is tehsils but what I'm

218
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,000
actually gonna try and talk to is this

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,160
little black chip and if you look really

220
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,260
close on it in tiny tiny font which you

221
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,620
definitely can't read it says Mme 84

222
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,860
which is it's part number and this whole

223
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,570
red board is what's called a breakout

224
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,519
board and it just makes it easier for it

225
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,170
to get plugged in and it's got a couple

226
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,000
of resistors and capacitors that it can

227
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,850
handle charge so it can have the right

228
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,190
address which will talk to you a bit so

229
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,269
what we're looking at is that little

230
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:25,320
back black bit and as you can see here

231
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,839
it looks like this and it has this

232
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,089
datasheet it's pretty cool hardware bits

233
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,570
come with manuals in the general case

234
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,459
what's sort of unfortunate and also nice

235
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,820
is that it's a 54 page document that you

236
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,320
have to look through and the thing is

237
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,430
you actually have to read the whole

238
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,160
thing if you're gonna do this stuff it's

239
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,930
a really good idea to actually read the

240
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,820
entire data sheet I won't make you

241
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,910
read the entire thing but I'll show it

242
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,459
to you here and we're gonna reference it

243
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:57,660
during this talk there's a bunch of

244
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,709
different stuff in here it talks about

245
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,550
you know here's what each of the

246
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,160
different pins do it's got a table of

247
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,740
contents it tells you exactly how it's

248
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,670
gonna work

249
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,649
talking about earth gravity which we've

250
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:13,980
talked about ourselves basically

251
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,570
everything you could possibly want to

252
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,010
know about this part is supposed to be

253
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,709
in this document so the first thing you

254
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,899
want to figure out is how does this talk

255
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,140
to this and this is looking for our

256
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,220
communication protocol so we already saw

257
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,709
cereal we saw spy

258
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,290
this one has i2c and how do I know that

259
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,880
because it says so in the table of

260
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,260
contents so I know that I need I to see

261
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,480
then I need to talk from the JavaScript

262
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,829
side so I go to Tesla dot io / Docs and

263
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:48,420
it redirects over here a look in

264
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,430
Hardware API and find I to see right so

265
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,649
we need to be able to specify from both

266
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,540
directions

267
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,330
so that as remember when we had the the

268
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,720
baud rate remember when we had the baud

269
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,580
rate of one one five two hundred and

270
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,440
eight data bits and all that sort of

271
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,890
stuff

272
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,940
we need the same sort of stuff for ITC

273
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,899
but a little different because it's a

274
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,540
different protocol so in the case of I D

275
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,700
I to see each hardware thing will have a

276
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,540
built in address and in this case the

277
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:28,020
address is in this case the address for

278
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,550
the accelerometer which you can find the

279
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,959
datasheet but I won't dig through it for

280
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,310
the sake of your time is 0 x1 D so we're

281
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,920
then going to initialize I to C is a new

282
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,440
I to seaport on port a and we're gonna

283
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,630
do the very first thing that you

284
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,640
typically will do is that there should

285
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,980
be a Who am I so this is a this is a

286
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,420
thing that lets you say well I've hooked

287
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,860
it up correctly and my software

288
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,110
communication is set to the appropriate

289
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,959
levels right so I've just plugged in the

290
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,440
accelerometer on port a and I'm going to

291
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,450
need to move this over to read on this

292
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:15,750
the i2c lines which are SCL and SDA one

293
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,040
of them is clock and the other one is

294
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:31,830
data

295
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,790
make a really confused face if you're

296
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,029
lost okay you all see them either fine

297
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:47,580
or asleep

298
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,950
okay cool so I'm gonna do the hello

299
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,510
world for this particular part which is

300
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,060
not writing the words hello world onto

301
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,090
it but actually looking for this thing

302
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,020
called Who am I

303
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,060
which you can find in the datasheet one

304
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,529
of the most useful bits of the datasheet

305
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:05,560
is this thing called register

306
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,240
descriptions and it tells me if I want

307
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,830
to get different kinds of data like

308
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,060
status or out X or out Z or Who am I it

309
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,580
says that the address of the register

310
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,950
that has that information is here at 0

311
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,040
at X 0 D and it should return

312
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,900
information and in this case it'll

313
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,960
always just return 0 X 2 a that's just

314
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,940
what this particular device says so I'm

315
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:46,809
going to ask it to tell me

316
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:49,069
I'm going to ask it to tell me what is

317
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:51,499
at that zero X zero D and we expect the

318
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:57,769
answer to be zero X to a so it's

319
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:00,319
connected it's running it's looking for

320
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,939
a trigger and it's sampling cool so

321
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:06,199
let's go find it

322
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:10,609
ah here we are some things happened this

323
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:15,379
one says zero X to a cool and it says to

324
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,269
weigh over here as well because I told

325
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:20,509
it to excellent so we know that our

326
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:26,600
seller ometer hooked up correctly let's

327
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,199
get this back so we know our

328
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,819
accelerometer is hooked up correctly and

329
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:33,139
we're able to talk to it so that was the

330
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:34,999
first time that the tehsil here has

331
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:38,419
talked to this little Mme 84 device on

332
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:40,519
here and this talked back to it so

333
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,299
communications working so back to the

334
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:47,089
problem we know that we only need the

335
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,609
z-axis and this is this little image of

336
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,049
on the side here is from the datasheet

337
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:52,639
and it says that if it's upside down

338
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,129
you'll get a negative Z and if it's

339
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:58,549
right side up you'll get a positive Z so

340
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:00,319
how do we learn whether the Z is

341
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,059
negative or positive well we're gonna

342
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,499
look these are copied and pasted from

343
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:06,919
the datasheet so this is the out z

344
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,720
there's two of them that say out see and

345
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,629
there's MSB and LSB and that stands for

346
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:13,250
most significant and lis significant

347
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,980
bits maybe those of you with classical

348
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,329
computer science education already know

349
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,829
these things but most significant bits

350
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,110
are gonna be the like if you had a

351
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,779
hundred or if you had 123 the most

352
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,429
significant part of that would be the

353
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:34,129
100 and the least significant would be

354
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:38,960
the 3 right so since we only care about

355
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,879
the negative versus positive we'll

356
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:42,379
expect this to be in the most

357
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:45,019
significant digit and specifically

358
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:46,159
there's this thing called two's

359
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,629
complement which according to the

360
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:50,779
datasheet is what this device with this

361
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,940
Mme 84 accelerometer device uses and

362
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,169
two's complement which I'm going to

363
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:00,340
grossly simplify right here

364
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,549
is a way to say negative versus positive

365
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,770
by using the most significant bit as a

366
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,330
placeholder for a negative or positive

367
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,370
service a negative or positive sign

368
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,549
right so if it's a 1 there is a minus

369
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,529
sign present and if it's a 0 there's no

370
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,140
minus sign present there's more to two's

371
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,580
complement but that's the important bit

372
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,900
for this demo so in this case the most

373
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,950
significant bit is bit 7 and if bit 7

374
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,730
gives us back a 0 then it is positive

375
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,159
and if it's 7 is 1 then we have a

376
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,730
negative number ok so let's start with

377
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:43,570
we need to read out Z MSB so if we look

378
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,570
back at the registers here this one it

379
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,880
says out z the most significant bits are

380
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,870
located at 0 X 0 5 so so far so good

381
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,970
we'll go we've got the same stuff up

382
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,590
here now we're looking at different

383
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,600
register to read we only need the one

384
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,480
register and within an interval of one

385
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,429
second we're going to ask it for that

386
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:10,419
register ok and usually I'd like to do a

387
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:13,149
demo here that shows you the importance

388
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:17,590
of reading the datasheet if I ran this

389
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,380
as it is I would get this repeating

390
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,510
value over here of 94 no matter how I

391
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,830
move this around whether it flip it

392
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,510
upside down or not

393
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,399
and that is because I didn't read the

394
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,279
part where it says oh the system is in a

395
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,960
low power mode when you turn it on so

396
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,279
you actually have to tell it to start

397
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,630
reading data for it to start reading

398
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,090
data read the datasheet that's the moral

399
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,510
we'll skip to it and all you have to do

400
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,220
there is you get this diagram that says

401
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,080
go to the control register and set the

402
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,429
active bit to one of course and so you

403
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:50,710
go google around in the or a search

404
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,970
around in the datasheet and you find

405
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,380
this thing called the control register

406
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,940
and set the active bit to one so let's

407
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,640
go ahead and do that so we've got the

408
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,350
same stuff we had before right that

409
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,419
active interval address route to read

410
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,520
but before that we're gonna do this set

411
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,399
active where we send the buffer that

412
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:14,150
says of these 8 bits set the last one

413
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,740
to be one great zealot good you look

414
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:31,020
good great

415
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,070
so what we're expecting right now and

416
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,270
I'll take these off we don't need them

417
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,750
anymore

418
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,970
what we're expecting right now is that

419
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,780
if I take this device and I have it one

420
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,960
way and then I move it another way we're

421
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,670
gonna get different data coming out oh

422
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,210
and if we go back to the console here

423
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,310
you can see that in fact data looks

424
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,170
different if I've got upside or if I've

425
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,430
got it right side up it looks pretty

426
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,170
similar over here I flip it over

427
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,450
something different is happening so

428
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,010
that's good what is that what is that

429
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,010
number so the system's awake we're

430
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:13,070
getting data what we haven't done is

431
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,390
interpreted the 8 bits that we get back

432
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,740
for just this first bit what we're

433
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,630
seeing right now is the number created

434
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,940
if you interpret the for the top eight

435
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,110
most significant bits as a number which

436
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,080
turns into a hex value which is the same

437
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,900
as it yeah don't worry about it what we

438
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,580
need to do is isolate whether or not

439
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,410
this first bit is a 0 or a 1 and we're

440
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,480
gonna do some sort of weird trick here

441
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,840
where we need to find out if the number

442
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,660
that we get back is bigger than 0 1 1 1

443
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,550
1 1 11 because anything bigger than that

444
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,830
is gonna have to have a 1 in the most

445
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,760
significant digit you asked me about

446
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,530
this later if it's confusing to you this

447
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:05,030
was like a weird mental trick for me but

448
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,520
basically that's isolating whether this

449
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,010
is a 0 or a 1 and so we'll be able to

450
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,230
print out if it is a 1 here then we know

451
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,880
it's negative and if it's a 0 here we

452
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:30,630
know it's positive so t2 run oh 7

453
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,430
I'd like to encourage you again if I I

454
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,260
think I might actually have time to take

455
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,110
questions at the end here which is great

456
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,790
so please if I have confused you here

457
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,290
please raise your hand and let me know

458
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,110
so we're getting a result and this says

459
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:57,230
positive right-side up and yeah cool so

460
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,160
it works and I'm hoping that last bit

461
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:08,770
wasn't terribly mystifying but we've got

462
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,720
basically the problem solved here if we

463
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,160
want to tell whether it's right side up

464
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,430
or upside down without using a built in

465
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,850
API so that's just the very start of it

466
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,760
right so what I've done with this this

467
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,680
is the Excel Mme 84 module on node it's

468
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,450
got more functions than this you can

469
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,970
tell it how fast you want to do it you

470
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,380
can take all these different register

471
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,030
descriptions and break them out into the

472
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,830
JavaScript software they're all like

473
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,230
part of the node API there's just

474
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,880
endless stuff that you can do once

475
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,620
you've gotten your basic information out

476
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,030
of it but that's all I'm gonna do up

477
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,700
here on stage and I hope if you want to

478
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,610
come to the workshop tomorrow I hope you

479
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,780
can come up with some interesting

480
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,090
interpretations we've got sensors that

481
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,500
aren't on pretty breakout boards like

482
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,860
this so you can learn how to do alcohol

483
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,260
sensing and load force and all those

484
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,030
type of stuff that we actually don't

485
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,800
have any node modules for us you'll be

486
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,730
inventing it that's all my demo if you'd

487
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,230
like to look at these slides I actually

488
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,740
have a few other demos that I didn't

489
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,310
show today I showed these ones and if

490
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,230
you want to look at a slower step

491
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,700
through these other ones are available

492
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,100
to you and you can find my slides if you

493
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,450
go to github free whole Singapore demos

494
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,490
oh and I have a book that's recently out

495
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,200
if you'd like to get into it it's not

496
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,639
just tehsil it's all sorts

497
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:41,029
different boards does anybody have

498
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:45,619
questions there's no way I explained it

499
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:50,059
that well yeah

500
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:58,879
oh do we have a microphone over here so

501
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:01,219
maybe for the last part when you're

502
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:03,799
compared is off-site that is up or done

503
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:08,269
you can just shift the bits seven-digit

504
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:09,950
just check the most significant

505
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,249
significant bit it's a mental area is

506
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:15,619
easier to understand that than comparing

507
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,989
with where the binary number

508
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:20,539
you understand why me yeah you're right

509
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:22,099
so it depends on what kind of mental

510
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:25,039
aerobics are easier for you he was

511
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,649
suggesting that instead of comparing

512
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:30,709
this 0 1 1 1 1 1 number I could just

513
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,539
shift the bits down in order to just get

514
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:34,369
rid of these extra numbers that I don't

515
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:38,389
care about yeah for me this was easier

516
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,729
for you it might be it might be easier

517
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:43,190
to do it a different way and that's kind

518
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,969
of what's fun is if you start with

519
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:48,859
looking up sensors online you have just

520
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:51,440
a ton of freedom to to mess around and

521
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,179
decide what implementation you would

522
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:57,829
like a little bit more time if you have

523
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:04,969
another pressing question you left

524
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:07,489
everybody speechless well alright then

525
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:09,409
I'll expect all of you to make me a

526
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:10,579
firmware thing tomorrow

527
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,859
go and meet Kelsey afterwards right and

528
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:14,479
maybe take a look at the hard way

529
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:19,190
yourself - all right give a round of

530
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,750
applause to Cassie
