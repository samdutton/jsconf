00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,340

ok so today I want to talk to you

2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,540
to help you organize and develop web

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,050
applications so that they're ready for

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,290
users that speak different languages and

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,480
I realized that this might not be a

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,430
problem that you have you may be working

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,020
on something like you know a local

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,960
newspaper that only publishes news for

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,760
Windows iris so you may need to

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,470
translate Clarion gum but you know if

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,600
your yahoo and you have 800 million

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,489
users spread out throughout the globe

13
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:46,050
then this is definitely a necessity and

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,150
you know this is a really old problem by

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,750
now and for which there are a lot of

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,970
really good solutions in the server side

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,519
and foreign languages at this Java or

18
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:01,000
PHP but we found that in JavaScript

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,430
there are some features that we're

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,019
lacking and that's why we're started

21
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,229
working on this and so let's to put

22
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,530
things in context what we're trying to

23
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,750
work on is a internationalized web

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,490
applications but in the context of a

25
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,729
modern web application that it's you

26
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:20,439
know a single page application that uses

27
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,719
JavaScript or running in the browser so

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,430
that you don't have to duel or reloads

29
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,810
and make the sprint faster but an issue

30
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,789
that we have with this approach at Yahoo

31
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,530
is that we have a lot of content such as

32
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,130
news or weather information or photos

33
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,189
and flickr that's relatively static

34
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,680
content that we don't want to wait one

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,810
or two seconds to load javascript in

36
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,329
order to show that kundan so to us

37
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:49,060
several surrender is crucial we want to

38
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,469
show the content as pass a fast as

39
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:54,520
possible and you know the current in

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,950
fact a to that we have for insole that

41
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,170
is for instance we had some supporting

42
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,280
YY and there's some really good projects

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,679
lecture queries globalization is that we

44
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:07,570
can get this to work on the on the

45
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,110
server side so um the give me giving an

46
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,750
example bit more concrete example so

47
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,260
this is a screenshot of the flickr photo

48
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,880
page you know the photo would be

49
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,460
actually above the screen and as you can

50
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,410
see I've marked with some arrows some

51
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,200
key parts of it this is mostly the maid

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,640
evade around the image like the

53
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,180
scripture

54
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,989
which company was taken for with and the

55
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,719
parts that i highlighted are actual

56
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,510
dynamic data that you normally stir in a

57
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,579
database like you know how many views

58
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:42,099
the father who had how many favorites or

59
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:45,969
likes when was it photo taken and you

60
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,379
know this is data that trucks really

61
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:50,859
normally turn the database as raw data

62
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:54,010
such as you know an integer or a data

63
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,040
object so this is data that you actually

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,859
have to format somehow to display to the

65
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,139
user because you're not going to say oh

66
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:05,650
yeah this photo was taken two million

67
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,620
seconds before nineteen seventy so let's

68
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,969
start from the beginning with the

69
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:15,810
simplest sampling room we can think of

70
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,419
so this number to see in the screen for

71
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,489
ninety five percent of you in the

72
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:23,560
audience will be the number a thousand

73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,409
and two but for most of the figures

74
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,480
today who are from the USA this is

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,280
actually number one with two thousands

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,560
we all know this is because in Spanish

77
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,829
we use a dot send the limiter for the

78
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,989
Sultan's but in English you use a coma

79
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:43,599
as a sultan millimeter but this you know

80
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,760
that in French they actually use spaces

81
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,549
I just learned about it because my boss

82
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,590
is French and you know don't get me

83
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,470
started out dates I've been working as a

84
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,079
remote employee for over two years and

85
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,269
the number of times that it mixed up the

86
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,540
day and the month I just lost count so

87
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,409
Minister Lee ambiguous is this the 11 of

88
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:11,769
december or is this november 12 I don't

89
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,739
know so it's awesome that we a quick

90
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,590
actually can gather all these little

91
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,840
differences the way in the way with show

92
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,570
and displaying numbers and dates in

93
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,340
different languages and we can put them

94
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,409
in a big table and that thing actually

95
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:30,250
exists and it's called the CLD are the

96
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,680
Unicode common local data repository

97
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,690
this might say Madison group that

98
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,120
actually defines the standard for the

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,569
utf-8 encoding and

100
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:42,039
what these things allows you to do is

101
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,349
say okay how do I show a number or a

102
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:50,289
date in Arabic or Chinese and again it

103
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,509
turns out that a certain group inside

104
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:55,539
tc39 which is the committee that defines

105
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:58,419
the JavaScript language realize this and

106
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,469
worked on a standard called acma 402

107
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,459
which is the standard

108
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:06,819
internationalisation api for javascript

109
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:09,240
and it actually recommends that the

110
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,930
implementations use the CLD our data so

111
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,069
how does this API look like we have a

112
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:20,490
int'l global object with free properties

113
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,379
number formats and data format kind of

114
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,209
describe themselves and int'l dhadka

115
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,180
later is actually an utility for

116
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,119
comparing strings so you can for

117
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:35,259
instance sort the fine names in Chinese

118
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:38,830
because it understands how the old utf-8

119
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,649
encoding works and how you sort things

120
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:44,830
in Chinese but we're actually not using

121
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,899
it at the moment because an

122
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,729
implementation in pure JavaScript would

123
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:51,849
be too big you know the algorithm is

124
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,229
really large and it requires a lot of

125
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,800
data so we realize we can't just use in

126
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,289
the browser so for now not gonna talk

127
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,639
about it so how do you actually use this

128
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,069
well it's really simple you create an

129
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,490
instance of int'l number format this

130
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,339
instance has format method which taken

131
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,229
um takes a number and gives you a string

132
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:16,539
with you know the number formatted

133
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:19,449
correctly if you don't specify anything

134
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:23,019
it will use the locale that the user

135
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:26,139
chose for the system or the browser but

136
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:28,509
you can even specify it if you want so

137
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,579
instance if your application has you

138
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,740
know an option to change the language of

139
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,879
the application say goes for daytime

140
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,249
formatting you create an instance of

141
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:42,009
int'l daytime formats it also has a

142
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,930
floor admitted with six the date

143
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,569
instance and it gives you back a string

144
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:49,029
we know the month in the day in the

145
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,690
right order and

146
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,530
so again you can specify more options if

147
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,560
you want and it'll give you a date

148
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,480
format it in a way that's more readable

149
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,970
by human you can even include the day of

150
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,770
the week or a long version of the month

151
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,520
so now that we have this int'l OPI that

152
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,560
we know will probably work in both

153
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,330
circular browser we start asking

154
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,800
ourselves okay so in the context of

155
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,800
single page application where do we use

156
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,860
it how would have to be use it and so

157
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,110
give enough you know standard MVC

158
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,600
architecture we start asking ourselves

159
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,300
should we use this API in the module

160
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,270
well if we feed in the model then we are

161
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,820
kind of mixing up this logic between

162
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,250
localization with you know the code that

163
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,620
actually does netball fetching or

164
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,040
database access or input validation so I

165
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,640
cannot didn't quite fit there and so

166
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,350
what about the controller where the

167
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,240
controller actually has your business

168
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,010
logic you know the stuff that actually

169
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,960
makes your application what you're what

170
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,420
it is so why would you put translation

171
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,210
go there and when they are realizing

172
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,050
that you know there's a parallel to CSS

173
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,770
here on HTML in that we're we have raw

174
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,480
data that we're trying to present

175
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,590
somehow in a specific way to the user

176
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,090
the same way that you use media queries

177
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,300
to show different styles according to

178
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,150
the size of the device and with that in

179
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,120
mind with you know this idea of doing

180
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,460
things in the view and having servers a

181
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,410
train whistle use project we're calling

182
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,760
for Matias it's basically a set of

183
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,010
integrations with high-level view

184
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,560
libraries and you know you can go to

185
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,630
format is that I oh and there's a lot of

186
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,750
documentation and information there

187
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,060
about both the project and the int'l OPI

188
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,750
and so as I said we have basically

189
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,800
integrations with popular view engines

190
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,750
such as template engines like handle

191
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,040
version dust or react as Sebastian was

192
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,300
mentioning a few moments ago

193
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,610
so I want to show you some examples of

194
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,650
have these words and having you can use

195
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,920
it and I'm going to get them in

196
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,480
handlebars because I think it's probably

197
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,180
gonna be more familiar to all of you

198
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,120
here so in Cumnor words we have this

199
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,000
formats number helper which takes a

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,190
number and an optional second argument

201
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,560
that allows you to say oh this number is

202
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,240
actually percentage or a specific

203
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,260
currency and again same goes for date

204
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,620
formatting we have a format date helper

205
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,750
which takes a date and a couple of

206
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,030
functions to specify how you're going to

207
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:45,250
show this show this date and so far if

208
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,500
you spend a little time to think about

209
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,960
it you can realize okay we actually you

210
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,600
know formatting this data in a way this

211
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,520
useful for the user but it doesn't

212
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,470
really have to do with specific

213
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,050
different languages you can use it just

214
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,480
for displaying these numbers and dates

215
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,450
in a way it's readable even if your your

216
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,590
website is just in one language so now

217
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,210
that we have Dave we start asking our

218
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,060
game so what what's next what more can

219
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,170
we worked on to just end this API and as

220
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,930
I said at the beginning of the talk this

221
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,210
is a problem spaces has been explored a

222
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,150
lot in server-side languages and one

223
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,980
very successful project was started by

224
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,340
IBM quite a few years ago and it's the

225
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,010
ICU library international components for

226
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,060
unicode and this library has been

227
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,770
available for C++ and Java for a long

228
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,890
time and it's pretty much an industry

229
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,810
standard right now and it's in fact the

230
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,180
same library that some browsers used to

231
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,350
implement the in July bi and the thing

232
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,820
that we liked about the AC library is

233
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,070
that it has this feature called message

234
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,520
formatting and mr. formatting allows you

235
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,400
to write these sort of complex sentences

236
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,160
that depend on during your dynamic data

237
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,720
and this is the kind of thing that are

238
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,390
actually kind of hard to do without some

239
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,280
help from software you know you know you

240
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,070
have to start concatenating strings and

241
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,800
in some awkward things with your code

242
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,050
mix this up you're actually translations

243
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,990
with your data so for example in this

244
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,350
case we have a portion of the sentence

245
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,230
that depends on the value of a certain

246
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,839
value such as mum likes in this case and

247
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,390
the rest is just syntax for special

248
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,089
tokens that refer to values in your code

249
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:43,570
again so if a message is already knew

250
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,149
about numbers and days so you only also

251
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:49,000
have smaller preserves tokens that help

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,589
you with numbers and dates and finally

253
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,230
we have ok so this is an example her

254
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,360
losing hundred words again we have four

255
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,240
not message really simple helper that

256
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,890
takes what there is an reference to the

257
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,800
actual message in your context in new

258
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,750
condo where context and the rest is just

259
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,750
a mapping between the values for the

260
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,730
tokens and the values in your handlebar

261
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,200
context and finally we had this feature

262
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,880
request for a long time to work

263
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,570
something called relative time format in

264
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,899
that is you know until T for giving a

265
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:31,000
date in the past calculate the

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,770
difference between that date in the past

267
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,200
and now and give you the difference in a

268
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,930
way that's human readable so if you have

269
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,880
all 8 24 hours ago and you specify just

270
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,370
use format relative it will try to give

271
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,750
you the best fit possible and then say

272
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,500
yesterday which makes sense or if you

273
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,600
can actually force it to use numeric

274
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,579
hours and but anyone just give you know

275
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:57,130
just the number 24 it'll just give you

276
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,810
it will give you and part of the

277
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,180
sentence that says as having de cuatro

278
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:07,180
de Soto 24 hours ago so to wrap this up

279
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,949
I kind of want to take a little step

280
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:12,579
back and try and answer a question that

281
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,170
has been asked to me a lot lately

282
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,040
because around a couple of months ago we

283
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,500
announced that we are not working on Yui

284
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,230
anymore and so one of the reasons that

285
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,230
we're not working on it is because of

286
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,370
how the JavaScript

287
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,400
system looks like nowadays we've seen in

288
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,410
the last couple of years recently an

289
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,190
explosion of JS frameworks and libraries

290
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,890
there's really hard to keep up with and

291
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,089
you know some of them are really good

292
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,839
and we wanted to use them and so I think

293
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,870
that the reason why we see in this many

294
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,850
libraries and frameworks come up so if

295
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,220
I'm even when there are you know really

296
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,460
popular ones that is why our jquery UI

297
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,180
or backbone we still see new MVC

298
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,050
frameworks every day i think we can use

299
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,290
a med over here and and i think the same

300
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,990
applies for programming languages so

301
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,880
recently I was listening to this lecture

302
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,600
by Alex I can a professor at Stanford

303
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,779
who specializes in compilers and he was

304
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:24,650
explaining how why he thinks that even

305
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,450
though we have really popular languages

306
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,010
such as Java or C++ or Java Script we

307
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,140
still see new languages coming up every

308
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,500
day in chaska we see lots and lots of

309
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,540
languages that actually compile to

310
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,730
JavaScript and the reason he says is

311
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,730
that because it's easier to not that

312
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,459
it's easier is less costly to write any

313
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,589
language then go and modify one and

314
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,650
fixed one and that's because you know to

315
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,240
come up with a new language you just

316
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,730
need to three smart people you put in a

317
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,830
room and you get in your language or you

318
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,990
big Brendan Eich 10 days and you get any

319
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,970
language and best friend on over there

320
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,290
and but if we need to actually change

321
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,170
the language you have to give you know

322
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,500
we have around 10 million JavaScript

323
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,660
developers so if you have to change the

324
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,360
language and change all the applications

325
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,430
that those 10 million developer roads

326
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,870
there's a lot of cost in human hours and

327
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,520
I think the same thing I'm applies to

328
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,339
frame words you have a standard base but

329
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:31,610
eventually people recite to break and

330
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,060
write a new one instead of changing all

331
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,900
the code that I already have so in order

332
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,570
to you know again in Yui we had this

333
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,550
base layer that deal with done

334
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,589
and and you know give some cohesion to

335
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:53,899
the library it eventually you know

336
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:56,880
eventually worked as a wall that

337
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,060
separated us between YY and the rest of

338
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,269
the JavaScript ecosystem and so each

339
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,100
time that we wanted to use I don't know

340
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,860
something like moment jas or a new

341
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,870
library that we like we had to kind of

342
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,680
adapt it to the y y way and so the

343
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,209
problem the point that I'm trying to

344
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,029
make is that this this will keep

345
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:20,339
happening we will keep seeing languages

346
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,680
we will keep seeing new frameworks come

347
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,839
up every day and so the way we build our

348
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,720
souls and we build our libraries has to

349
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,339
keep that in mind we need to keep in

350
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,519
mind that the the ecosystem will keep

351
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,329
evolving and sub for Matias was one way

352
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,140
we try to avoid this issue and the day

353
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,480
we did it is by doing something that

354
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,529
Sebastian talked a lot about today and

355
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,000
will be Lynn on top of poly fields will

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,130
building on top of JavaScript

357
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,770
implementations of the existing api's in

358
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,440
case of from ajs we use an insole which

359
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,620
is rather stable but we may look into

360
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,310
others and on top of it we just use you

361
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,309
know this really small abstraction layer

362
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:07,650
that we try and do the effort to keep us

363
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,419
as small as possible and then we just

364
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,870
add whatever you think is missing you

365
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,970
know the way we add those things that

366
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,699
aren't there in the in the web platform

367
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:21,030
yet I cannot rise to address the issues

368
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,429
that Sebastian came up with so for

369
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:26,220
instance instead of going and modifying

370
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,809
the interglobal object to other our own

371
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,110
stuff we keep our own Global's such as

372
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,510
instead of you know until dot relative

373
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,280
time which could be standardized some

374
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,200
day we're just doing into relative time

375
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,550
as a 1 by a 1 and in some of that we are

376
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,860
you know we come up with a symbol simple

377
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,890
way to integrate weather frameworks so

378
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,230
what we do can you know adapt easily to

379
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,540
a to any new frame the red comes up but

380
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,300
actually our

381
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,250
I honestly our final goal is to come up

382
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,690
with oh let's see if I can trigger this

383
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,160
sorry so the goal is to come up with

384
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,960
something that looks like this we want

385
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,790
to take these new ideas that we have

386
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,500
such as messy formatting which is

387
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,520
actually already a proposal for the

388
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,250
standardization and relative time which

389
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,050
is in isn't already there I wanted to

390
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,030
contribute back to the web standards we

391
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,790
want to work with tc39 and the other

392
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,130
standard communities to bring this ideas

393
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,900
back into the language so the last

394
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,490
longer and everyone can use it not just

395
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,140
ours so the tip thinking if if you're

396
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,540
interested in four matches go

397
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,540
deformities that I oh and I think I hope

398
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,280
that at least if you're even if you're

399
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,230
not using the stools you take some time

400
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,640
before you start working on your

401
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,060
application or writing a new framework

402
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,250
or library to think about how it

403
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,780
integrates with the web platform and

404
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,280
what's already in the platform that you

405
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:06,930
can use
