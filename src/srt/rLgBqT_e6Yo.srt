[Music]

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,719
hey everyone so I'm back again for a

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,910
quick lightening talk after I saw Tim's

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,609
talk on CSS I couldn't resist

5
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,980
and I wanted to add in a JavaScript

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,960
pranks demo for you guys so if you can

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,970
prank and CSS when I prank and

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,679
JavaScript as well so there's this

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,960
website here I made I'm gonna go over

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,059
some of the code with you guys really

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,550
quickly we can see how to troll in

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,260
JavaScript okay so this is very ad hoc

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,410
so apologies for the informality of this

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,230
okay so one thing you can do is some

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,879
websites on the internet they actually

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,129
lets you log out the site with a get

17
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,680
request so if you visit this you are

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,390
these URLs here you'll be logged out of

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,370
those sites well guess what any website

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,440
on the Internet can make get requests by

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,480
putting those URLs into an image tag and

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,880
that will log you out so let's go ahead

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,200
and iterate over this and just log you

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,310
out of everything when you visit this

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,250
site why not right

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:17,520
let's see what else let's see okay

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
here's a good one so no sorry it's down

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,799
here yes okay this is this one is

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,930
amazing so when you link to a website

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,100
and you add the target equals a blank

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,140
underscore blank to the link that opens

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,110
the link up in a new tab but it also

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,680
sets a property called window opener on

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,229
that child window and that property is a

35
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,420
reference back to the parent window that

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,970
opened you and using that reference you

37
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,280
can set window opener dot location and

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,649
to navigate to the window that linked to

39
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,049
you so for example you send a link to

40
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,490
this site to your friends and met in

41
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,310
facebook Messenger and the site you land

42
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,350
on navigates the facebook messenger

43
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,479
window to the same troll site so it

44
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,810
takes over the other tab pretty cool

45
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,680
this is a standard troll trick so this

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,720
one lets you confirm that the user

47
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,400
really wants to leave the website that

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,050
there

49
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,130
they're on so and they try to close the

50
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,960
tab they have to see another prompt

51
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,920
window here's another good one let's

52
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,750
register every protocol handler that we

53
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,480
can in the browser so when you click on

54
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,970
these links it will try to redirect you

55
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,860
to this site this one has a permission

56
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,020
prompt so it's not that effective but

57
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,360
you can try to do it anyway while we're

58
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,680
at it let's try to get access to the

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,570
camera and the mic basically we're just

60
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,070
putting everything we can into this site

61
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,840
just all the API is let's just try to

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,010
just do everything we can

63
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,190
oh this is a good one did you know if

64
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,810
you call web window dot navigator dot

65
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,670
vibrate you can make Android phones

66
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,200
vibrate and there's no permission

67
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,270
required for that so let's just vibrate

68
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,930
the phone randomly why not let's

69
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,840
intercept every click and keypress let's

70
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,030
use a Safari picture-in-picture video

71
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,700
when you click on the page let's focus

72
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,530
it's open a bunch of pop-up windows and

73
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,630
bounce them around the screen let's

74
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,040
focus those windows every time you

75
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,380
interact with any of the windows let's

76
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,910
hide the mouse cursor with C it with a

77
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,560
CSS rule so you don't know where the

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,030
mouse is so it's hard to go and close

79
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,220
the windows let's trigger a file

80
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,510
download every time you click on

81
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,170
anything why not this is the code to

82
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,209
move the window around this is a code to

83
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,950
play videos inside the pop-up windows

84
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,760
how much time do I have

85
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,340
you've got a clock in front of you 1:45

86
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,870
ok ok I'm gonna see the last minute to

87
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,480
demo it ok every time you click we can

88
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,340
copy stuff to your clipboard so let's

89
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,320
copy a ASCII picture of a cat and that's

90
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,480
right here one of these cats copy it to

91
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,980
your clipboard along with the link handy

92
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,050
link to this website so when you paste

93
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,940
it in by accident to your friends you'll

94
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,690
get it will get spread further and what

95
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,959
else do I got to show there's a few more

96
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,300
things Oh show with some alerts let's

97
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,610
request full screen so on and so forth

98
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,870
anyway you get the idea let's see it in

99
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,590
action ok this is Safari we're gonna go

100
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,040
to the annoying site calm okay Oh some

101
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,870
files are being downloaded do I'm sure I

102
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,430
want to give camera access to the site

103
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,890
ok don't allow ok all right we're good

104
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,890
I'm gonna try to click on this cat oh no

105
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,610
oh no what's going on here

106
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,620
okay let me just leave the page

107
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,110
okay now I'm in full screen mode I don't

108
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,760
know what's going on let me close this

109
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,270
window

110
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,090
leave page I have some pop-ups flying

111
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,630
around let me try to close these if you

112
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,040
accidentally click on the window then it

113
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,310
alerts that a cat comes up and then it

114
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,510
also does a picture-in-picture full

115
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,690
screen video over here in the OS if you

116
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,540
try to close that then okay it goes back

117
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,890
if you try to get command W to close the

118
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,540
window it triggers a print dialog window

119
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,940
so actually it intercepts the command W

120
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,490
can't close the window the X button is

121
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,890
also removed here okay let's try again

122
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,030
command W oh no basically the moral this

123
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,710
story is the web platform is very

124
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,050
powerful and it lets you do very many

125
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,620
things and oh yeah this is a good one

126
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,480
this one does Bing searches for very

127
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,090
intimidating terms and it doesn't over

128
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,310
HTTP a gets its HTTP but it tries to do

129
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,380
it over HTTP so that it'll get added to

130
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,540
your oh yeah it also gets added to your

131
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,180
web history so you go history and all

132
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,500
those searches like why do I always have

133
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,060
diarrhea for example is added to your

134
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,990
web history anyway that's my top thanks
