00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,300

[Applause]

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,680
hi everyone thank you for coming to my

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,300
talk oh my gosh this is so many people

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,710
yeah so I'm just gonna start with a

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,070
disclaimer that this is a tech talk

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,680
about my necklace so I'm just gonna talk

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,740
for 30 minutes about my necklace and I

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,380
can do that because there is a ton of

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,769
tech involved in this necklace and it's

10
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,640
responding to people around me so yeah

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,180
you can see I have a lot of electronics

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,350
currently strapped to my body so I have

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,989
this choker with a camera attached in

14
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,239
the cameras attached to a Raspberry Pi 3

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,510
B plus and the Raspberry Pi is running

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,110
nodejs

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,360
and it's running tensorflow j/s and it's

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,340
with tensorflow JSS running an image

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,710
recognition model the machine learning

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,059
model and the PI determines how many

21
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,219
people it sees and it sends that

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,770
information to an Adreno and the Arduino

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,690
is controlling the lights on this

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,689
necklace and it updates these colors and

25
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,610
patterns of LEDs based on parameters

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,780
I've set for how it should respond like

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,020
Paul said I am a not a hardware hacker

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,270
for work I am a web developer so I

29
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,720
mainly do react HTML CSS and

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,420
accessibility I work on Microsoft to do

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,119
which if you want to organize your day

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,860
it's a great app or if you want to use

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,290
it like me and make lists of weird

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,600
German words and a few names for future

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,840
pets you can use that too and I go by

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,820
she/her pronouns okay um yeah I'm really

37
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,829
fascinated with making myself income

38
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,560
uncomfortable in public so a few years

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,049
ago I started making lighted clothing

40
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,220
because I just thought they were really

41
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,799
beautiful but that's also a burden for

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,350
me because I love them but it's kind of

43
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,969
hard to deal with sometimes all the

44
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,640
attention that they draw but I've tried

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,180
to learn how to channel that and from

46
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,729
anxiety into more like fascination and

47
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,220
excitement and also try to use them to

48
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,150
come confront my discomfort

49
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,599
of drawing attention to myself and I

50
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,769
just want to start off by showing you

51
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:25,339
some of the projects I started with so

52
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,939
so the first project I ever made was

53
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,780
this fiber optic dress and made this a

54
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,220
few years ago because I was going to a

55
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,750
festival and I thought this is what you

56
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,769
were supposed to do and I basically add

57
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,459
this link is linked to the kit I bought

58
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:46,150
it's actually a fiber optic rave whip so

59
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,980
it's like a flashlight with like 200

60
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,019
strands of fiber optics attached and I

61
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:51,879
guess you sling it around or something I

62
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,849
don't know but I coffee Dan

63
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,980
Instructables tutorial I bought this kid

64
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,720
it has just like this flashlight with

65
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,000
preset programs so I didn't code any I

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,280
didn't saw it or any and my mom kindly

67
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,920
made this dress for me and I sewed these

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,139
two hundred strands to the dress and

69
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:10,150
made this really cool-looking jellyfish

70
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,730
dress and it people really loved it I

71
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,919
got a lot of compliments I felt

72
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,739
extremely awkward I wasn't it was first

73
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,389
time wearing anything lit and I wasn't

74
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,430
used to all the attention but it was a

75
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,379
positive attention so gave me a

76
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:28,659
self-esteem boost which was like the

77
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:32,440
trade-off I wish it could have been more

78
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,510
alive though because I set a program and

79
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,159
I was that was it there was no like

80
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,449
interactivity aspect to it so last year

81
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:43,449
I made this project which I called with

82
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,340
Paul helps me name this project it's

83
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,430
called Hall it's Couture and so it's

84
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,260
just multiple coordinated pieces and I

85
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,690
gave that link is I gave several

86
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,359
versions of a talk about this so that's

87
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,940
a link to my talk at Jas coffee you last

88
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,810
year so I have these multiple pieces

89
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,829
they're all coordinated together there's

90
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,709
a an app using react that you could

91
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,840
control the lights with anyone on the

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,310
web could change the colors and the

93
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,530
patterns it was a lot of coding I had a

94
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,539
web app built in react and then I had a

95
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,479
node.js server it was using MQTT

96
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:22,419
messaging protocol to relay information

97
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:23,450
and

98
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,060
had each piece had an Adreno in it and

99
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,850
it was a ton of bartering i soldered

100
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,640
each of these pieces sometimes I had to

101
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,830
rebuild and had to do it multiple times

102
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,260
because that's with hardware yeah so

103
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,930
with this project I purposely wanted to

104
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,640
explore creating this temporary

105
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,980
experience that connected a viewer

106
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,070
directly to an the artwork for a brief

107
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,080
period so to kind of blur the lines

108
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,610
between who's the artist

109
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,780
and who's the viewer and I wanted to

110
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,760
explore the reactions of people when

111
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,930
they realized that the lies could be

112
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,090
changed with a web app that they had

113
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,600
complete control over my outfit um and

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,120
it was an interesting experiment but

115
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,250
what I realized that I was doing it more

116
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,070
to please other people

117
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,900
which is ok but it was less of the

118
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,760
direction that I wanted to go in I

119
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,220
wanted to be more focused on me and what

120
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,590
I was experiencing um the last project I

121
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,370
built last year was this speech to image

122
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,660
necklace I know there's no sound but I

123
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,610
have basically the caption I'm saying I

124
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,510
like turtles

125
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,040
and then it's showing the meme if you

126
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,990
know of like the kid dressed as a zombie

127
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,180
and he says and I like turtles

128
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,490
so so this is the last project I made so

129
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,410
it was just it's meant to show

130
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,220
accompanying images as I talk in hopes

131
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,960
that people would find me interesting

132
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,820
and stay engaged speaking to me so it

133
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,070
has a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen I

134
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,510
just plugged in it so the Raspberry Pi

135
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,830
is just behind the touch screen there

136
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,210
and on that PI I have a no js' server

137
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,280
that sins and it has a microphone in a

138
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,530
sends audio to the Google speech

139
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,310
recognition API and then it sends those

140
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,430
key words to the Google Search API which

141
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,220
I have a custom image search criteria

142
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,800
set up so then it would show an image

143
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,990
correlate to what I'm saying so I liked

144
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,310
that it was responsive to the

145
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,800
environment but because I was using

146
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,270
these api's I still needed Wi-Fi so that

147
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,620
I kind of wanted to get rid of like the

148
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,670
Wi-Fi dependency on future projects and

149
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,570
a side note I didn't realize I was

150
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,250
really working with machine learning on

151
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,290
this and this is relevant cuz I'm gonna

152
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,700
talk a lot about machine learning so I

153
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,680
just wanted to point out that ironically

154
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,940
I didn't realize always working with

155
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,710
machine learning I just thought you know

156
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,360
until it really looks back at my project

157
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,500
I know that's a bit naive

158
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,720
but I also feel like machine learning is

159
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,370
so pervasive you just sometimes feel

160
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,740
like you're using api's but you're

161
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,140
actually using machine learning because

162
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,700
I just thought I was sending data and

163
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:11,090
get a response so my current project so

164
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,950
I wanted to take the things I liked

165
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,050
about other projects and go in this

166
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,110
different direction I wanted to be

167
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,550
responsive to people around me but it

168
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,120
will it increases my discomfort unless I

169
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,820
can conform to social norms so what that

170
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,880
means is very innocent flashy and

171
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,350
attention-getting when I'm alone when

172
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,050
I'm off by myself and it only calms down

173
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,150
and eventually turns off when I'm

174
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,770
sociable and surround myself with other

175
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,170
people so it's less about

176
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,110
purposely attracting people it's more

177
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,000
about me wanting to get rid of the lies

178
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,710
as fast as possible

179
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,770
and I think I might have convinced you

180
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,960
that with this progression of work that

181
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,210
my progression of work through my

182
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,340
projects it was a convincing reason for

183
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,280
me to build this Nexus but I've misled

184
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,550
you a bit there was actually like a

185
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,860
really pivotal moment that I decided to

186
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,230
build this so like I said I work at

187
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,540
Microsoft to do in Berlin and I started

188
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,870
this job almost a year ago and I was at

189
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,280
this really first time working at a

190
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,060
really big tech company and I was very

191
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,450
insecure because I'm not I don't come

192
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,220
from a computer science background and

193
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,650
everyone else had like masters and been

194
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,150
doing computer science since they were

195
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,880
like 12 years old and folks started a

196
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,320
machine learning study group so we were

197
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,979
doing a big online MOOC course and I was

198
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,290
falling behind from the first study

199
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,570
group session and I felt really insecure

200
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,900
about that but I wanted to prove mainly

201
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,930
to myself that I could learn all these

202
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,680
concepts

203
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,050
do it in my own style and for me that

204
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,490
meant I really need to build something

205
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,439
physical like I have a physical use case

206
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:56,629
that was relevant to me and my interest

207
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:59,959
and this is so the real reason I built

208
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,220
this project is because I couldn't keep

209
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,689
up with a machine learning course at

210
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:10,579
work um so there was a couple courses

211
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:13,459
that work for me the first one is this

212
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,290
machine learning for artists course by

213
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,559
Jean Cogan he's really influential

214
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,800
creative machine learning artist and he

215
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,480
teaches at NYU but he puts all his

216
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,199
course works online for free and so I

217
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,600
just watching the videos for the course

218
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,269
it really opens my eyes to what artists

219
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:34,490
and non-traditional technologists are

220
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,629
doing like playing Tetris with fate your

221
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:41,269
face and it really inspired me and gave

222
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:42,529
me a lot of ideas on how I could

223
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,779
integrate machine learning into a new

224
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:48,350
project and then because I'm a

225
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,449
JavaScript developer of course like I

226
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:51,949
wanted to do everything in JavaScript

227
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:54,589
which in hindsight was kind of awful

228
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,470
because if it would have been a lot

229
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,959
easier just cease Python because there

230
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,899
was already stuff and tensor faux faux

231
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,370
Python was already pretty well

232
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,439
documented for the PI but I don't like

233
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,079
to make things easy for myself if you're

234
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,779
not familiar with a tensorflow it's the

235
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,350
library for training and running machine

236
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,819
learning models mainly in the browser

237
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:18,379
where you can also run it in node and

238
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:20,929
this is dan Schiffman from the coding

239
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,029
train and this is honestly how I wanted

240
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,490
to use sensor flow GS his videos are

241
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,149
great and he just basically kind of

242
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:30,589
plays around with tensor flow and that's

243
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,779
how I learned so when I started this

244
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:33,799
project I knew I wanted to use

245
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,420
JavaScript to do the machine learning

246
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,189
but there was two things I wasn't sure

247
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:39,949
of first of all I needed to run the

248
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:42,410
machine learning models in node because

249
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,480
I would be running on a PI and not in

250
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,819
the browser and then I also needed to

251
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:51,999
run these models and note on the PI and

252
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:55,490
the model I wanted to use was this model

253
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,589
called tiny yellow and yellow stands for

254
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:00,470
you only looked look once and it's

255
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,019
called tiny because it's one of the

256
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,079
image recognition libraries for the

257
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,829
browser and since the flow but yes for

258
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,389
the browser it wasn't set up for nodes

259
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,490
so the first thing you wanted to do to

260
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,690
see if I could get this model running

261
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,820
just a node so to do that I just luckily

262
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,100
just had to do some minor code changes I

263
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,199
just bought the repo for this project

264
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:27,220
and then I needed to replace use the

265
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,740
attention flow node specific package and

266
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,440
then store all the models they were

267
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,029
originally in the crowd a cloud I had to

268
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,389
store them locally changing like

269
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,529
import/export statements to require say

270
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:42,019
minutes things that you do for node and

271
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:46,670
I couldn't use like the web camera media

272
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,790
devices API I needed actually load the

273
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,029
file in node and then send it to the

274
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:57,709
model so I was able to do those things

275
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,389
you can see I was so happy I sent out a

276
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:03,230
tweet about this and yeah you can see it

277
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,079
sees it like thinks deceased ties which

278
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,760
I'm not sure why but it also saw people

279
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,279
which what was in the photo that I was

280
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:14,120
sending it so I got that done that was

281
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,370
pretty exciting but I needed to actually

282
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,140
get it didn't matter if I got it running

283
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,660
if I couldn't get tensorflow is running

284
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,329
on PI and I didn't do too much research

285
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:25,940
into this beforehand but I got pretty

286
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,410
lucky that the tensorflow J s team was

287
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,500
actually making tensorflow J s like the

288
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,660
same week I started working on this they

289
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,190
had a branch that they made the

290
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,050
architecture for the PI which is a ARM

291
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,170
architecture they were making changes

292
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,540
and they were going to allow it to be

293
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,810
ran there so it wasn't released in yet

294
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,350
but I was some help from my colleague at

295
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,630
work I was able to just clone it and

296
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,839
like use this package called y'all y'all

297
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,069
to link it to my project and as you just

298
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,139
I could build a tensor flow J s on the

299
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,890
PI and it worked

300
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,320
and I think this is like probably one of

301
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,959
the first instances of actually building

302
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,339
on that pie because it was like right

303
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,390
after they added identify so I was kind

304
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,529
of cool I was doing something like

305
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:26,500
really bleeding-edge and I have a

306
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,079
disclaimer that I haven't touched this

307
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,870
since I did this so it's running on

308
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,829
tinder fudge is 0.14 too to give you

309
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,459
context the latest release is 1.2 0.8

310
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:40,810
and they're also prepping release

311
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,269
candidate too but you know what I did

312
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,240
this months ago it's for my project

313
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,450
it works like really I look down to make

314
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,410
sure so it works really reliably and if

315
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,360
it's not broken why fix it like I have

316
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,610
other things like in four hours into so

317
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,040
yeah so just disclaimer if you want to

318
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,920
try this yourself I'm using an older

319
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,880
version of tin so fledge is um so yeah

320
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,910
my two biggest hurdles we're done so I

321
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,070
could start working on the LED necklace

322
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,079
and as a maker I tend to just buy in

323
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,269
bulk and I always see cool things that I

324
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,880
like and I buy things a lot and I have a

325
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,570
huge drawer of just like extra things so

326
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,670
a while back I bought this kit it's like

327
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,010
an intro soldering to kit called blinky

328
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,579
tiles

329
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:34,029
it sees just shapes that you can solder

330
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:36,430
together and it comes with this pre

331
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,380
program it's meant to be used with this

332
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,899
pre-programmed

333
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:43,000
micro control that comes with it but I

334
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,899
really like the aesthetic of it and I

335
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,730
actually had played around before with

336
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,730
just using their micro controller to try

337
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,160
to use something that you're supposed to

338
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,510
create and set on your desk into a

339
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,000
wearable itself so i had made this

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,959
before this got completely destroyed

341
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,149
when i moved to berlin so I just took it

342
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:06,070
apart but I didn't want to use their

343
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,779
preset controller so um I feel like

344
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:12,310
you're gonna hear me say luckily someone

345
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,779
had did this but this is kind of like

346
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,480
how it goes with making luckily someone

347
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,899
had controlled these blinky tiles before

348
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,120
with a different Arduino and it's

349
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,190
basically using if you're familiar with

350
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,630
stage lighting and stuff there's is

351
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,940
called DMX lighting but they had used

352
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,610
this library called DMX simple and I

353
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,710
could just kind of see the code that

354
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,000
they had written for their Drina so I

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,100
was just able to kind of know what

356
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,790
microcontrollers they used and I just

357
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,820
they used a TTT board so I just bought

358
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,920
that exact board and this is just like

359
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,870
my test of making sure that I can

360
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,690
control with my own

361
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,090
Adreno and it worked and then I just set

362
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,810
out on designing what I would design I

363
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,940
wanted to make you can see like the

364
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,440
design on the left is not what I went

365
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,120
with I went with the one on the right

366
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,260
and tomatoes I just I have a mannequin

367
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,120
and I just pin a I solder on the

368
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,310
mannequin I just spin things out and cut

369
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,040
wires and it's super tedious but I just

370
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,430
do it on my mannequin um so I created

371
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,650
the LED necklace but then I needed to

372
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,620
send that image data from the PI to the

373
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,050
jury no to control the Y's and I didn't

374
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,670
want to rely on Bluetooth or anything

375
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,850
that could go wrong so I just decided I

376
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,370
wanted to hardwire it and for that I was

377
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,210
going to use serial ports I never sent

378
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,390
any messages between devices with serial

379
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,240
ports but the PI there's two pins

380
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,290
there's one for sending and receiving

381
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,660
and then I could send the data from the

382
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,700
PI or my data pins of the Drina so it

383
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,570
seemed pretty straightforward but I

384
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,520
struggled a lot so I was trying I had a

385
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,650
lot of problems just getting the serial

386
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,530
on the PI to work so I had trouble this

387
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,930
if you look at C on the Left I just have

388
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,709
a wire going into the send pin to the

389
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:08,199
receive and this is called a loopback so

390
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,120
it's how you can test that your serial

391
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,730
port is working and I spent like a week

392
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,959
and had like desperate tweets like

393
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,329
trying to figure out what was going on

394
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,329
and because you know it's like the PI is

395
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,040
supposed to be super kid friendly but I

396
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,650
had a lot of problems with this and I

397
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,520
basically just I had to change like

398
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,110
disable a bunch of stuff configuration

399
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,230
on startup and I wrote this huge gift so

400
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,490
I would like potentially remember how to

401
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,220
do this next time but yeah I basically

402
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,230
had to disable stuff like on startup

403
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,809
every time so it's like has the Pens

404
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:50,270
like active um so things were not going

405
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,220
I figured out things but things still

406
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,390
weren't going great I had some problems

407
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,070
that I needed to deal with before I can

408
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,960
move for further with like connecting

409
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,920
the two so as you can see like that is

410
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,070
like bad it's not supposed to be

411
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,040
flickering like this and at the time

412
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,800
like yeah I'm not like an electronics

413
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,679
like expert I had a hunch it was like

414
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,020
power issues but it really was like

415
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,179
outside of my abilities at the time so I

416
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,730
just switched boards with another board

417
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,590
I had and I switched from the teensy to

418
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,050
an Adreno called the Adafruit mini Metro

419
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,410
and I got lucky that this board actually

420
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,360
worked with that DMX simple library

421
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,450
because it only works with a few but

422
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,950
sometimes you don't learn things until

423
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,960
after and that's okay I got really lucky

424
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,940
but I also think it was it was a power

425
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,970
issue where like the teensy Borg is like

426
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,250
runs on 3.3 volts but it's five volt

427
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,650
tolerant but the mini Metro is has a 5

428
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,230
volt output and the blinky tall's need 5

429
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,730
volts so it just happened that it

430
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,620
matched that better but really it was

431
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,570
because I had one lying around and I got

432
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,059
really really lucky so I fixed the power

433
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:01,570
issues but then I had another problem

434
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,820
when I was running the machine learning

435
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,559
model after about 30 minutes the this is

436
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:12,080
a CH top to monitor things the memory

437
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,390
would fill up and then the swap memory

438
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,640
the Phillip which is really bad and then

439
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,730
it would crash because it had it had a

440
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,660
memory leak and I like come to my

441
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,460
program looking for like memory leaks

442
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,130
and I always just stopped I could just

443
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,990
see there was like you know a node I

444
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,620
have called at Jayenge well do you

445
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,590
remember this project I was using the

446
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,550
same SD card and Raspberry Pi and it

447
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,500
turns out this project had a memory leak

448
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,350
it was so it was running at startup with

449
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,669
I had it running with p.m. to boot and

450
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:49,910
yet

451
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,620
this one had a memory leak but because

452
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,290
they were both called a PJs it was kind

453
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,790
of hard to debug yes so I figured out

454
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,390
that and I turned off the other no js'

455
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,340
half elf is running and then it was okay

456
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,770
yeah so I I got those bugs fixed up so

457
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,510
then I could get back to actually

458
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,830
sending this data from the PI to the

459
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,140
lights and then how did another the

460
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,660
decision to make so what formats would I

461
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,240
use to send data from the PI to the

462
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,090
lights and as a JavaScript developer I'm

463
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,010
like hey I just use JSON every year I'll

464
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,250
just use JSON here and yet JSON on

465
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,510
Torino is a thing there's a library um

466
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,230
and it worked but in retrospect this was

467
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,650
a really bad decision because adrenals

468
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,310
are tiny they're very like limited and

469
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,880
resources of memory wise and the lights

470
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,630
would pause while it was processing and

471
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,940
parsing the JSON it received and I

472
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,270
thought I was so clever for using JSON

473
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,570
on a Adreno but it was just a really bad

474
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,410
decision on my part so I had to redo

475
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,540
this and this is code from my nodejs

476
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,240
app so I switched to I had to think

477
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,220
about what really the Arduino needed I

478
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,200
didn't need an object with like

479
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,760
information about all the things that

480
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,340
the camera was seeing I just needed

481
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,040
really to know how many people it was

482
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,500
seeing so to do that and to do that I

483
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,140
only really needed a byte I needed a

484
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,710
number so I condensed it down and I'm

485
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,200
just sending three bytes now to the

486
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,720
adrenal so I have just a starting and

487
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,720
end by just so on the drain oh it knows

488
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,400
when it because some over serial just

489
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,260
gets a lot of garbage and so it knows

490
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,570
these bytes is getting an incoming

491
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,540
message and then the second the one in

492
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,130
the middle is just the number of people

493
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,980
and the tiny yellow model only can

494
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,140
categorise up to 20 things so I wouldn't

495
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,760
I know I knew that a byte would be

496
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,980
sufficient for that so

497
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,230
Oh finally I could send information and

498
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,780
then it was time to work on programming

499
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,490
the lights and this is just a lot of

500
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,030
like non JavaScript C++ ish

501
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,920
Audrina stuff and thankfully like

502
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,750
Charlie showed a little bit of Adreno

503
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,280
cosy so you can see there was like a

504
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,500
setup and then there's a loop and inside

505
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,710
this loop I have some methods that are

506
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,990
checking one is receiving you can know

507
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,490
if it's receiving a message and things

508
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,030
and this is I just want to show a

509
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,970
snippet of code so this is some code I

510
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,900
wrote that when it knows is receiving a

511
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,430
message and they can call this like set

512
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,750
program method and basically I wanted to

513
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,630
show that when there's no one around I

514
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,810
have this like it's really chaotic and

515
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,150
then as the people there sees more

516
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,450
people then it goes to more gentle light

517
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,470
program and then eventually it goes to

518
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,450
dark mode once they're sixty people and

519
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,160
if you're interested in looking at

520
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,310
adrena code this is the link for that I

521
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,220
also have the links to my project at the

522
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,860
end if you don't catch it in time and so

523
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,810
I had it sending things but then I had

524
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,400
another problem because this is like

525
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,940
this is how Hardware goes so I had just

526
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,370
been testing it on my mannequin but then

527
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,400
when I actually put it on myself it was

528
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,920
having some fit issues so like as I

529
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,870
moved it was like flashing because like

530
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,850
some of the wires were like shorting out

531
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,270
and I originally envisioned putting all

532
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,030
the tech and just like a sani pack not

533
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,670
really not realizing how big a pie and a

534
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,560
battery pack and everything was so it

535
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,420
was no way that I was gonna fit and look

536
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,910
cool and I have fanny pack um so I had

537
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,360
to resolder something so after I started

538
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,710
stopped crying about that I just

539
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,360
restarted and that was fine and then I

540
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,550
decided to just kind of strap everything

541
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,390
to my body on the skirt oh and this

542
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,740
actually works quite well

543
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,920
and solves the problem of like too much

544
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,740
stuff um and then I decided to add one

545
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,000
more feature that hadn't really planned

546
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,370
for so sometimes I get really

547
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,150
overwhelmed wearing this and I just want

548
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,120
a way to turn it off completely and give

549
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,620
myself a break without having to be

550
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,120
around people so I added this button

551
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,670
ring because so I have two things I can

552
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,250
do with the button ring um the first is

553
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,850
I can flip the light programs so it's

554
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,630
actually when I'm around no one it's off

555
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,820
and then as more people come around and

556
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,559
gets more chaotic so I just completely

557
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,650
flips them if I do this short button and

558
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,010
then it can come back on and then when I

559
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,450
just get completely exhausted by

560
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,950
everything I can do a long button press

561
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,540
and I can just completely turn it off

562
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,260
but then I can turn it back on just to

563
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,179
like it's kind of like my escape hatch

564
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:18,030
if I just can't rip this off of me and I

565
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:25,220
just and that's it

566
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,200
this project was hard and I got

567
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,900
demotivated a lot it's I originally

568
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,640
envisioned doing this in three months

569
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,040
and it took me eight months not because

570
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,350
I was working on it constantly but

571
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,360
because I took like some month-long

572
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,580
breaks because some of these problems

573
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,030
like the messaging and the power issues

574
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,559
and things like recently wore me down

575
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,910
and of course as always stuff I could

576
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,760
have done differently but I'm really

577
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,240
happy with what I've learned and I'm

578
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,429
excited to continue doing machine

579
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,220
learning things with wearables and other

580
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,340
projects and I love to talk about non

581
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,640
tech stuff dogs fashion all the outfits

582
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,920
of the day any of those things but we

583
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,040
can talk about tech to just if you're

584
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,980
around and you want to say hi just I

585
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,770
know I can look unfriendly sometimes but

586
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,750
I'm actually friendly I'm just nervous

587
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,140
most of the time so say hi and that's it

588
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,430
thank you so much
