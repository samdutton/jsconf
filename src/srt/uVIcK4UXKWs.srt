00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,660

good morning everybody hope you're awake

2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,260
and I talk really fast and mumble a lot

3
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,150
so if there's any questions just come

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,669
see me afterwards we're here to talk

5
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:29,890
about insecure web apps since Crockfords

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,570
not here I'm the guy to yell at you

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,559
about security and I lied in the in the

8
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:37,120
title of talk there's no three easy

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,080
steps there's there's a whole pile of

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,850
mistakes and mistakes that we can go

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,800
through all right so who am i I'm Adam

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,719
Baldwin i founded a company called

13
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,440
ingenuity we do a pen testing of web

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,079
applications networks things like that

15
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,520
we break all of the stuff that you guys

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,430
build I am in no way qualified to give a

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,530
talk on code or developing or anything

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,289
like that I build really really horrible

19
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:08,289
apps I'm better at breaking them which

20
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:11,560
is why I'm talking about that I also in

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,869
the curator of evil packet net which has

22
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:17,140
some video demonstration of abusing web

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,840
applications there's a pile of web

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,580
well-known applications out there and

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,619
stuff we've done evil things to just

26
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,939
some of our clients on the bottom there

27
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,100
I'm going to try to really really really

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,439
not like this guy I'm going to try to

29
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,790
not yell at you and complain but you'll

30
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,759
you'll hopefully respect or understand

31
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,490
my side of things and I'm for most of

32
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,570
you in the room i'm probably going to be

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,590
talking about things that you're not

34
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,030
going to want to hear about you really

35
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,020
like well we hear about this all the

36
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,780
time this stuff that this is this is

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,460
stuff that we're always getting brushed

38
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,079
with and i know how to solve this

39
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,630
problem but the reality is is of it is

40
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,430
the mistakes are still being made we're

41
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,170
still running into this stuff and this

42
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,180
what i'm going to talk about the just

43
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,530
kind of some basic things output

44
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,979
encoding hashtag navigation and piles of

45
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,470
other crap is these mistakes still keep

46
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,079
getting made not only to mention that

47
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:15,900
we're taking javascript which has been a

48
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,850
typically a client-side thing and we're

49
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,920
going to be taking it and and shoving it

50
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,450
into the server side so now we're going

51
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,459
to have developers that are experienced

52
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,440
the client-side dealing with server-side

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,449
problems and so we have a whole new

54
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,690
class of issues that are going to happen

55
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,980
security issues so so writing insecure

56
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,930
apps you guys you guys have a really

57
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,850
really difficult problem oh yeah I don't

58
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,100
always test my code but I when I do it I

59
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,140
do it in production that sound like any

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,090
any of you we see it a lot and I don't

61
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,710
know if there's a solution around it but

62
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,610
so you guys have a really really hard

63
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,380
our problem when it comes to developing

64
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,760
and developing securely you you you only

65
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,520
have to find one way to screw up and the

66
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,810
security guys in the security community

67
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,670
point laughs right like like we're just

68
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,020
a bunch of dicks and we just say haha

69
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,370
you've got cross-site scripting and and

70
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,140
you know fix it so you're also

71
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,840
resource-constrained you you you won't

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,580
we have we as an attacker have to find

73
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,370
one way and you have to find all of the

74
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,810
all you have to solve all the problems

75
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,970
as well as not only being resource

76
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,010
constraint time money your manager

77
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,910
breathing on your neck to just ship it

78
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,800
the landscape is always changing html5

79
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,860
is a set in stone standard right right

80
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,930
yeah it's always going to be changing

81
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,760
and so you're going to have a whole pile

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,950
of new problems to deal with with every

83
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,840
day not to mention you're trying to just

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,970
get your feature out or you're trying to

85
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,920
just innovate and that's that's the last

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,720
problem is engineering versus innovation

87
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,830
right like you guys I had a conversation

88
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,890
with one our clients and yet and I you

89
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,330
know I was the typical security guy and

90
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,360
I said hey output output and code this

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,610
particular field in his comment back was

92
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,519
I haven't secured it yet I haven't got

93
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,820
there yet and what we find a lot at

94
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,470
ingenuity while while we're assessing

95
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,030
applications is that that that yet never

96
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,330
comes it's a to-do line it's it's the

97
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,730
famous last words right to do input

98
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,850
validation to do output encoding you

99
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,950
know check this check that and I hate to

100
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,540
be the guy to kind of rant about it but

101
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,960
it never gets done for starters stop

102
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,520
using to do's and use an actual bug

103
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,530
tracker that's that's that's a good

104
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,250
start so I really respect what you guys

105
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,200
do from a code perspective and I'm

106
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,280
really I

107
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,800
really think that the security community

108
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,600
and the development unity you need to

109
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,060
need to interact more and we as security

110
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,040
people need to understand what you guys

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,630
what's cool things you guys are building

112
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,880
and and I really want to have some

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,200
discussion after this talk with people

114
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,810
on how their team is handling security

115
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,139
how how you think that that you guys do

116
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,030
it right that you guys you guys don't do

117
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,680
it and maybe that's the way you do it

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,419
and that's just because of constraints

119
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,280
I'd really like to have some of those

120
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,300
conversations come out of doing this as

121
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,960
for I also think that that developers

122
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,910
need to take a little more

123
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,040
responsibility when it comes to security

124
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,260
and think about it and the problem is is

125
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,550
again your resource constraints so you

126
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,050
get to the end of a project where

127
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,410
security is usually applied and you just

128
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,150
ship it now you're moving on to cool

129
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,000
project x instead of you know dealing

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,520
with the as was mentioned in some of the

131
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,130
earlier talks you know dealing with the

132
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,360
the code that you just don't want to

133
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,770
work on because it's it's not cool it's

134
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,680
old and it's old and flabby right so so

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,180
here's the first thing that I see gets

136
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,520
screwed up as I went over all of the

137
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,810
assessment reports we've done for the

138
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,700
last couple of years there's two things

139
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,979
that stood out was hash you know kind of

140
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,010
a hash navigation or a shebang

141
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,650
navigation and output encoding and

142
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,120
there's a unicorn so the the reality is

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,760
is I see this done wrong in two

144
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,400
different ways and it's really easy to

145
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,140
get right and a lot of places do get it

146
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,910
right but it's just done wrong so you

147
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,830
have you have a URL right like you know

148
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,070
twitter com / you know hash and then a

149
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,250
resource and you get that Reese and the

150
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,690
Ajax just says go get that resource

151
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,820
right we're all pretty much familiar

152
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,380
with how that works right a lot of

153
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,910
places just don't bother to check that

154
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,440
there's I don't know a slash at the

155
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,780
beginning and so then you just go and it

156
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,910
says just get whatever resource that is

157
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,820
and they don't they don't tack on a vein

158
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,430
or they don't tack on anything at the

159
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,010
beginning so you put in a you know a

160
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,979
payload like this you know to evil site

161
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,590
in and I've argued with a lot of people

162
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,789
and they say well that won't work

163
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,740
because it's cross domain right

164
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,910
it just doesn't work we'll get guess

165
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,509
what of course headers allow that and my

166
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,220
evil site just sets that nice core

167
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,240
course header and and it works and the

168
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,009
other way I see it done right is that

169
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:13,500
they don't they they're checking for or

170
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,300
they don't check for HTTP so you so you

171
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,009
end up building a big long domain like

172
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,919
example com evil packet net resource and

173
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,509
you just do something like that and it

174
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:26,069
gets built out those are the two ways I

175
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:28,860
see it I'm going to attempt to do just

176
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,560
the demo just just to show kind of what

177
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,090
it would look like a really simple

178
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,590
cheesy demo that will probably fail

179
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,440
miserably okay so it has tests that's

180
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,099
the standard content we can win a life

181
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:55,289
test look at that resource great that

182
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,440
resources you know maps whatever and of

183
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,310
course we put in something you look at

184
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,300
the people pack it down net / cores and

185
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,570
we can see that it's going to not work

186
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:15,959
right

187
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:22,620
boom

188
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,000
all right live demo fail well what I was

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,830
going to show is that oh yeah I didn't

190
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:39,760
go get it Oh aha my app sucks so now

191
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,289
I'll actually work it just displays an

192
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,510
alert box saying that it executes a code

193
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,040
in the context of local I was great you

194
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,080
know window dot location but if you'll

195
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,270
actually look at the headers and I'm I

196
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,220
apologize because I'm not smart as Paul

197
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,660
Irish and I can't make this font bigger

198
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,670
I don't think I don't know how to do

199
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,120
that so if you actually look at the

200
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,470
headers that's coming back and this is

201
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:05,170
really hard to see there is a response

202
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,530
header access control allow origin star

203
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,750
that's all I have to set for four cores

204
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,970
and so just the point of that it's

205
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,040
really easy for an attacker once we if

206
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,900
you do this wrong to to execute code

207
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,970
within the context or application the

208
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,650
uneven packet there's a really

209
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,160
complicated example of our do had had

210
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,000
this problem when they came in beta and

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,580
and it shows some more complicated

212
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,080
execution flow for that cross-site

213
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,360
scripting everyone everyone's plagued by

214
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,200
this problem right like we don't want to

215
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,550
hear about cross-site scripting at least

216
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,390
at least that's what I hear from

217
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,560
developers when I talk to them they're

218
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,480
like it's probably just want to get go

219
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,690
away right or my templating framework

220
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,060
takes care of that the guys in the

221
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,620
Django community say well my templating

222
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,180
takes care of that rail says my template

223
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,620
thing takes care of that Express and

224
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,050
Jade takes care of that right well guess

225
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,940
what it doesn't if you up your

226
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,010
templates you're going to have a problem

227
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,350
and the reality is is this is this is

228
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,540
the reason all of these things encode

229
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,510
those five characters quotes greater

230
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,950
than less than single quote & ampersand

231
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,770
and if you put if you write shitty HTML

232
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,340
like down at the bottom there it you

233
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,570
don't need any of those things to

234
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,070
actually execute code it's just not

235
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,089
required the other things people forget

236
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,200
is that you can write Java code

237
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,940
JavaScript without letters and numbers

238
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,520
alphanumeric JavaScript

239
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,630
so depending on what you're actually

240
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,360
encoding it's contextually aware context

241
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,350
matters of where you're actually

242
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,930
cramming cramming your stuff into your

243
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,930
templates and you guys do some really

244
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,760
creative stuff with templating and and

245
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,940
sticking stuff where I would not

246
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,310
normally think think about it and in

247
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,960
this stuff matters well there's some

248
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,250
really there's some really elegant

249
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,790
solutions to solving this problem jquery

250
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,820
encoders go one way again don't write

251
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,220
your own quarters it use the stuff

252
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,050
that's out there we're trying to build a

253
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,000
wasp is trying to build their enterprise

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,940
security API to solve this problem to

255
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,860
make it easy so that there's a set of

256
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,260
encoders that you guys can just use and

257
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,520
you don't have to reinvent the wheel and

258
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,290
potentially screw it up they say the

259
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,580
same thing with cryptography don't write

260
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,920
your own crypto because math is hard

261
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,650
encoders are hard as well and here's a

262
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,330
simple example which I'm not going to

263
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,790
bother to go over but it just says

264
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,890
encode for HTML and they've got

265
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,480
different context is like in code for

266
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,760
CSS and code for JavaScript depending on

267
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,680
where you're actually dumping that that

268
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,530
input or that output and that's the

269
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,090
other thing is is that this is not in

270
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,460
putting not input validation we always

271
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,840
talk about input validation input

272
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,720
validation I feel is for the end user

273
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,590
you're going to give them a pretty

274
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,240
little message and tell them that there

275
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,480
that there that they put in a malformed

276
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,580
email address or something output

277
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,560
encoding is about sending it to a

278
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,390
different system so you're taking this

279
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,880
piece of out the this this piece of data

280
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,500
and you're sending it to a system a

281
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,240
browser is a system a sequel server

282
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,580
system and depending on where you're

283
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,470
sending it what complex system xmpp

284
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,350
server whatever you need to encode it

285
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,640
properly to send it to that system

286
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,790
that's output encoding and and it can be

287
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,090
a really really complicated process the

288
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,740
other thing is and I really really if

289
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,810
anybody from chrome team can can push

290
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,460
this on the chrome side I would love to

291
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,930
see it it just it's a new feature in

292
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,330
Firefox force content security policy as

293
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,740
anybody aware of content security policy

294
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,930
a couple people that's good content

295
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,700
security policy is is is pretty badass

296
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,830
it basically says that you can define

297
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,250
where you want scripts to run it and you

298
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,250
can say I only want to

299
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,580
load and execute scripts from my domain

300
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,580
inline scripts can piss off stuff from

301
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,050
other domains can just go away it's not

302
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,180
going to be executed as well as there's

303
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,380
there's a way if you want actually

304
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,970
implement this and test your app to see

305
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,200
where things would break there's

306
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,670
actually a way to just record the events

307
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,050
instead of actually blocking them so you

308
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,670
can say in the console you're going to

309
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,330
see how these things actually fail

310
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,040
another more complicated example would

311
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,870
be if i wanted to load different types

312
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,220
of objects so there's different types of

313
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,780
classification of objects objects and

314
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,510
scripts and images and things like that

315
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,980
and so you can you can define all this

316
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,090
content where you want it to come from

317
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,800
it gives you more control over things

318
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,060
that you're loading up on to up onto

319
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,110
your your page again I this is you might

320
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,580
say well I'm not just targeting Firefox

321
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,900
where I'm not just targeting chrome or

322
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,390
it doesn't solve my problem completely

323
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,550
but it makes it harder if you actually

324
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,580
implement a Content security policy on

325
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,710
your site guess what you're you may have

326
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,480
cross-site scripting problems but it's

327
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,040
only going to affect a portion of your

328
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,660
users you're going to be doing one

329
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,290
better than then somebody else and that

330
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,760
might be enough to make just somebody go

331
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,580
make an attacker go away it's kind of

332
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,700
like the the story of two guys in the

333
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,440
woods being being chased by a bear and

334
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,820
the guy takes a break to put on his

335
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,110
running shoes and his buddies like

336
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,910
asking what the hell are you doing why

337
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,800
just have to run faster than you you

338
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,839
just have to do better and that's the

339
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,339
truth is you can't have a hundred

340
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:21,370
percent secure site it's not possible

341
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,360
security is not a hundred percent thing

342
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,580
we all know that we all get that so it's

343
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,780
all about just doing better

344
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,570
understanding where you're at understand

345
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,800
where your organization at where you are

346
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
as a developer whether you give a damn

347
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,460
or not and just do better and I blew

348
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,380
through that amazingly fast so we'll

349
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,050
chat about some other stuff here

350
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,120
cross-site request forgery I see a lot

351
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,780
of people doing setting data actually

352
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,450
doing just not getting resources with

353
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,790
get I do doing privileged actions with

354
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,300
get it's a horrible idea don't do it

355
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,940
things like example.com / delete my

356
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,769
account

357
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,920
you know ID equals with a get and not

358
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,509
not bothering instead we just have we

359
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:05,920
just have a pop-up window it says do you

360
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,939
accept okay that's that's not really

361
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:11,800
necessarily adequate there's great

362
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,459
implementations out there Express

363
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:19,449
Express has a CSRF plugin I would look

364
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:21,339
if I were developing and I would look at

365
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:22,540
some of the models that are out there in

366
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,209
Django and in rails and and take their

367
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,410
model and implement that clickjacking

368
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,749
clickjacking totally gets a you know

369
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:33,269
most people think thats related to flash

370
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:36,269
and that type of things it circumvents

371
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,139
first of all if you have cross-site

372
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,249
scripting if you have if you have an

373
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:40,899
injection point near applications your

374
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,639
CSRF cross-site request forgery

375
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,279
protection is crap it's not going to

376
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,699
work it'sit's overwritten if you can

377
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,959
frame your application and you've got

378
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,149
click to basically allow for

379
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:53,439
clickjacking if you don't have frame

380
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,299
breakout code which frame breakout code

381
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:58,209
is not not perfect researchers have

382
00:15:58,209 --> 00:15:59,679
proven time and again that that can be

383
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,929
that can be broken so there's a neat

384
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:04,779
little header the x frame options header

385
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,910
that you can set and you can say what

386
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,709
sites can frame your app if you're a

387
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,029
site that you never want your crap

388
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:12,850
framed set the header you click jacking

389
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,769
is just going to fail miserably it's not

390
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:19,990
going to be possible cookies I see a lot

391
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,939
of whoring cookies around in JavaScript

392
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:27,549
and don't do it it's that HTTP only set

393
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:32,499
secure flag use HTTPS and I guess any

394
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:34,389
questions anybody want to argue with me

395
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:37,899
or heckle me I'm yeah I'm this time the

396
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,360
security guy so just so you can you can

397
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,200
heckle I'm okay

398
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,860
okay so so clickjacking is clickjacking

399
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,080
is where you take a page and put in a

400
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,300
frame and make it invisible and then

401
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,540
make it follow the mouse cursor so

402
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,710
wherever you click you're going to click

403
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,000
on the button that I want you to click

404
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,850
on so one nice nun one nice thing about

405
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,400
forms that get filled out by like the

406
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,930
URL where you where you put you know

407
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,850
your form information the URL and it

408
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,579
gets populated I can just frame that URL

409
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,020
up and then make you hover over the

410
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,699
button that I want and it's invisible

411
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,650
and so when you click you actually click

412
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,180
through to that to that that frame so so

413
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,250
what happens is you're on you're on my

414
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,230
you know evil packet net and I'm I'm

415
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,780
really you know have facebook underneath

416
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,100
there so that you like me or whatever

417
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,350
and so when you click Facebook of course

418
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,710
has some protections against that but

419
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,250
that's one that's one example I I'm not

420
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,800
ready to do a demo of it but you see me

421
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,100
after I can show you a demo or something

422
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,760
if not that is it and see me after four
