1
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:20,900

you

2
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,500
yeah my name is Andy Hall I came from

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,140
Adobe Japan um I'm actually been a

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,070
couple of years since I gave us a

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,390
presentation in English but I'm sure

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,730
it's like falling off a bike so yeah and

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,730
my talk today is on server-side nodejs

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,090
programming with Photoshop so yeah

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,260
that's my self introduction I'm gonna

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,470
skip past it um this is a JavaScript

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,879
conference and obviously we all want to

12
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,320
talk about javascript so I know you're

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,550
all sitting there thinking why isn't

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,739
anybody talking about Photoshop yet well

15
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,260
finally the wait is over I'm gonna spend

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,670
the next 45 minutes like my Photoshop

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,729
but not really because actually I've not

18
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:54,960
I barely know how to use it cuz I'm a

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,699
programmer and I'm not a designer like a

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,909
like regarder said but it turns out for

21
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,379
various historical reasons Photoshop is

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,640
a tool that's been around like 25 years

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,260
it's if you're not familiar with it it

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,500
has to do with manipulating images but

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,270
for various historical reasons it's got

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,950
like three or four possibly five

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,900
different JavaScript interpreters built

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,220
into it for various sorts of

29
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,960
extensibility things and stuff like that

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,270
and there's a newest one that's just

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,409
come out about two months ago I think

32
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,580
it's based on node.js and that's what

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,740
I'm going to talk about there are

34
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,810
several things interpreters built-in for

35
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,880
various reasons one of them that I'm

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,760
going to focus on today is a there's a

37
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,650
VM called extend script and I think this

38
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,910
is back in the day when JavaScript well

39
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,590
you know it was only sort of half a

40
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,480
thing extended script has been in

41
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,860
Photoshop for ever and ever it's the way

42
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,100
you hook into all the Photoshop API is

43
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,390
if you want to like blur an image

44
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,270
there's a layer blur sort of API it's

45
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,950
the way that you create on Photoshop

46
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,660
extensions and I'm not going to go into

47
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,460
any detail on it at all but it leaves

48
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,540
somewhere in Photoshop and there's this

49
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,980
thing that you can access and there's

50
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,420
this layer on top of it called Kevlar

51
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,320
kfl like K of K V L R which is a kind of

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,820
a socket based interface and I'm not

53
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,110
gonna get into that stuff I'm gonna

54
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,340
gloss it over but there's several

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,220
different moving parts in there but what

56
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,480
has just recently shipped about two

57
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,980
months ago is that there's now an

58
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,050
instance of nodejs built into the

59
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,909
photoshop executable so anybody who's

60
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,040
running the current version there's an

61
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,989
odious someone their background and the

62
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,340
reason for that is it's purely as an

63
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,140
extensibility mechanism the idea is that

64
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,730
uh it's called generators the name of

65
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,220
the feature and the idea is that

66
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,870
underneath that instance of node there's

67
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,000
an app called generator core which is

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,109
built into Photoshop and runs

69
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:29,879
automatically and that app will load in

70
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,040
other nodejs apps and run them as float

71
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,330
as buggins

72
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,380
and that's what I want to talk about

73
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,420
today so the architecture I'll get to in

74
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:36,870
a minute

75
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,120
um first of all I want to show you what

76
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,740
the smart people at Adobe did with this

77
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,810
technology to show off it's sort of

78
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,000
reason for existing and this is my first

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,490
demo um when you start Photoshop if it's

80
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,630
the newest version it will have this

81
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,880
thing in the file menu called generate

82
00:02:50,880 --> 00:03:00,260
image assets and the way it works is you

83
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,030
I'll just start up my trusty Photoshop

84
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,600
at this super maximum inhuman resolution

85
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,770
and and elope in a PSD and this is a PSD

86
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,290
that me the non designer made it's let's

87
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,580
just imagine for the sake of argument

88
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,200
that it's a website because this is

89
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,670
actually how websites mostly get made

90
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,500
like 95% of websites these days still

91
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,790
the designer lays it out in Photoshop

92
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,920
because there aren't that many good

93
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,030
design tools for HTML 5 which is

94
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,800
something we're working on but let's say

95
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,180
for the sake of argument got a designer

96
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,540
he's made this website in Photoshop and

97
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,739
usually everything is separated out on

98
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,420
layers and you've got all this like you

99
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,410
know the backgrounds a layer and

100
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,459
everything like that and then what

101
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,900
usually happens is he throws this at a

102
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,070
developer and the developer has to go

103
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,570
through and break out all the layers

104
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,310
into different pieces and apply styles

105
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,480
and then you know figure out the

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,680
architecture of the site based on the

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,620
design etc etc and um we don't have a

108
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,300
complete fix for that but one thing that

109
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,360
makes it a little easier is this

110
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,530
generator plug-in that comes like I said

111
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,110
built in and oh it's already turned on

112
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,180
so image assets is turned on and then

113
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,080
what you do is music amount so I can

114
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,830
maybe see the desktop as well I'll put

115
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,530
it like that so I've got a file browser

116
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,739
open on my desktop and inside this

117
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,299
Photoshop file I will take a like

118
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,030
foreground and this this is a layer name

119
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,470
is just the thing that design is used to

120
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,330
you know keep track of the assets I'll

121
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,700
make it layer name dot ping so

122
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,790
foreground ping and then over here in my

123
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,640
file browser next to the PSD a folder

124
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,770
has been made called SS and it's sort of

125
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,240
automatically generated this file called

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,600
photo or foreground dot ping which looks

127
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:39,990
like that

128
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,320
and then if I go back into Photoshop and

129
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,630
I let's say I want to get all designer

130
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,470
II and

131
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,440
like their I'm a designer look hey hey

132
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,600
so and the the image in the background

133
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,070
was updated live based on the way the

134
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,380
design works and the idea is that it

135
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,880
facilitates this whole process of

136
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,500
breaking your comp into little pieces

137
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,970
and putting all those pieces in the

138
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,160
website and that's that's great I mean

139
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,050
it's a really good I guess something for

140
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,270
designers it's not something that I use

141
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,540
in my work but going back to here

142
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,990
um the plus to this is that it's really

143
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,250
useful it solves people's problems and

144
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,840
in fact my colleague demoed this at an

145
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,130
ad agency and one of the people there

146
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,340
like literally cried I'm told so it's

147
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,260
really useful um but I have a big

148
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,730
problem with it because I'm a developer

149
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,900
engine evangelist and the problem is

150
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,700
this thing is it's just a useful thing

151
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,960
that makes people's lives better I don't

152
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,550
want that I want I want something that

153
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,140
you know looks like a crazy weird demo

154
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,840
and and serves no purpose so I made

155
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,160
something that looks like a crazy weird

156
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,300
demo and serves no purpose and that's

157
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,600
what I want to show you today um because

158
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,460
the point is that this thing that I just

159
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,040
showed I mean it publishes images but

160
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,140
it's not a feature to publish those

161
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,000
images the feature is that it's got this

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,380
whole extensibility layer and you can

163
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,850
sort of hook into it and do anything you

164
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,240
want so that's what I did so I will

165
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,860
close that and I'll make a new file and

166
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,700
make a recently sized file and now in

167
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,620
the background I will do something which

168
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,710
will I will explain in a moment in this

169
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:29,350
super super small resolution I will

170
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,689
okay I'll run this weird no js' command

171
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,250
and now something is running in the

172
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,509
background and and something has

173
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:38,210
happened and what has happened so far is

174
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,270
only one thing this file this is really

175
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,620
hard to deal with this resolution um

176
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,370
the file now has a new menu option

177
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,710
called awesome mode because it's awesome

178
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,620
that's why it's called awesome mode so I

179
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,419
turn that on and now some stuff is

180
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,639
happening in this node window and now

181
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,129
pay attention because this is what we're

182
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:59,689
about to see is I think basically the

183
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,639
future of Photoshop right I'm gonna zoom

184
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,310
in over here on the layer screen and

185
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,690
hopefully it'll work because I haven't

186
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,099
tried it in this room and sometimes it

187
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:08,889
works and sometimes it doesn't

188
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:15,050
okay Photoshop new layer see you do a

189
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,719
demo and it doesn't work what happens

190
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,139
all right what's going nuts

191
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:29,010
okay Photoshop okay photoshopped

192
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,680
okay Photoshop this is crazy

193
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,009
hold on okay Photoshop I've never had it

194
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:46,779
not work this well one okay Photoshop

195
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,400
why it does not work

196
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:57,119
okay this is really strange

197
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,860
okay Photoshop

198
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,850
I do not know why this would happen one

199
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:32,230
moment this is a nightmare

200
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,370
okay Photoshop

201
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:42,660
okay Photoshop Thanks new layer ah what

202
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:56,340
is it doing okay Photoshop this is

203
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,380
really crazy all right we're going to

204
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,000
change plans slightly I'm going to jump

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,670
into the code so I can make it not um I

206
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,650
can make it stop looking at those other

207
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,110
commands so let's pretend that demo

208
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,910
worked because it's clearly doing

209
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,760
something here what it's doing is it's

210
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,290
doing voice recognition and then in

211
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,300
theory that would have it would have

212
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,560
understood me saying okay Photoshop and

213
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,030
then it would have done like new layer

214
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,440
would make a new layer and random color

215
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,120
would make a cloud random color and

216
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,560
things like that so wow that was quite a

217
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:37,890
demo right so right really the guts are

218
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,440
working there's a some tuning to be done

219
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,750
possibly with acoustics but to move on

220
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,220
to the architecture so like I said

221
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,170
what's happening is inside Photoshop

222
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,790
there's this node application called

223
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,290
generator core that loads in and runs

224
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,610
other applications which are the plugins

225
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,830
the thing that I did in the terminal is

226
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,500
that you can also run over here on the

227
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,850
right side you can run your own instance

228
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,460
of node and then run in that instance a

229
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,870
separate copy of the generator core

230
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,370
application and then you can load in

231
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,140
separate plugins and the reason you can

232
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,580
do that is because like I said the

233
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,900
beginning there there was this

234
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,630
pre-existing sort of socket based

235
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,650
communication layer called Kevlar at the

236
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,750
top and both versions of generator core

237
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,310
hooked through that and that's why you

238
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,540
can have sort of multiple versions of it

239
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,430
but it's basically dev mode and you know

240
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,990
installed mode so if you're going to

241
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,420
roll out like I think my plugin as you

242
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,100
can see it's basically finished so if I

243
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,120
was going to roll that out to the world

244
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,890
they could put it inside their Photoshop

245
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,880
plugins directory and they wouldn't have

246
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,680
to run their own node command but when

247
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,670
you run it separately you can use a

248
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,870
different version a node or anything you

249
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,410
like so and that's why that command

250
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,730
happened um so moving out of the code I

251
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,950
will open a code editor this sum by the

252
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,600
way this is the decoded or I like best

253
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,650
at the moment is something called

254
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,140
brackets which is

255
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,390
this is um made internally at Adobe but

256
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,650
it's an open-source project and it's

257
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,540
it's an editor that's sort of

258
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,700
specialized for JavaScript and HTML and

259
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,640
CSS and it's actually made in JavaScript

260
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
and CSS as well so it's I think the only

261
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,700
editor where if you want to jump in and

262
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,280
change the code it's all HTML possibly

263
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,910
and I'll make it like super large for

264
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,650
this resolution yeah so and in here I'm

265
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,140
looking at the source of my awesome as

266
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,940
you can see it obviously awesome plugin

267
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,330
I'm inside here there is this is just a

268
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,740
regular node application as a

269
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,170
package.json and there's stuff in there

270
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,670
the only really important thing is to

271
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,550
declare a main function and you've got

272
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,470
one called main j/s and then inside main

273
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,200
j/s you've got you know a fairly normal

274
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,030
sort of looking node application if

275
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,320
you've ever used note this is what it

276
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,930
does and then down at the bottom

277
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:44,090
somewhere yeah all you really have to do

278
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,410
is export an init function and then

279
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,790
everything else is sort of handled by

280
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,740
this this core app that reads it in and

281
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,180
runs it for you apart from that it's a

282
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,670
completely normal vanilla node.js

283
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,110
application there's nothing magical

284
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,830
going on at all what happens inside the

285
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,250
stuff is well for example I've got a

286
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,630
package called Julius which I'll get to

287
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,830
in a second that's does the voice

288
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,760
recognition I've got some other stuff

289
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,180
and then in here somewhere in here there

290
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,690
is um various functions that do all the

291
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,050
things and if somewhere in here we see

292
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,210
yeah here's the the switch statement

293
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:22,430
that's doing all the commands and yeah

294
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,780
that's the really annoying part that's

295
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,290
causing all the trouble but getting that

296
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:33,940
back to them in a second okay now

297
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,870
pausing a moment I want to say a few

298
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,840
words about Julius which is the library

299
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,800
that I'm using for the voice recognition

300
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,630
because it's um it turns out to be kind

301
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,670
of interesting um usually if you were

302
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,660
going to try to put voice recognition

303
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,580
into an app with nodejs I think the

304
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,320
natural thing to do would to be using to

305
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,550
use an existing library that's what I

306
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,960
tried to do I couldn't find one they

307
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,370
worked very well because most of them

308
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,900
are based around the idea of piping

309
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,000
stuff out to an external service like

310
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,820
Google's speech detect service the

311
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,080
problem of that is that you tend to get

312
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,149
sort of get back anything so if you say

313
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,129
duplicate layer' you might get back the

314
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:05,480
text duplicate layer' but you might get

315
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,939
back lubricate player or whatever

316
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:09,699
because it's it's super generalized

317
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:13,430
Julius is a package that comes out of

318
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,540
Japan originally but all the stuff is

319
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,269
localized in English as well and it's a

320
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,339
sort of super generalized text on

321
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,050
recognition engine but you define your

322
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,670
own grammars and vocabularies and it

323
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,189
looks like this so inside the source you

324
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:28,670
define a piece of grammar that looks

325
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,259
like this where let's say like a

326
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:32,660
sentence can start with silence and then

327
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,779
do thank you and then silence ends or it

328
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,059
can be a PS command which is like layer

329
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,980
command layer for example and then in a

330
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,319
separate file you define a vocabulary

331
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:44,089
where you say like a layer command is

332
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,009
any of these three words and these three

333
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,990
words have these pronunciations and the

334
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,579
point of all this is and then it handles

335
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,740
all the magic of taking in an audio

336
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,259
stream and looking for these sounds but

337
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:55,370
the point of it is that it only knows

338
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,529
how to understand the commands that you

339
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,019
specifically define so if you if you

340
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,059
snap your fingers it will guess that it

341
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,220
is one of those commands that you've

342
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,779
chosen and that's why in theory I have

343
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:11,329
this very cleverly defined command chain

344
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:12,649
where you have to start by saying okay

345
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:13,759
Photoshop and then you do something else

346
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,470
because if you didn't have some kind of

347
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,970
trigger like that to start with

348
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,550
recognition then every noise would be

349
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,529
translated into like new layered or undo

350
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,730
or delete a layer or something like that

351
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,170
so um yeah so Julius is a it turned out

352
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,449
to be quite easy to work with and I

353
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:30,410
really recommend if you're doing

354
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,300
something that involves this kind of

355
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,290
thing in nodejs

356
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,910
it was really fun to get working uhm now

357
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,110
obviously this is great and going to

358
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,610
change the the face of Photoshop but

359
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,740
probably some of you have a nagging

360
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,290
question which is that wouldn't it you

361
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,790
know that wouldn't be kind of stupid if

362
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,579
everybody was like actually in a you

363
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,860
know design company with like 20 people

364
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,089
sitting in the same room using Photoshop

365
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,050
and they were all talking to their

366
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,699
machines wouldn't that be kind of stupid

367
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:58,429
the answer of it well obviously that

368
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,709
would be stupid because the Machine

369
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,839
wouldn't be answering them back right so

370
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,839
um the second feature of the demo and I

371
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,069
don't know if I can turn it on because

372
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:08,600
of this weird photo ok Photoshop stuff

373
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,910
the second feature is to have the

374
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,920
Photoshop answer back through this API

375
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,069
and let's probably more let's give it

376
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:21,920
some I'll rerun node and it's listening

377
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,970
over here again

378
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,089
I will turn awesome mode on again and do

379
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,720
I have audio okay

380
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,569
and we'll just keep this open and see if

381
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,639
it's working

382
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:45,310
okay Photoshop ok Photoshop voice mode

383
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:53,620
voice mode activated all right yeah

384
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,939
that's a big round of applause for a

385
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:58,930
very simple demo thank you very much I

386
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,009
appreciate that very very early so

387
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,829
that's obviously I'm like about five

388
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,389
lines of code in the node.js site

389
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:06,410
because all I'm doing is starting a

390
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,569
process and I'm handing it over text to

391
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:11,480
the speech or the say API which is

392
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,060
exists on Macintosh's and it looks like

393
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,639
I'll show you real quick there's yeah

394
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,850
function looks like this there's a it's

395
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,720
it's a it's using the spawn child method

396
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,100
of nodejs it's really simple you hand

397
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,380
over a line of text and it just works

398
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,329
and the great thing is if you run it on

399
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,339
a PC I don't know probably nothing

400
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:35,810
happens I've enjoyed it because it's a

401
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:41,360
demo yeah so alright moving on to

402
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,160
another architectural thing one of the

403
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,180
things that's interesting about working

404
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,160
with this kind of architecture is that

405
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,959
there are several different JavaScript

406
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,939
interpreters involved in this particular

407
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:53,149
case we have an ojs application which is

408
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,980
running inside you know vp8 is inside

409
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,430
there somewhere

410
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,880
you implement or running all the lines

411
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,980
of JavaScript somewhere inside Photoshop

412
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,059
there's a completely different VM

413
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,470
running a different it's not vp8 is

414
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,240
something much much older that's also

415
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,439
running JavaScript and when you want to

416
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,390
like make a new layer you've got to run

417
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,030
JavaScript you're in your node VM

418
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,289
running some script and you want to go

419
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:14,179
in to the Photoshop VM wherever the hell

420
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:16,490
that is and run some code that creates a

421
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,470
new layer and it turns out that it's

422
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,929
really really hard to get VMs to work

423
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:22,429
together like that and like share the

424
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:24,980
same namespace and so on but what's

425
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,569
really really easy is to pass text back

426
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,890
and forth so that's what actually

427
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,800
happens

428
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,290
in this architecture is that let's say

429
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,690
when I want to delete a layer first I

430
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,360
say I call this a function which has a

431
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,710
woman's voice saying deleting your layer

432
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,450
which is hilarious obviously and then I

433
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,310
call this function send yes and I pass

434
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,270
it an actual string of text which gets

435
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,980
sent over a socket into Photoshop and

436
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,080
somewhere inside that world this string

437
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,180
of Texas is a you know interpreted as

438
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,030
JavaScript and that would seem like a

439
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,010
really tedious way to work and it turns

440
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,390
out if you actually try it it is a

441
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,670
really tedious way to work so um the way

442
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,040
that I work around it and this is the

443
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,870
one and only JavaScript tip and

444
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,640
technique in my speech so enjoy it

445
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,000
um the way I work around that is that I

446
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,350
didn't know this if you pass a function

447
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,540
to the if you call to string on a

448
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,570
function it actually gives back the the

449
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,090
text definition of that function so if I

450
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,730
pass over a parenthesis and then a

451
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,040
function you know to string and then I

452
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,590
close the parentheses I pass in the args

453
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,790
the arguments and then I at the end yeah

454
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,080
I pass an open and close parenthesis

455
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,020
then it gets that text of that function

456
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,910
gets defined on the other side as an

457
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,890
iffy and instantly you know executed

458
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,450
with the arguments you pass over it's

459
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,520
kind of interesting and the reason I go

460
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,600
into that is because I think this kind

461
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,680
of thing is going we're going to see

462
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,100
more of it as the years go on um in fact

463
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,750
that's not even the only this isn't the

464
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,920
only time I've used that technique with

465
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,590
Photoshop in fact because um since a

466
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,500
couple of years ago we've started it in

467
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,600
Adobe at least we've started um having

468
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,440
all our come back we started doing quite

469
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,000
a lot of our sensibility stuff in html5

470
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and for example like in Photoshop you

471
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,640
have yes and hunting and hunting and

472
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:19,290
hunting and hunting and hunting and

473
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:26,480
hunting and hunting okay

474
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,559
so apparently while I was talking

475
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,210
somehow I miraculously said okay

476
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,190
Photoshop okay um oh you know what in

477
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,420
fact the one thing I forgot to mention

478
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,940
um why is it keeps you're probably

479
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,350
wondering what the hell i enhance means

480
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,030
um that was a feature I put in because

481
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,559
I'm pretty sure this is gonna make a

482
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,690
million dollars I'm going to send this

483
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,570
to a Hollywood in fact the idea is if I

484
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,330
have a photo like this right and now

485
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,130
what I'll do first the cameras aren't

486
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,750
running it right the cameras aren't

487
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,490
running and I open this photo and I uh

488
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,650
oh I'm not in Photoshop and I'll pass it

489
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,460
a filter I'll do like a uh I'll do a a

490
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,530
box blur and then yeah so I'll box blur

491
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:15,710
like three times now I run the plug-in

492
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,050
and this is going to for this demo to

493
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,809
work this is going to have to another

494
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,190
America will have to occur it for me to

495
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,640
say okay Photoshop correctly but I'll

496
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,970
turn awesome mode back on right now you

497
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,679
run your cameras right in Hollywood and

498
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,480
the enhanced feature is just hooked into

499
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,980
the undo function and earlier I've

500
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,350
learned it three times so I say okay

501
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,940
Photoshop come on

502
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:50,650
okay Photoshop Photoshop

503
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,800
I really thought that was going to work

504
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,950
okay Photoshop Wow

505
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:05,900
come on one last time work okay okay

506
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,000
photos up

507
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,030
okay photos up okay put us up

508
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:19,520
okay photos up oh god this has never

509
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,170
failed listen well sorry

510
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,550
this actually has never failed in the

511
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,290
office it must be the I don't know max

512
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,240
anyway you say okay Photoshop then you

513
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,290
say enhance enhance enhance enhance

514
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:43,160
enhance that is the applause of pity but

515
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,780
I will take it alright so back to here

516
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,920
where were we oh yeah oh and so the

517
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,240
reason I think we'll see more of this is

518
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,130
that four so Photoshop for example um

519
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,870
you can define your own panels in

520
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,160
Photoshop and then you can package them

521
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,570
up as extensions and you can sell them

522
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,760
to people and stuff like that and they

523
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,100
can inside that panel you can you know

524
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,360
define your own workflows or whatever

525
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,100
you want to do but when if you define

526
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,420
your own panel the the code that you

527
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,760
would define the panel in is html5 I'm

528
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,790
echoing really sorry about that and and

529
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,710
so that features actually been in

530
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,730
Photoshop for about two years I think

531
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,710
and the way it works is there's a little

532
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,570
implementation of chromium like the

533
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,460
chromium embedded framework and so each

534
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,170
panel that you define html5 it has a

535
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,820
little instance of Chrome thank you very

536
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,530
much Google for making a chromium

537
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,620
embedded framework free and then so that

538
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,390
kind of extensibility is already made in

539
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,880
html5 in in that case if you want to run

540
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,860
illegally or something it's the same

541
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,060
thing you have to pass a string of

542
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,250
JavaScript over to the other VM and I

543
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,140
think it's so easy and it makes so much

544
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,530
sense to embed like many web views

545
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,690
inside applications that I think we'll

546
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,890
see more and more applications taking

547
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,480
that route and then that'll mean in more

548
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,830
and more cases you'll need to be passing

549
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,030
strings of JavaScript between different

550
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,730
VMs because it makes so much sense to to

551
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,930
put in different viens for different

552
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,310
reasons and it's so very difficult to

553
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,470
get them to share the same context but

554
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:07,039
anyway

555
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:09,720
I'm moving back to this Beach so there's

556
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,570
a quick digression now which is um my

557
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,429
dream is I have a lot of books at home

558
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:16,200
my dream is that someday there could be

559
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,059
some kind of like nodejs that plugs into

560
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,950
my living room and then I could call a

561
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,450
function that would sort the books in

562
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,799
like a certain order so they could sort

563
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,649
be sorted by like color or by subject or

564
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,570
some like that and this I think goes

565
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,129
sort of to Tim's talk this morning about

566
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:30,929
the Internet of Things I mean if you

567
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,549
could do that just think what you do you

568
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:34,980
you would you spend all day hacking the

569
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,549
living room I mean it'd be so you know

570
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,019
bloody useful that you you wouldn't want

571
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,179
to do anything else but the reason I go

572
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,830
into this is that when you have a tool

573
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,509
like Photoshop and this is true of like

574
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:48,509
a lot of 3d tools a lot of video tools a

575
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:50,190
lot of like layout tools for like

576
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,419
digital publishing that kind of stuff

577
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,389
any time a tool like a design tool or a

578
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:56,039
production tool gets to a suitable level

579
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,859
of complexity then across the world

580
00:23:58,859 --> 00:23:59,970
there's going to be tens of thousands or

581
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,169
hundreds of thousand people who's sort

582
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:03,509
of their job is to use that tool for

583
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,590
eight hours a day and that's all they do

584
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,669
and that I mean that's certainly true of

585
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:07,049
Photoshop in the world it's like ad

586
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:09,139
agencies there's all they'll have them

587
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:10,830
dozens of people who do that kind of

588
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,590
work but when you take something like

589
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,389
nodejs it's that powerful and has that

590
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,769
many existing libraries and you plug it

591
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:19,019
in to a tool that's that sort of deep

592
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,629
and heavily used it it sort of achieves

593
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:23,129
the same thing as if you could plug

594
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,299
nodejs into your living room because

595
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,279
that I mean the the Photoshop UI that's

596
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,989
to those tens of thousands of people

597
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:29,009
that's their living room that's where

598
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,109
they spend all their time and so now if

599
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:32,879
you if they have a way to like I'm gonna

600
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,639
write some JavaScript you know my my PSD

601
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:37,590
has ten thousand layers and it's really

602
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,029
you know hard to manage them so I'm

603
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:40,019
gonna write a script that's going to

604
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:42,210
filter them or or whatever is necessary

605
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,070
maybe not for everybody but for me my

606
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,289
personal workflow you know it's sort of

607
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,090
for that person it's as handy as being

608
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,080
able to sort your bookshelves and that's

609
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,730
why I think the sort of thing is going

610
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,609
to happen a lot more um in Adobe it's

611
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,379
strictly a sort of early stage

612
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,090
experiment I mean it's it's a fully

613
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,649
supported feature but whether we're

614
00:24:58,649 --> 00:24:59,909
going to keep doing this in every other

615
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,470
app we make is something that I don't

616
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,350
know yet but certainly it's um the idea

617
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,970
of putting a node instance in the

618
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,070
Photoshop and being able to extend it

619
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,889
it's I think it's something that we see

620
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:11,909
it as a big success and it's something

621
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:14,009
that we really want to to roll out in

622
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:16,109
other applications and also the thing

623
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:17,580
that I mentioned before about defining

624
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,770
panels in html5 that's I think

625
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,330
about seven of our applications now like

626
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,480
flash illustrator and design a couple

627
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,610
more they all share the same sort of

628
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,620
mechanism for defining a panel in html5

629
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,460
so this sort of not nothing to do with

630
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,230
web browsers at all but defining stuff

631
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,300
in in html5 and JavaScript and using

632
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,160
that to extend tools that are

633
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,810
pre-existing I think is certainly

634
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,370
something working and continue and I

635
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,460
hope it bleeds over into other like I'm

636
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,200
3d apps and things like that

637
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:56,510
and

638
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,990
yeah so um leaving that there I have one

639
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,370
more gratuitous demo and this is another

640
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,500
thing that also makes no sense and also

641
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,880
here's the fun part

642
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,580
um may not work because it really is

643
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,410
sensitive to the way the the room is

644
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,570
designed in the way the lighting works

645
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,760
but and I'm keeping a secret even though

646
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,110
it's sitting on the screen right now

647
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,150
because it says leap so has anybody

648
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,540
tried leap motion these are these things

649
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,000
here dude yeah alright well you see what

650
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,790
it is in a second um I thought wouldn't

651
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,830
it be awesome and completely useless to

652
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,050
hook leaked motion into Photoshop and

653
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,550
the great part is I don't have to speak

654
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,970
to turn it on it's just gonna so in

655
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:45,610
theory it could in theory work might not

656
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:53,970
so I've run my node again now I have my

657
00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:03,670
application open I will make a new layer

658
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,070
now I've plugged in my leap motion now

659
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:14,600
in principle

660
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,250
you know what I need to turn on awesome

661
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,749
mode

662
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:27,800
there we go

663
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,740
here we go

664
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:42,600
yeah

665
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:50,320
alright okay so and apparently I have

666
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,580
some debug code to there in there as

667
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,169
well so yeah what's that doing um leap

668
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:58,000
motion for those of you haven't worked

669
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,230
with it yet it's a little device that

670
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,299
measures that track some space above

671
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:03,549
your above little device like that for

672
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,690
things like gestures and thing and

673
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,309
things like that it was really really

674
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,230
easy to work with and I really recommend

675
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,880
if you want to play with it in getting

676
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,990
one it's about a hundred dollars I think

677
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,889
in the u.s. in yourselves and the code

678
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:18,100
to access it winds up being very simple

679
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,529
and very well-documented and every

680
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,539
problem that I had with it turned out to

681
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:24,760
be due to the fact that it has just had

682
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,010
a big update and it the documentation

683
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,720
hasn't reflected anything that changed

684
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,139
so the big key to where is this it

685
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:36,730
turned out that the big secret to

686
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,519
working well with leach is was to use

687
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,100
the node leap jsm controller library and

688
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,139
to downgrade it to before the recent

689
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,250
update and I'm sure there's lots of

690
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,750
great stuff in the new update but it

691
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,220
isn't documented so I couldn't get it to

692
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,880
work but then what you wind up doing

693
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,179
inside leap J yes it has it communicates

694
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:57,100
over a socket but the the socket handler

695
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,990
is is very well done in it it handles

696
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,760
all its own code so all you really need

697
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,389
to do is make a listener and stuff and

698
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:09,669
then every couple of will every however

699
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:11,080
often you specify you get a frame and

700
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,700
then it hands you information about

701
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,919
things like whether that frame has some

702
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,230
fingers and how many fingers it has and

703
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,340
then if they're valid or not and then

704
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,450
you sort of parse through this code and

705
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,480
so all I'm doing here is I'm tracking

706
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,029
the fingers and then normally I draw a

707
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,649
couple of guidelines to show you where

708
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:31,149
your fingers it are and then if and then

709
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:33,639
when the you get back a 3d pointer the

710
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,789
the third number in the in the the 3d

711
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:39,970
pointer data is a Z and the Z is in this

712
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:43,510
case this access so all I'm doing is the

713
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,519
Z equals one is the access of the device

714
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,279
so every time Z goes past one I call it

715
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,269
touching and then I start drawing the

716
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:51,460
line and it's quite simple and this code

717
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,020
is up on github and I'll show you in a

718
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,890
second

719
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,910
and so it wound up this is I don't know

720
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,750
if you took out the comments this is

721
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,370
like 20 lines just to get that working

722
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,480
so now having said that is it a good way

723
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,830
to draw lines no it's a really really

724
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,330
terrible way to draw lines because it's

725
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,030
it's not that fast and the tracking is

726
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,190
not very accurate and if you actually do

727
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,600
it well first of all if you have like a

728
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,710
reflective ceiling but nothing will

729
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,090
happen because it completely fails and

730
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,700
then if you actually try to draw it

731
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,130
it'll randomly sort of decide whether

732
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,570
your thumb is a finger or not and and

733
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,830
the data will keep fluctuating it's

734
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,470
really really hard to use but my point

735
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,120
in sort of implementing this is that if

736
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,260
you can do that you can sort of do

737
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,770
anything so smarter Minds than mine can

738
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,360
in theory take this technology and and

739
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,680
make things that actually do make sense

740
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,350
like for example if you um if you're an

741
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,300
ad agency and you have a couple of

742
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,950
hundred people who use Photoshop every

743
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,640
day you probably also have some kind of

744
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,660
CMS where you stall your assets you

745
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,790
probably have some kind of workflow that

746
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,620
requires people to submit designs to

747
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,570
their boss and their boss to submit

748
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,360
those designs to a client and if you

749
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,360
have no js' built into the tools you

750
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,150
could in principle you could not only

751
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,120
say hook in you know no photoshop

752
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,070
directly into the CMS or the that offers

753
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,540
a some process or what do you everyone

754
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,850
do you could mean scrap that ID you

755
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,410
could run the CMS from inside Photoshop

756
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,520
if you wanted to because it's not you

757
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,320
can do anything you could make a sort of

758
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,180
get file you know you know decentralized

759
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,470
sort of process where everybody has

760
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,700
their own repository that lives inside

761
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,560
Photoshop and you could we I mean the

762
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,940
the possibilities are kind of endless

763
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,470
because it's node and you can anything

764
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,970
that there's all these thousands of

765
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,650
great libraries for node and you can now

766
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,820
call them all from Photoshop and you can

767
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,500
call Photoshop from them so I think it's

768
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,300
an example of taking two really deep

769
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,560
complex things and hooking them together

770
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,080
and hopefully you sort of multiply the

771
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,430
the possibilities of what comes out

772
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,720
that's essentially all my talk I've

773
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,160
smoked really fast and I have some time

774
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,130
left the source is online oh I should

775
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,420
have mentioned everything except

776
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,330
Photoshop that I showed is open source

777
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,150
and on github so the generator core the

778
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,590
app that loads in and runs the plugins

779
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,990
is open source the the built-in plugin

780
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,030
for publishing out the the image assets

781
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,250
that's also on github and it's all there

782
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,180
it's for people to extend and

783
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,150
and do something with my my source is

784
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,170
also up I wouldn't necessarily recommend

785
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,430
you go off it but there are some better

786
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,530
getting started sort of plugins if you

787
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:17,810
want to give it a try and I will there

788
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,340
was a bunch of links in here and so I

789
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,840
put the slides up a moment ago and I

790
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,570
will just tweet that so if anybody wants

791
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,550
to the slides that I just tweeted them

792
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,800
and they're up there somewhere and and

793
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,930
that's my Twitter and that's my talk so

794
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,550
and we have actually a bunch of time for

795
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,740
questions if anybody has any thank you
