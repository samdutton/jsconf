00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:10,410
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:21,420
My name is Carter.

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:34,310
Can you raise your hand if you ever organised
a conference, anything about developers together.

4
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,050
Cool!

5
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,860
Maybe 1/3-1/4 of the people here.

6
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,990
Fantastic.

7
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,980
The title is: A community of people not projects.

8
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,860
I have 2 modest goals.

9
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,450
For those who didn't raise your hand.

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,110
I hope this encourages you to get more involved
in the developer community where you live.

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,610
Or talk to people who do.

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,040
For those who raised your hand.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:13,850
I want to raise a few

14
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,540
things I learned.

15
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,990
My name is Carter.

16
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,600
I am a developer.

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,700
For send in receive text messages and voice
over Ip phone calls.

18
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,939
This is a photo of my shortly after I joined
the company.

19
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:42,670
People told me I have grown up a lot.

20
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,060
This is not me.

21
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,950
This is a photo of my daughter Catherine.

22
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,770
At JSConf US.

23
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:55,060
I was lucky to bring her down there.

24
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,380
Show her around and what her father thoes.

25
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,340
I have been married for 5 years.

26
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,630
We have 2 daughters.

27
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,539
Catherine and Emily on the bottom left.

28
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,829
The 4 of us live in Seattle Washington.

29
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:17,409
I'm from Washington DC.

30
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:19,440
I got a job at Microsoft.

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,450
I worked at it for a few years.

32
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,040
The last years at the Internet Explorer team.

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,370
The first cascade JS.

34
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,889
I founded it in 2012.

35
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:39,760
It is a conference for developers in the Northwest.

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,680
You might be asking yourself how I got in
organizing a conference.

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,250
In my case the answer is straightforward.

38
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,040
When I joined in 2012, I had never been a
developer.

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,329
I had a rough idea of what the job entailed.

40
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:05,859
It was explained a big component was going
to support the local developer community.

41
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:08,839
Frankly that seemed like an open ened thing.

42
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:11,209
It was terrifying.

43
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,449
But also very exciting.

44
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:19,200
I figured out for me what it meant to support
the Seattle developmer community.

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,989
I have been JS developer since the 90's.

46
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,209
Seattle JS is the largest meeting.

47
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,689
It has been around for a long time.

48
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:34,989
I just started going.

49
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:36,749
Getting to know the community.

50
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,829
Started helping out with the community.

51
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:44,139
During January-June I had the same conversation.

52
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:56,629
Everybody was frustrated that they got on
a plane and fly to Scottsdale or Berlin or

53
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:59,730
Emilia Island.

54
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,199
There was nothing in the Seattle area.

55
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,609
I totally agreed.

56
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:13,019
I talked to community organisers in Portland
and Vancouver BC.

57
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,479
We really wanted something for us.

58
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,669
That's where CascadiaJs came from.

59
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:24,629
It was inspired by JSConf.

60
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:25,699
Node Conf.

61
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:31,720
All of the conferences you think of being
the best of what it can be.

62
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,639
We put it on in November 2012.

63
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,440
It was a huge success.

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,340
We pulled together 200 amazing people for
2 days of fun.

65
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,620
It was one of the most rewarding experiences
I had.

66
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,979
The feedback was very very positive.

67
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:53,159
People liked a lot of different things.

68
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,229
The coffee, the food.

69
00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:01,909
But the reoccurrent theme was that people
were so delighted to meet other people.

70
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:04,409
Not just within the city they lived in.

71
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:11,830
People in Seattle were happy to meet interesting
people in Portland or Vancouver.

72
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,460
We had succeeded in connecting developers
in the Northwest.

73
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,810
I left.

74
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,810
And I was on this high cloud.

75
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,770
I don't know about you.

76
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,449
But I had a fever.

77
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,900
I had a fever.

78
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:35,020
The only prescription was going to be more
events, conferences, opportunities to create

79
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,330
experiences for my fellow developers.

80
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,939
I started to think ahead to 2013.

81
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:47,550
2013 was a really busy year.

82
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,300
I started in February.

83
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,020
I launched Sports Hac day.

84
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,590
A hackathon.

85
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,819
For sports related applications.

86
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:00,130
I'm a huge sports fan.

87
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,499
I don't know how many of you.

88
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:07,960
It is really great to connect with other people
in the area.

89
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,919
We helped this event during Super Bowl weekend.

90
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,710
2 days of hacking.

91
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,710
Had beer, pizza.

92
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:23,889
In April a community resource Seattle Hacks.com.

93
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:24,889
For developers.

94
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,189
It was powered.

95
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:37,719
You could give a request and participate in
this online event.

96
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:41,849
There was another Cascade JS.

97
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,310
This time in Vancouver BC.

98
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,169
A logistical challenge for me.

99
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,479
I live in Seattle, in America.

100
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:57,749
I had to think about organizing a conference
in another country.

101
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:04,320
I worked with organizers in Vancouver.

102
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,860
We had Vancouver Dev Week.

103
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,699
A series of great events for developers.

104
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:18,870
And to cap off a busy 2013, me and my friend
opened a co-working space for developers in

105
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,340
Seattle.

106
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,900
We wanted to take that people love.

107
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:31,969
We wanted to create a space where developers
could have that experience every day.

108
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:35,129
So, this was a really busy year.

109
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:38,129
I was very proud of everything I worked on.

110
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,569
I was feeling great.

111
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,909
I couldn't wait for 2014.

112
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:47,139
I thought 2013 kicked ass.

113
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:48,389
And I will show you.

114
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:52,389
What the first 4 months looked like.

115
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,999
Yeah...

116
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:58,610
Grumpy cat.

117
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,479
And this caught me off guard.

118
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,240
I thought, I figured everything out.

119
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,759
And I couldn't understand why I was having
such rough few months.

120
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,069
There was no follow-up to Sports hack day.

121
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,849
People were emailing.

122
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:18,749
When is Sports hack day?

123
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,819
The answer was, it wasn't going to happen.

124
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,729
Because I was too busy.

125
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:28,379
And I couldn't even imagine who else could
run it.

126
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,300
There wouldn't be another Sports hack day.

127
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,229
That was the first sign.

128
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,490
It wasn't just sports hack day.

129
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,909
I was dropping the ball a lot.

130
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,219
With the co-working space.

131
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,800
At work.

132
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,300
And this is very unlike me.

133
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,990
But at the time, in the middle of it, I really
didn't have a lot of insight why it was happening.

134
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,500
Things are tough and challenging.

135
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,399
Things came to a head in April.

136
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,760
I started working with Tracy Heins.

137
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,959
People in Portland know her.

138
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,410
She doesn't live there anymore.

139
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,709
She was one of the most active organisers.

140
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:19,870
I started working on the next Cascade Js.

141
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,220
By the time of April we weren't communicating
well.

142
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,670
She was frustrated with me.

143
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,780
And I was frustraged in general.

144
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,510
I couldn't understand well.

145
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:38,279
Things were going so easy in 2013 and poorly
in 2013.

146
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,690
I was flying home from a conference.

147
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,510
I wanted to read a book.

148
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:51,230
This is one of my favourite authors, Chuck
Klosterman.

149
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,310
He writes about music, sports.

150
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,160
For Spin Magazine.

151
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,940
He is great.

152
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,700
And I wanted my mind off of the stuff.

153
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,010
I read one of his books.

154
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,320
I'm on Amazon.

155
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,000
I found the book Killing yourself to live.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,300
The title is misleading.

157
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,020
About Chuck going on a roadtrip in the US.

158
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:22,870
There was a review where there was an excerpt
from the book.

159
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,480
I want to read it to you.

160
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,660
Art and love are the same thing.

161
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,610
The process of seeing yourself in things that
are not you.

162
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,260
I'm not kidding.

163
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:43,040
At that moment in that plane, this is what
happened to me.

164
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,779
And honestly, the people sittings next to
me thought I had a seizure.

165
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,930
Many don't get it in the audience.

166
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,570
Let's go back and revisit.

167
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,870
Let's look at art.

168
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:02,110
Let's say art is the process of seeing yourself
in things that aren't you.

169
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:10,110
If I'm an artist, writing a book, creating
a painting, maybe part of what is driving

170
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,860
me as an artist is to see myself manifested
in these objects that are not me.

171
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,350
Maybe that is a part of the creative process.

172
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,579
And that really resonated with me.

173
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:28,350
It resonated with me specifically in reference
to all the things I work on.

174
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,470
I started to think back to the first CascadiaJs.

175
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,620
What were the things I cared about?

176
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,009
Spent time doing?

177
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:43,070
What captured all of the energy an focus?

178
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,550
It was stuff like this.

179
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,210
For those who love coffee.

180
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,160
That is one of the finest ways you can enjoy
coffee.

181
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,110
I spent weeks looking for the best coffee
for CascadiaJs.

182
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,240
It didn't stop there.

183
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,389
What vendor to use for the hoodies.

184
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,050
And what food trucks for the lunch.

185
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,240
This was true for all the things I worked
on.

186
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,300
You might be thinking, so what?

187
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,410
Since when is it news that people work on
things that they are passionate about?

188
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,079
You are right.

189
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,790
This is not news.

190
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:30,440
But what was news to me was that I completely
focused on all those things and details.

191
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,519
I had completely just forgotten about all
the people that I worked with to make these

192
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,529
things happen.

193
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:44,790
Not a single thing that would have happened
without all of the people on the monitor,

194
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,680
plus many more people I couldn't list.

195
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,730
When I examined how thoughtful I was about
these people.

196
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:58,709
How much time I spent to get to know them.

197
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,300
What they were passionate about?

198
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,120
The answer was in many cases no.

199
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,029
I felt very ashamed when I realised this.

200
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:12,850
I thought I treated many people as a means
to an end.

201
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,870
It is very unlike me.

202
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:27,360
And so I absorbed this and decided, wow, that
will never ever happen again

203
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,662
And I put it into practice.

204
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:33,839
In August, the next CascadiaJs was going to
happen.

205
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,600
I really focused on the people running the
conference.

206
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,850
Tracy and Ben and Blane.

207
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,769
All these wonderful people.

208
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:51,310
I focused on what could I do to help them
to put on the best conference.

209
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:58,010
I think, because of that, I had the best experience
I had ever had as a CascadiaJs.

210
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:08,410
It was remarkably rewarding to see what Tracy
and her team could do and participate solely

211
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,209
for the purpose of removing obstacles from
their path.

212
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:22,000
Beyond being rewarding for me, it was also
the best CascadiaJs ever.

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,850
And I think that is the case, because I took
a step back and let someone else execute their

214
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,850
vision.

215
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,030
They took the conference to a place I didn't
know it could go.

216
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,449
It was rewarding to see it happen.

217
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:47,129
Following the conference, I really wanted
to sit down and think about everything that

218
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:48,129
had happened.

219
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:55,959
I also reached out to a bunch of people who
organize conferences and hackathons.

220
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,399
I talk to people like Chris Williams.

221
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,569
I'm very grateful for them taking the time
to talk to me.

222
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,069
I wanted to understand.

223
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:08,870
Is this just a me thing?

224
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,019
Or are other people running into similar issues?

225
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:14,160
Who are involved in the community.

226
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,139
There were a common issues that were pervasive.

227
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:26,779
So, whether you are thinking about getting
involved in the community.

228
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:28,980
I certainly hope that you do.

229
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,290
It is one of the most rewarding experiences
you can have.

230
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,720
Or you are neck deep in it.

231
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,560
I'd like to share a few things.

232
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,389
About being healthier and happier.

233
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,540
Number 1, you need to watch for signs that
you are doing to much.

234
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,819
I got a couple suggestions.

235
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:54,079
One, your work or family starts to suffer.

236
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,459
Every day you have so many hours.

237
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,730
And you have time with your family.

238
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,649
Time doing your job.

239
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:06,660
Maybe you have some time left over to work
on community obligation.

240
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:12,839
When that community stuff starts to creep
out it is necessarily going to impact your

241
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,060
family, work or both.

242
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,930
Keep your eye on how things are going at home
or at work.

243
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,260
You can't remember the last time you said
no.

244
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,980
I'm guilty of this.

245
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm terrible at saying no.

246
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,910
I'm trying to get better.

247
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,410
When people want help and reach out.

248
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,800
My instinct is to say: Yes, I will help you.

249
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,779
It makes me feel good.

250
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,759
You have to learn how to say now.

251
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,820
Saying no is not shutting someone down.

252
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,050
When someone asks for help, you are not the
person that can help them the most.

253
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,029
There is someone else who can help them much
more than you can.

254
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:01,230
If you are really involved in the community,
you have an idea who that might be.

255
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:09,260
If the requests come in, try to think of who
can help them more.

256
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,050
This is a giant red flag.

257
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,540
If you work on something that you care about.

258
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:20,130
You can't identify who can take it over, you
are doing too much.

259
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,400
You put what you care about at risk.

260
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,360
It is a huge red flag.

261
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:34,010
You are not sharing enough with the people
you are working with.

262
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,880
How do I identify and find awesome people?

263
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,460
I wish I can tell you I have a blueprint.

264
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,530
I don't.

265
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:48,190
But I have suggestions that are helpful for
me.

266
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,910
Really actively pay attention to the amazing
things that are going on around you.

267
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,620
It sounds obvious.

268
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,020
For me it wasn't.

269
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,390
I was heads down working on my stuff.

270
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,580
I had blinders on.

271
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:07,200
And you need to take the blinders off and
look around.

272
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,270
People are doing awesome things.

273
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,690
I met Tracy for the first meaningful time
when I went to Portland.

274
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,130
She was running Notebodsday.

275
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:29,330
It would never 
have happened.

276
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,720
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

277
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,280
A lot of people think this is a sign of failure.

278
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
It isn't.

279
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,070
Asking for help is nothing more than raising
your hand and saying, I'm passionate about

280
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,070
something.

281
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,350
I'd love to work with someone on this.

282
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,910
Two things to keep in mind.

283
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,920
Be explicit.

284
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,850
Just need help with your meet up is not helpful.

285
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,970
That you want to record the talks, and post
them online, is helpful.

286
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,780
You need to be public.

287
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,500
Don't talk just to a few people.

288
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,300
Put it out there.

289
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,710
The truth is, you might not know a videographer.

290
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,120
There might not be one connected directly
to you.

291
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:25,240
If you put it out publically, you discover
people you didn't know and want to help you.

292
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Lastly.

293
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,690
I'm still working on this.

294
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,570
Take the time to get to know people.

295
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,080
To get to know these people as people.

296
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,880
Understand what they care about, what they
are passionate about.

297
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,170
If I had done a better job, I would not have
treated people as a means to an end.

298
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,170
But I didn't.

299
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,190
I didn't prioritize that.

300
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,320
That is a huge mistake.

301
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,590
This is the third thing.

302
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,560
The crux of my talk.

303
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:09,680
Stop talking like I'm working on a project
and start thinking like you are working with

304
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,810
people.

305
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,220
I'm starting to do this for the next CascadiaJs.

306
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,700
I'm less focused where it is going to be,
where it is going to be.

307
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,860
But more focused on, who am I going to work
with?

308
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,070
The details will come later.

309
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,150
You need to do a few things.

310
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,640
You need to learn how to let go.

311
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,540
No one here has a kid under 6?

312
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,970
You know who that is.

313
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,820
And why this is funny or annoying.

314
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,210
You have to know how to let go.

315
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:53,750
If you can't figure out how to let go of these
precious little things that you have created,

316
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,820
you'll never succeed in sharing them with
people.

317
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:03,580
Number 2, you need to get serious about documentation
and communication.

318
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,880
And I don't care what tools you use.

319
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,240
Tracy uses GetHub and Irc.

320
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,280
The tools don't matter.

321
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,740
You have to get everything out of your head
and into a place where you can work asynchronously

322
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,410
with people.

323
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,910
This is incredibly important in terms of sharing.

324
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,190
This is really funny.

325
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,640
I work for a platform company.

326
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,120
Tulio is uninteresting in a vacuum.

327
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,740
No one cares.

328
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:45,550
What is cool is what developers build on top
of the platform.

329
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,460
Other people will agree with that at platform
companies.

330
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,210
I had to relearn that in the context of community.

331
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:02,740
It wasn't about what I did, by myself, like
it was what I could help other people do.

332
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,580
I had to redefine what success looked like
for me.

333
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:15,010
And I'm glad I did because honestly, my involvement
in the developer community has been providing

334
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,720
me with some of the rewarding experiences
in my life.

335
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,270
I'm grateful I ended up in this place.

336
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,880
If you think about getting involved.

337
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,390
Or if you are very involved.

338
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,300
Remember these 3 things.

339
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,990
One, don't try to do everything yourself.

340
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,940
Two, find people who share your passion.

341
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,930
Three, focus on what you can help them accomplish.

342
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:47,640
Lastly, for anyone who might consider this
for a living.

343
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,790
Come find me in the hallway track.

344
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,300
I'd like to talk about Twilio.

345
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,330
That's it about me.
