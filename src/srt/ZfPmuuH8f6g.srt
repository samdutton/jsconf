1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310

um and before I really get started I

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,600
need to do this poll otherwise because I

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,649
don't know how to continue so let me get

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:08,790
my camera out because this is going to

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,870
be important I just need to document

6
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,469
this so how many of you guys want me to

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:20,369
call this a jiff and let's see a show of

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,109
hands for fuel to want me to call it a

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:37,530
gift cool so thank you for that I'm

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,700
going to try to remember not to

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,050
pronounce it the other way which I'd

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,719
never totally never do so hi I'm Pavel

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,219
um at Mac and I on Twitter I'm here

14
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,829
repping Vegas gs-r las vegas-based

15
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,140
javascript meetup group and here on

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,190
behalf of zappos com where I do backend

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,230
mobile API development in Java so when I

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,579
get home I'll be sure to tell them i

19
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,300
really enjoyed the java fest right right

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,640
i'm here with some buddies of mine dan

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,220
and Dashon dan is speaking later and you

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,799
might have heard dave speak at happy

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,840
JSON like versioning api's with happy if

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,470
you're in Vegas do stop by or look me up

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,520
and I'm not going to make any

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,820
presumptions that anybody here is a web

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,229
developer because javascript is

28
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,060
everywhere now right and I'm definitely

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,530
not going to make any assumptions that

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,000
you guys were web developers way back

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,520
when this was a thing because you all

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,689
look so useful it's not creepy right so

33
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,780
just in summary the the one by one pixel

34
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,500
gift is taking so nowadays we do

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,200
positioning on web pages with CSS it's

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,970
very powerful it's easy to move things

37
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,549
around and specify margins and padding

38
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,369
and XYZ position that maybe not z

39
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:54,600
positions well maybe in dance

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,460
presentation you can do Z positions but

41
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,829
XY positions on the page and it's really

42
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,320
nice but the back when the one by one

43
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,600
pixel gif workaround was created there

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,610
was no such thing you basically had page

45
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,129
full options of like down to the right

46
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,770
everything was down into the right so

47
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,360
the way to get around this was to take a

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,650
1 by

49
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,930
one pixel gif and just stretch it out

50
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,329
use that as a positioning and my monitor

51
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:22,769
hates this thing okay cool and so this

52
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:24,090
is what that looks like that's actually

53
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,579
a gift that's stretched out to whatever

54
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,959
like is it still a pixel if it's

55
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:28,950
stretched out because it's no longer

56
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,329
like one pixel it's like a whole

57
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,760
nevermind this is basically what the

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:41,459
code looked like so it worked it works

59
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,200
surprisingly well except for the fact

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,379
that then you had like all this this

61
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,879
extra these extra images in your code

62
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,739
and that violates something called like

63
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,400
the Semantic Web the guy who invented

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,349
the interwebs kind of likes that stuff

65
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:59,189
and and and what it is it's um it's that

66
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,040
you want want the the content of the

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,450
webpage take priority over the

68
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,569
presentation so it can be referenced

69
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,519
easily and used easily in parts by

70
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,209
machines and it's more usable and a an

71
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,639
image that's invisible has no semantic

72
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,349
meaning so it kind of made Tim

73
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,160
berners-lee cry a little bit does

74
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,889
anybody know who this guy is No so this

75
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,069
man is named Dave Segal andresito

76
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,790
seagull seagull so yeah no not different

77
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,909
guy a different guy and so if like Tim

78
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:38,549
berners-lee and Eric Myers are like the

79
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,949
patron saints of like semantic web and

80
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,010
like like I don't know like good web

81
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,930
design with standards this guy's more of

82
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,909
like a satanic priest with with goat

83
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:50,159
leggings it kind of like hops around and

84
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,720
pokes young web developers the

85
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,010
smoldering sticks to get them to do

86
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,069
stuff you can't really blame them so he

87
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,780
wrote this book called creating killer

88
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,389
websites as anybody has anybody read

89
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:03,750
this so this is this is written back in

90
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,470
1996 and it had actually so Dave Segal

91
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,049
invented 1 x 1 pixel gif trick according

92
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:13,019
to him and and so it was it was broke

93
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,919
into the world in this book so it's kind

94
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,680
of like one of those things but it's not

95
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,150
just that it wasn't just like this one

96
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,830
little trick to make your web you know

97
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,750
do this book is like packed with work

98
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,789
grounds of that sort with all kinds of

99
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:27,210
like

100
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,330
little insidious like hacks and like

101
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,550
using invisible tables for layout and

102
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,789
stuff like that you can't really blame

103
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,259
them though because you know at this

104
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,539
time he might have been actually the

105
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:41,460
first person ever to think about this as

106
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,500
the point of view of like a web designer

107
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,560
instead of a web developer and again

108
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
like down to the right is not very

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,830
flexible for somebody who came at it

110
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,190
from print design he had a lot of

111
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,270
interesting quotes I'm going to read

112
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,530
this to you because it's long and I know

113
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,020
like attention spans but this is one of

114
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,669
his quotes if you want machines to read

115
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:00,810
your web pages use things like

116
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,610
definition lists unordered list headers

117
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,830
etc if you want people to read them

118
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,750
don't do it they take away your

119
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,000
typographical control specify your own

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,830
font sizes when you want to size change

121
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,660
if you must use bullets make your own

122
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,039
bullets I don't see much point in

123
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,410
bullets if your vertical grouping is

124
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,780
good and try not to ever number your

125
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,070
list items it's hardly ever necessary so

126
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,780
he had some crazy ideas and you have

127
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,610
probably made Tim berners-lee cry a

128
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,210
little bit but again he was from print

129
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,419
design and he was just not I mean he

130
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:34,650
just wanted his web pages look good he

131
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,500
was not apologetic for it all I'm gonna

132
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,580
take you through a few of the tricks

133
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,820
that uh that I used back then and then

134
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,710
we're kind of popular like so I I was a

135
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,270
web developer back then and I've used

136
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,699
like probably all of these and done

137
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,909
worse things for a while I hosted one by

138
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:53,699
one gif net because i used the you know

139
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,789
the single pixel images so much there's

140
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,990
pretty bad web designer back that I'm

141
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,400
still pretty bad web designer but now

142
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,180
use CSS so that's cool so one of the

143
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,289
ways you can use these to indenture

144
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,169
paragraphs you just take like a short

145
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,930
and long gift it's invisible you put it

146
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,669
in front of your your paragraph it works

147
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:12,870
fine there was no other way of doing

148
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,699
this at the time you could add extra

149
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,020
spaces but then the white space was

150
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,479
cancelled out so this is kind of the way

151
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,740
it worked well except for the fact you

152
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,000
had to put it in front of every

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,759
paragraph and now you can just do that

154
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,919
with like text indent with CSS it's

155
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,449
beautiful you can do eam dashes you just

156
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,550
make it a visible gift and you stick it

157
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,990
in there now there's no that you could

158
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,690
do like to text ashes there were no

159
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,940
there wasn't a good way of doing this

160
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,500
and you could type

161
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,670
the good there's no space between

162
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,710
letters it's supposed to be it's like

163
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,970
how it's supposed to be from a

164
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,370
typographer standpoint it just wreaks

165
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,560
havoc on like copy paste and it's it's

166
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,560
weird now we have htmlentities you can

167
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,970
just drop in and and it works great

168
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,710
wasn't there back then you can control

169
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,600
line spacing so same thing as the

170
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,920
paragraph indent just you know vertical

171
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,440
and I should at this time point out that

172
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,540
the the V space and via line we have

173
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,950
there they don't work anymore not in

174
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,290
html5 but they would basically just add

175
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,680
spaces on the sides of them you can fake

176
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,060
it with width and height by the way

177
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,730
which is how I got this to render at all

178
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,080
so this works great there's another way

179
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,280
of doing this you could maybe at most

180
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,060
like double space your lines and stuff

181
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,470
but this gave you precise control of

182
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,200
your line spacing now you just use line

183
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,840
spacing it works really well this is

184
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,480
more of the other things were kind of

185
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,530
forgivable there's another way of doing

186
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,660
this is kind of like a what are you even

187
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,190
doing so he this is this is an actual

188
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,360
Dave example he made a decorative like

189
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,070
horizontal rule by using transparent

190
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,340
purple transparent sorry transparent

191
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,770
gifts and purple gifts and made this

192
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,560
weird thing that that um I don't even

193
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,030
know like you just constructed an image

194
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,919
using HTML there's no excuse for this it

195
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,979
was just like we had the technology is

196
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,900
just like just an image right and

197
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,150
probably the amount of space that that

198
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,440
one gift would take up even like a

199
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,350
really long one is less than all of this

200
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,460
markup it's horrible the other use

201
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,040
that's pretty common the mighty familiar

202
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,169
with our web bugs really call them were

203
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,120
creepy pixels for kind of tracking your

204
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,220
visitors this one this is kind of an

205
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,750
aside this one you might be familiar

206
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,640
with this is what google analytics sends

207
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,169
down like to track your visitors and but

208
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,510
considering that Google sends out like I

209
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,219
don't know really large numbers of these

210
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,380
per day you might think they want to

211
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,969
compress it down as much as possible and

212
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,720
that's pretty true so a few years ago

213
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,120
somebody over at probably programming

214
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,530
whose name is not mentioned at all on

215
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,820
the site so i can't really give credit

216
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,529
kind of looked into this

217
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,100
and looked up the the formula of a gif

218
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,569
image and tried to find out what the

219
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:00,449
smallest possible gift was and it turns

220
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,249
out like if you include all the

221
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:05,279
necessary things it's 43 bites the one

222
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,579
that Google sends out is 35 and it's a

223
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:11,850
it's a white pixel that's because they

224
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,680
excluded the the graphics control

225
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,689
extensions which make it transparent so

226
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,829
I like I don't know if this is true at

227
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:18,209
all but I like to think that there's

228
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,829
somebody at Google who's looked at the

229
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:22,470
numbers and was like you to extra bytes

230
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,120
like I would like to have a transparent

231
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,889
image but the savings of two bites are

232
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,829
just going to be too awesome and I don't

233
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,059
know if how that's working out for them

234
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:32,399
but that was there how am i doing on

235
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,059
time my good okay I just want to look at

236
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:38,009
maybe like one other horrible horrible

237
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,540
hack at me it's not that horrible

238
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,759
actually I use this one lock which is

239
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,610
rounded corners there was no good way of

240
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,360
doing this in like 97 so what we do is

241
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,970
we take these images in Photoshop and

242
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,180
give them a transfer sorry a white

243
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,750
background no sorry a white foreground

244
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,879
the upper left is white and the bottom

245
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,980
right is transparent and that way if you

246
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,269
put it up in the corner of one of your

247
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,740
tables you could change the color of the

248
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,540
table and the whole thing would change

249
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,819
is grounded and it worked pretty well I

250
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:11,309
think like as far as horrible markup

251
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:12,720
it's not that bad it's just like one

252
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,449
table but still not semantics not an

253
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,230
ideal solution and then script oculus

254
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,100
came out anybody anybody member script

255
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,470
tactless we have any fans yeah so I

256
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,569
think it's the best thing ever the

257
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:29,220
website kind of looks like it doesn't

258
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,480
look that much more modern than that

259
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,800
very first web site we were looking at

260
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,509
where this stuff was like centered in

261
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,120
the circles I think we were going

262
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,800
through some sort of like all right fine

263
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,509
we realize the images are bad and we're

264
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,189
going to trust anything except for a

265
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:43,470
bunch of images so script oculus made it

266
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,139
so that you could like have your markup

267
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,240
be clean but then there'd be some

268
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,649
JavaScript that would make your corners

269
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,529
magically round okay cool that's awesome

270
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,120
it's perfectly clean but the way it did

271
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,829
it was by inserting like stacks and

272
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,079
stacks of tiny tiny divs that's me

273
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,449
moving my mouse cursor up and down

274
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,819
across the the debugger fool so just

275
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:04,649
like so many divs for just these stupid

276
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:05,620
rounded corners

277
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,380
and it's like it's almost worse in a way

278
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,210
I think than just sticking an image in

279
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,760
there like you understand images were

280
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,320
bad and it's kind of like it definitely

281
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,790
a step in a different direction but

282
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,160
maybe not the the right one I don't know

283
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,750
and so like am I allowed to have like a

284
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,779
like a like a lesson or like something

285
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,910
are these supposed to be complete so if

286
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,320
there's a lesson to all of this I want

287
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,200
it to be this so if you make things kind

288
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,710
of hard for people for things hard for

289
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,330
people to do what they want they're

290
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,180
going to find ways of working around it

291
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,740
and so I mean that's good i'm not going

292
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,000
to discourage hacks hacks are like a

293
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,550
very proud tradition of computer land

294
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,330
people like we all love tax and stuff

295
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,380
but the thing is like you know if you

296
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,310
find a hack and then you you know use it

297
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,529
and it becomes like pretty convenient it

298
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,330
catches on other people use it maybe you

299
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,730
like right a kind of opportunity to book

300
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,070
about it and it gets out there and soon

301
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,589
like the hack becomes commonplace it's

302
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:09,850
going to kind of hurt the internet maybe

303
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,520
like or hurt javascript or something so

304
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,560
like do your hacks but i kind of want

305
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,089
you to be like a little bit little bit

306
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:17,410
thoughtful of them and so while you're

307
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,940
doing the hack think about like how

308
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,709
would i do this if the world is perfect

309
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:25,209
it was an ideal world because there are

310
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:28,060
longer-term solutions and like you can

311
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,959
take your your ideas and and just sort

312
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,390
of share them out there are this is the

313
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,130
extensible web manifesto if you guys are

314
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,770
read it so so like the people who write

315
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,240
browsers and rendering engines they

316
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
don't just like write them they work off

317
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,870
of standards and there's people to

318
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,570
contribute to these standards and like

319
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,209
those people could be you like you could

320
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,440
you read the manifesto it's really

321
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
inspiring and and like maybe read some

322
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,390
draft specifications look at them give

323
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,700
your commentary sign up to some mailing

324
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,230
lists you might like it you might make

325
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,600
like the future less painful for for

326
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,830
future you so that's all I got

327
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,890
I'm not going to mess with Futterman how
