1
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,800

hello

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,320
yes my name is Backlund I nice to see

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,240
you here I have to admit when I said yes

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,460
to give his talk I didn't realize how

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,320
large so this conference would be but I

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,050
think it will be fine so ya feeling like

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,239
a fake yeah maybe yeah maybe first about

8
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,809
my background I'm a web developer and I

9
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,730
work for an Icelandic company called

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,510
colibri and we work and team up with

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,010
other companies to build digital

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,770
products websites and apps but i only

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,989
started there two months ago and before

14
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,210
that i have been an Android developer

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,670
for five years and so yeah I'm decided

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,500
not to talk about my two months

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,300
experience of JavaScript but I'm going

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,119
to talk about the imposter syndrome and

19
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,430
this talk is just more about feelings

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,039
and thoughts and the emotions which is

21
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,440
normally maybe not talked much about the

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,210
attack on for this but it was also

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,160
likely empathy talk yesterday which I

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,560
thought was great and miles they are

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,600
mentioned a impostor syndrome if you

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,360
noticed and so I'm going to tie into

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,140
this and the impostor syndrome is a term

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,380
that was coined up in the seventies by

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,090
two psychologists that we're doing

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,570
research on high-achieving women and it

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,229
refers to when a person feels like like

32
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,290
an imposter like a fake or a fraud in

33
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,880
their field and it's always afraid

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,650
though that everybody else is just going

35
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,479
to find out that they are not competent

36
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,740
and this is in spite of science external

37
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,439
signs of success like and they are just

38
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,340
dismissed as timing or luck or something

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,009
like that so I wanted to like ask you

40
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,750
here you know how many of you are

41
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,940
familiar with this feeling mice exactly

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,540
and yeah you are not alone that's normal

43
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,100
some study showed that sanity percent of

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,769
all people have like experience this at

45
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,790
some point in their time and two or five

46
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,160
successful people you know feel like

47
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,860
fake

48
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,660
most of the time and you will be glad to

49
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,840
hear this is really common with

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,340
successful and like high achieving

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,890
people and it's not gender exclusive but

52
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,080
it is more common with women and

53
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,320
specially learning like male-dominated

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,930
fields but you're also in a group with

55
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,560
people like Neil Gaiman Tina Fey Bill

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,570
Murray and Emma Watson we're all

57
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,910
expressed that they have experienced

58
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,250
important syndrome so that's not a bad

59
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,470
great to be a part of I'm come start out

60
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,830
just be telling you my story and then

61
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,890
later on I have some advices that have

62
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:21,910
helped me to overcome it and yeah i mean

63
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,120
i am a female in a male dominant

64
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,430
industry and i think like my intricate

65
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,030
this might have looked wrong from that i

66
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,410
studied computer science in the

67
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,630
university hun iceland and when i

68
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,420
started to study it I didn't really know

69
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,370
programming I don't like I'll just a

70
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,120
little bit in HTML and I accidentally

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,660
took one course in SQL in college but i

72
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,690
really liked math and computers so you

73
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,080
know i decided to try it out and and i

74
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,200
remember at the first like social events

75
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,690
in the school some guy came up to me and

76
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,820
asked me what what computer games do you

77
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,489
play and I was like oh my god I'm

78
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,840
never going to be a good programmer

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,019
because I don't play any computer games

80
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,269
but then I realized that you don't have

81
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,560
to play computer games to be a

82
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,959
programmer and you definitely are not

83
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,910
necessarily good program or even though

84
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,709
you play computer games it was a relief

85
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:23,020
and another thing I noticed when I was

86
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,010
in in the university that like it's

87
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,900
difference between guys and girls

88
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,090
because like I was one of very few girls

89
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,130
in my studies were just like I don't

90
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,320
know to Rihanna's baby and and I I

91
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,960
really have this urge to talk about my

92
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,300
feelings with

93
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,800
my girlfriends and I do that like all

94
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,300
the time and if I'm just rush to stuff

95
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,090
like that but the guys really don't do

96
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,620
that and it was so often like like I was

97
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,690
like a total stress and freaking out

98
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,940
because I didn't understand anything but

99
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,800
it was afraid to tell it tell it to the

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,599
guys because like they never expressed

101
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:03,990
it but then like I always like found out

102
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,150
later on that the most of them were just

103
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,800
as stressed as me and didn't like to

104
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,289
understand everything and some stuff

105
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:13,740
like that so you know I encourage you

106
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,659
guys if you feel like that system I talk

107
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:17,580
about your emotions and your feelings I

108
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,690
think it's definitely better and it's

109
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,240
normal I mean I can understand that he

110
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,340
feels like an imposter when you are

111
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,719
studying and I mean and it's common with

112
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,060
students to feel feel the imposter

113
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,500
syndrome because like you don't know

114
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,819
everything and you're constantly

115
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,270
learning and like I just had this

116
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,610
nagging fear that I was not good enough

117
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,590
programmer and expected it would just

118
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,550
you know go away after I graduated but

119
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,060
then it kind of didn't and I studied

120
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,639
Android programming the first time it

121
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,400
was taught here in Iceland 2009 to 10

122
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,219
and then i graduated in 2010 and i

123
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:02,639
started to work on Android and PHP if

124
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,789
you remember left programming limits but

125
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:07,409
mostly enter it and you know date

126
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,300
another android program on the sides and

127
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,779
then in 2012 i was approached by an

128
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,750
icelandic startup called plain vanilla

129
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,830
which does the trivia app called quiz 0

130
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,990
which is like i would have to say the

131
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,690
past trivia in the world and has gained

132
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,150
like worldwide success and they

133
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,219
approached me because like i was the

134
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:31,349
most experienced the most experienced

135
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,500
android programmers in Iceland which

136
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,389
might sound cool but i thought it was

137
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:38,310
terrifying because i did not feeling

138
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,310
like I was left experienced but I

139
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,889
accepted the job of course it was really

140
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:46,379
exciting and we were just six at a time

141
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,960
and the company grew up to 80 people in

142
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,080
two years and yeah games like really

143
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,320
worldwide huge success

144
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,810
and even after a couple of years and I

145
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,810
was a part of this whole process really

146
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,690
deep into the development and and

147
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,130
everything I you know I still was always

148
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,840
afraid that you know someday they would

149
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,370
find out that I did not know what I was

150
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,620
doing and somehow I always assumed that

151
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,410
everybody else knew what they were doing

152
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:21,240
which is maybe not correct so about two

153
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,200
years ago I had had a massive burnet at

154
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,450
my work and started to you know some

155
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,760
soul-searching I guess you can say and

156
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,330
then I came across his term the impostor

157
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,640
syndrome and there's in a reading it

158
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,920
black and white you know exactly the

159
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,510
same feelings that I had been

160
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,540
experiencing that that was just a huge

161
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,840
of the first big step in getting like

162
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,840
overcoming it realizing it was not just

163
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,510
you know me being like an insecure woman

164
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,820
but this was just like a Sherman can

165
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,440
happen to our and anyone so yeah that

166
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,300
was great but like van in the past two

167
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,780
years I've done some things I feel that

168
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,120
have helped me overcome the imposter

169
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,190
syndrome and I wanted to share those

170
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:13,890
advices with you yes how how to overcome

171
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:20,430
it first recognize your success if you

172
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,850
just you know sit down and write down

173
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,970
how how you came to the place you are

174
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,860
today like what decision did you make

175
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,960
like when did it say yes when it could I

176
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
said no and you know what problems have

177
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,510
you solved then projects you have done

178
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,580
and know what new things have you

179
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,890
learned and like I'll promise you you'll

180
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,320
realize that you have a big part in your

181
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,700
success and then recognize your

182
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,980
strengths and weaknesses and like Miles

183
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,750
said yesterday I mean we are you know

184
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,690
human and we are all the same but we

185
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,400
still have like a different you know

186
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,320
your strengths and weaknesses and and

187
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,410
that's fine I mean some people are

188
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,940
introverts while others are outspoken

189
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,880
and I

190
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,680
is better than the other they're just

191
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,500
you know both just you know a human

192
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,460
elements and and I don't know about you

193
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,590
but I sometimes tend to compare myself

194
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,420
with other people that have there's

195
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,610
different qualities then I am or to like

196
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,220
you know people that really excel in

197
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,680
what they're doing but unrealistic

198
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,170
comparison doesn't really doesn't really

199
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,800
help so if we would just focus on your

200
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,510
strengths and if you can approve on them

201
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,910
and then we also you know think about

202
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,680
your weaknesses and you know maybe

203
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,640
that's something you can overcome like

204
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,730
for me it took me a really long time to

205
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,000
accept that being a single mom as I am I

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,190
just don't have the same time and energy

207
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,170
as people that on the children to spent

208
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,930
in programming and work and all that and

209
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,600
that probably means that I won't gain as

210
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,030
much knowledge sent you know experience

211
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,550
as those folks and that's just fine I

212
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,340
have finally accepted that and I have

213
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,680
you know different qualities I think

214
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,130
fairly decent that giving talks and you

215
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,720
know I'm good to work with people and

216
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,130
you know that might be something that

217
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,000
other people lack and and another

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,210
weakness of mine i have i have found out

219
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,420
is that I I don't ask for help soon

220
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,390
enough so I like tentacle and just get

221
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,030
stuck in a deep rabbit hole which makes

222
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,370
me really frustrated and before I

223
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,860
finally asked for help with this of

224
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,960
course not good for anybody but i've

225
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,520
been i've been working right another

226
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,370
thing is pair programming when i was

227
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,650
first as the pair program I was

228
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,560
terrified I mean when you feel like a

229
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,510
fake how are you going to fake that when

230
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,160
another person is just watching watching

231
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,900
over your shoulder when you're

232
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,550
programming but then it turns out you

233
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,340
know I did much better than I thought I

234
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,270
would I mean still today I get a little

235
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,220
like stage fright when I'm asked to

236
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,640
program and like being a driver seat and

237
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,720
when I mean I think it's just practice

238
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,800
and

239
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,769
and getting the experience to pair

240
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,839
program with another person and see like

241
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,810
how they solve problems and go round I

242
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,330
mean that's really valuable and you will

243
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,040
definitely see that other people don't

244
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,510
know what they're doing all the time

245
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,149
either you know so that's really

246
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,800
valuable and I'm not saying to pair

247
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,720
program all the time I definitely think

248
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
there's a time and a place for it but

249
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,190
definitely do it you know every once in

250
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,630
a while that's really healthy I'm

251
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,920
getting feedback from somebody you trust

252
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,260
somebody that works with you and you

253
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,380
know do it in a formal setting I tend to

254
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,060
when people like compliments meters on a

255
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,399
casual basis you know I tend to just you

256
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,500
know not really registering it or just

257
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,209
saying like either just saying it or

258
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:04,060
something like that but having a like

259
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,430
formal feedback I have both done this at

260
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,290
plain vanilla where I used to work and

261
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,200
we also do it at colibri we're just both

262
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,300
persons you know come prepare to talk

263
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,579
about your weaknesses and strengths and

264
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:18,310
you know giving constructive feedback

265
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,550
and I at least discovered that i have

266
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,260
some qualities that i didn't realize i

267
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,970
had and you know that's really good to

268
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,220
hear from a person you trust and it

269
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,079
doesn't have to be your boss or anything

270
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,500
just you know a co-worker you or use the

271
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:40,029
work with and then ask for house it said

272
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,399
that the worst thing that can happen if

273
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,470
you ask for half this that's all buddy

274
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,990
says no and I mean of course that can

275
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,180
suck and you have to be prepared for

276
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,850
that but I feel like the worst thing

277
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,310
that happens when I asked for have it's

278
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,079
not necessarily together no but then I'm

279
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,089
just you know exposing that I don't know

280
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,760
something and but that's there something

281
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,180
you like have to overcome and you know

282
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,360
just realize that it's not senior to not

283
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,390
ask for half because you know you never

284
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,220
learn anything if you would never ask

285
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,190
anything and in the end it's not even

286
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,949
just about you it's about you know other

287
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,019
people as well and it's better for

288
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:21,730
everybody you know if you work in a team

289
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,020
with it just admit that it does know

290
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,420
something and you would get help instead

291
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,030
of you know banging your

292
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,080
had to a stone or something and related

293
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,560
to that is be vulnerable by that I mean

294
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,440
just you know don't be afraid to express

295
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,090
your thoughts and feelings they're

296
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,490
definitely as valid as everybody else's

297
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,330
and you know it don't have to be afraid

298
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,140
to be wrong everybody is wrong everyone

299
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,480
to my wife I mean precedence or wrong

300
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,160
all the time it's okay for you to be

301
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,090
wrong and even if you like sometimes

302
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,610
feel stupid if you say something that

303
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,410
does not mean that you were stupid and

304
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,950
everybody has that's every yeah every

305
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,230
now and then yeah we are just human and

306
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:20,010
humans are not perfect I gave gave his

307
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,500
talk as well at the dais meet up here in

308
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,080
Iceland a couple of weeks ago and I got

309
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,490
a lot of really good feedback format and

310
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,520
some of the feedback I got made me add

311
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,080
this slide into it was that like I'm

312
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,790
talking about you know showing respect

313
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,880
and no being vulnerable asking for half

314
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,890
and that kind of depends on that you

315
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,590
like trust your teammates and your

316
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,290
company and yeah it's been said to me

317
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,660
like that not all workplaces or like

318
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,240
that you know in some workplaces below

319
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,970
it's like frowned upon to show any

320
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,370
weakness of asking cash for something

321
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,020
you know and some people said it was

322
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,120
coming in ad agencies i don't know i

323
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,160
just heard that and but first of all if

324
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,750
you work in a workplace like that i

325
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,040
would just tell you to get the hell out

326
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,870
of there and go work somewhere where you

327
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,680
have feel good and but another thing

328
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,860
also i feel like actually having that

329
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,270
would you say yeah having that in the

330
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,550
workplace gives you like tools and

331
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,540
platforms to you know you're expected to

332
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,760
say that if you don't know something or

333
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,200
if you need help like in our daily

334
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,260
meetings you know you should say if if

335
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,060
you need help to something and you know

336
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,730
doing rattles going over what went wrong

337
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,790
and what you can do to improve on it so

338
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,520
i definitely think that's a good place

339
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,210
to start if you don't have it as well

340
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,520
and then like at cooley bri we have

341
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,090
taken it a bit further and i don't know

342
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,880
if you heard about Jim McCarthy's 11

343
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,310
protocols core protocols has anybody

344
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,000
heard about it okay okay is it

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,890
definitely google it i wasn't sure like

346
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,320
if people knew about it or not but Tim

347
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,720
McCarthy worked for Microsoft for many

348
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,010
many years and he was just really good

349
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,020
at you know building teams and he'll

350
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,670
expect that in two or three years just

351
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,490
researching how how was the best way to

352
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,010
work at a team and being good teammate

353
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,120
and you know so it seemed basically

354
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,880
works for the minimal amount of time but

355
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,540
maximum amount of output and that really

356
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,360
depends on that people feel they can be

357
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,250
himself and feel good working in a team

358
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,130
so he has like these 11 protocols I'm

359
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,200
not going to go through them all one of

360
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,990
them is you know ask for help one I

361
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,730
wanted to you know explain is check-ins

362
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,790
this is a thing you do either at the

363
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,270
start of a meeting or on a regular basis

364
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,250
like it Coldplay we do this just every

365
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,980
friday and then also in some meetings

366
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,940
and then you go the circle so everybody

367
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,030
shares their feelings and we have these

368
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,480
four feelings you you you go by that's

369
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,360
you know if you're mad glad sad or

370
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,140
afraid of something and it can't be you

371
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,640
know or something related to work or

372
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,150
just something personal at first you

373
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,250
kind of made me feel it's weird but you

374
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,350
know I actually start used to it really

375
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,640
fast and I love LA two minutes now and

376
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,830
it's just you know exposes that you know

377
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,160
maybe a co-worker you know has a sick

378
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,380
family member and that's why he has been

379
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,180
feeling you know Pat the whole week and

380
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,830
you realize oh man okay it's not because

381
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,660
he doesn't like me but it's because of

382
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,850
that I mean it's just one example and I

383
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,920
just definitely think

384
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,700
this builds you know trust in within a

385
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,250
team so yeah really recommend to advance

386
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,680
so are there any positives about the

387
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,090
imposter syndrome I mean yes there are

388
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,940
if you have it you you're very likely to

389
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,640
be successful you're likely to be a hard

390
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,060
worker you're probably like a

391
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,080
perfectionist so I mean it there are

392
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,060
positives there but if you don't like

393
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,520
what's out it can end in you know

394
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,730
undesirable stress and burnout and so I

395
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,270
don't think it's a desirable state to be

396
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,720
in in the long run but I mean you can

397
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,880
take some positives out of it definitely

398
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,590
yeah so does this connect to Josh gift

399
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:51,040
at all you might ask for me it does

400
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,140
going from like a senior android

401
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,060
position i was at plain vanilla and

402
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,160
going to like a junior front-end web

403
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,040
developer at colibri was it took a lot

404
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,710
of courage and i don't think i would

405
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,110
have done it if I still suffered

406
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,670
severely from the apartment syndrome

407
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,220
because I knew it would mean that I

408
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,290
would have to be totally honest about my

409
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,800
childhood skills wits or not that good

410
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,950
and I would have to be not afraid to ask

411
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,040
questions and yeah to just you know

412
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,510
being honest sand but you know yeah

413
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,290
having that Kurtz now it's the reason

414
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,000
why I'm here at the account today so

415
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,630
there is this josh with connection and I

416
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,510
mean and then I don't know if you can

417
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,010
completely overcame it I don't know I

418
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,370
don't feel I definitely have just you

419
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,910
know on wednesday i went to the reactor

420
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,280
workshop with brian hall which was by

421
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,590
the way really good and in the morning

422
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,890
he had like some examples we did and

423
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,540
then we had to do some exercise I'm i

424
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:02,870
started

425
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,940
so it looked really simple and I

426
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,830
couldn't get it to build and was like oh

427
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,360
my god there's always people there they

428
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,520
can see what I'm doing and you know my

429
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,020
brain just goes into oh my god I'm so

430
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,970
silly I'm so stupid i can do this and

431
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,809
you know it's totally not logical i know

432
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:19,580
that but you know sometimes you can't

433
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,160
control your brain but it just takes you

434
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,470
know a couple of minutes today for me to

435
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,500
get out of this state and realize you

436
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,510
know I'm just new at javascript it's

437
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,340
okay even if i don't know the syntax

438
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,070
completely and in the next exercise I

439
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,770
know I I know this now and I just asked

440
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,110
Matt my coworker to who was also there

441
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,220
to help me and just when you're insecure

442
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,420
about something and you have some

443
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,190
problem just you know saying it out loud

444
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,450
makes it so much smaller and easier even

445
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,910
though it can be hard but it really does

446
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,740
and now I can just you know laughs

447
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:01,550
laughs at this afterwards and meow so I

448
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,280
just really think you folks for coming

449
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,550
here and I would love to get the

450
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,380
