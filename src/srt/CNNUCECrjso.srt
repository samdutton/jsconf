00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,270

great I'm so excited to be here thank

2
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,640
you everybody so Nick talked a little

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,189
bit about me i do want to point out that

4
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,920
the links to all of the demos that I'm

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,539
going to use and some extra rating if

6
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,579
you're interested is always down there

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,710
at the bottom of the screen it's going

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,910
to be at KDK to github I yo /

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,890
localization so you can go ahead and

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,600
take a look at the list of links anytime

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,320
if you want to um so this happens to me

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,520
in the US kind of a lot I finish a build

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
like this in the CSS I've perfectly

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,250
established a lovely vertical grid that

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,949
the designer wanted all the images align

16
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,019
all the headlines align all of the

17
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,939
call-to-action buttons align it's great

18
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,510
it's perfect time for a donut and then I

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,150
switch into German

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,990
and it's terrible the long headlines

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,420
broke the grid that we had the buttons

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,300
the buttons are terrible that's we can't

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,510
have that it is not time for a donut

24
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,580
this happens kind of a lot even worse

25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,430
still in English when we let the content

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,960
owners go into the content management

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,970
system and they start changing the text

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,630
they move my buttons around again

29
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,350
honestly stop hit so probably this build

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,510
was not so perfect after all and we're

31
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,530
going to have to take care of it ah

32
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,660
Getty Images we localize our site into

33
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,210
over 20 different language and

34
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,790
localization versions so I've kind of

35
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,440
learned quite a lot in the past couple

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,910
years about how to build a site so that

37
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,350
it's going to work with a ton of

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,160
different text around it let me stop for

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,200
a minute just to talk about what exactly

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,650
is localization when pics are released

41
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,530
their Japanese dubbed version of inside

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,010
out they changed the green peppers from

43
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,810
the original broccoli from the original

44
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,570
version into green peppers because in

45
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,360
Japan green peppers are the universally

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
reviled vegetable for children

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,810
localization can include emotional and

48
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,150
cultural changes like this as well as

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,260
just switching the language over

50
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,970
localization can also include all of the

51
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,560
different changes that you have to have

52
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,380
four units of measurement and even the

53
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,470
way that very large numbers are

54
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,930
formatted and today what I'm going to be

55
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,640
talking about is not the entire

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,470
localization stack that's a bigger

57
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,540
problem than I can solve in 30 minutes

58
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,610
but I'm going to talk about how to

59
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,060
handle all of those changes using CSS

60
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,330
the results of all of those changes and

61
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,580
and this isn't just for translated

62
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,590
content even if you're a small site who

63
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,209
doesn't have to worry about going into

64
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,090
multiple languages you probably have

65
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,400
content owners and a content management

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,010
system or perhaps you have

67
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,260
user-generated content or content coming

68
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,440
from a database and at the very least I

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,570
would urge you to consider respecting

70
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,450
the device font sizes when a user with

71
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,380
less than

72
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,110
our vision changes their font size to be

73
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,790
a little bit bigger so that your boxes

74
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,440
don't break when that happens okay cool

75
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,020
so let's first talk about images and

76
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,590
embedded text embedded in images don't

77
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,180
worry this is not going to be the last

78
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,320
kitten that I'm going to show you today

79
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,940
I know you're concerned what we want is

80
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,340
we want for the image to be the exact

81
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,220
same on every version of our site but we

82
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,410
want the text to change okay well that's

83
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,260
not too hard but um I don't really want

84
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,930
to host 20 different images with 20

85
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,550
different languages embedded in the text

86
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,940
do I worse whenever the text changes I

87
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,590
don't want to make 20 new images in

88
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,550
Photoshop yuck so instead we're going to

89
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,250
use our modern CSS skills to let the

90
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,910
text be text and the image be an image

91
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,410
why do we care so much about letting the

92
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,680
text be text maybe we want a foreign

93
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,060
trained traveler to be able to buy a

94
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,390
train ticket that would be great maybe

95
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,390
for SEO that's kind of important i guess

96
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,670
uh uh yeah so text should just stay text

97
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,230
that would be better languages are often

98
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,930
much different sizes here we have German

99
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,960
it's three lines long German in Spanish

100
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,010
are usually much longer than English

101
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,930
Japanese and Hebrew for example I'm

102
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,970
often much shorter than English so we

103
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,170
have to worry about making sure that our

104
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,840
box is going to be different sizes in

105
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,610
both directions okay cool let's start

106
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,680
with the markup and then some pretty

107
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,480
simple styles throughout i'm not going

108
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,830
to show you the reset so i assume you

109
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,050
all already know all about that in case

110
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,570
you haven't seen it before the figure is

111
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,510
a new element with html5 and it is

112
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,340
perfect for containing both an image

113
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,370
just an image tag and a caption which is

114
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,990
the text its associated with the image

115
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,360
such lovely because we can semantically

116
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,460
associate our image and its text

117
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,090
together double thumbs up yeah and then

118
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,340
we have some not too exciting styling

119
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,040
where we set some sizes and the color on

120
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,710
our caption image

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,860
the first thing we're going to do is

122
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,050
we're going to want to position the

123
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,300
bottom of the fig caption element to the

124
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,060
bottom of the figure element okay we can

125
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,880
do that using position absolute right

126
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,450
bottom zero at close what's going to

127
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,980
position it to the bottom of the

128
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,800
containing of the the viewport the

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,300
browser window because it's positioned

130
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,230
absolutely for everything instead what

131
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,230
we also need to do is to capture the fig

132
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,020
captions position in context by adding

133
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,680
position relative on the parent figure

134
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,540
element itself thus we now have the

135
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,980
caption at the bottom of the figure

136
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,510
element it's been captured so cool cool

137
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,340
next let's take care of those let's take

138
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,320
care of those pink stripes on the side

139
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,890
that's pretty ugly the cool thing we can

140
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,820
do with this is we can use the CSS

141
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,410
intrinsic width module now this is

142
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,780
relatively new so do check the browser

143
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,090
support that you use earlier yoona

144
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,130
mentioned can i use calm and that's a

145
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,140
great way to see what supported you can

146
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,570
also use the Mozilla developer network

147
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,310
to get a good idea of whether the thing

148
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,690
that you need to use is supported for

149
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,840
your browser do we use a fallback in

150
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,720
this case i've used macs with 400 pixels

151
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,450
and then that's overrated overwritten by

152
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,729
browsers that support it with Max with

153
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:05,940
Max content and what I've said it to be

154
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,990
is max content Nick told the choke using

155
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,250
yeah max content earlier what this means

156
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,930
is it's going to make the parent

157
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,600
elements maximum with only as wide as it

158
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,450
needs to be to contain all of its

159
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,190
children so this is what gives us this

160
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,450
we don't have those pink stripes anymore

161
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,430
it's just contained by its content which

162
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,790
is pretty sweet the last thing that we

163
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,729
need to do is set a max height and a max

164
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,400
width on the image itself so that it can

165
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,900
be responsive inside its figure parent

166
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,570
and then we take a look at this in all

167
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,010
three different languages that we looked

168
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,770
at before we're like great that is

169
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,789
exact same CSS for every language and it

170
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:55,319
doesn't break no matter which language

171
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,360
were using it's awesome that's awesome

172
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,639
good cool there are also ways to use

173
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,009
different CSS for different languages

174
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,220
and we can you've probably seen before

175
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,220
how to specify the exactly perfect

176
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,310
typographic quotes for an element using

177
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,550
the quotes declaration inside q we can

178
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,889
just stick any Unicode this is the

179
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,860
Unicode for fancy-pants opening quote

180
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,330
Unicode for a fancy-pants closing

181
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,000
opening quote any Unicode in there will

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,220
work and that's great for default if the

183
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,199
majority of folks who visit your site

184
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,760
are using are going to be reading it in

185
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,620
english but in germany i'm told that we

186
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,209
use different quote marks those funny

187
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:41,250
little guys down at the bottom no

188
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,649
problem on the HTML we can set a

189
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:49,290
language attribute equal to d e and now

190
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,149
in normally you probably want to put the

191
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:52,950
language attribute on your body element

192
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,529
but in this case just for demos you can

193
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:57,230
stuff it on any old element you want

194
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,480
then this is paired with the language

195
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,500
pseudo class in the CSS and different

196
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,610
unicode characters for the quote marks

197
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:14,070
awesome great same thing for japanese we

198
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,079
want to have different quote marks so we

199
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:19,110
just match the Jaypee language attribute

200
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,140
for the quote element with a JP pseudo

201
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,320
class for the quote elements and you can

202
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,029
just paste the marks in there directly

203
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:28,740
if you don't want to track down their

204
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,180
unicode codes that works too i mentioned

205
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,980
before that this will work with any set

206
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,120
of unicode or any characters so what

207
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,850
I've done here is I've stolen the

208
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,279
language code for Esperanto to make an

209
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,140
emoji version of the quote that I was

210
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,230
using before the the values that are

211
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,329
legal inside these attributes come from

212
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,570
the iso 639 language codes which you can

213
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,730
google for there's really a lot and I

214
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,120
just stole Esperanto s which is e 0 NE 0

215
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,560
and so I've decided that for

216
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,360
oh gee we're going to open our quotes

217
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,910
with donut we're going to close it with

218
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,040
coffee and that's what we see over here

219
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:19,790
donut and coffee so y'all have probably

220
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,839
seen text transform before and perhaps

221
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,430
you know that in the past there were

222
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,560
some problems with the implementations

223
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,160
of text transform in browsers the most

224
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,560
recent updates to the CSS to text

225
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,570
transform law module lay out some

226
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,980
additional rules which correct problems

227
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,110
from previous modules and that's pretty

228
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,960
awesome for example one of the problems

229
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,870
previously was that if using text

230
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,850
transform capitalize which is supposed

231
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,740
to capitalize every word in a character

232
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,680
that works pretty good but right in here

233
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,140
this idea graph for Dutch both

234
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,190
characters are supposed to be

235
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,390
capitalized because they're kind of

236
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,370
considered a d1 character and that's

237
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,550
fixed in the most current version of the

238
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,650
css3 module and most browsers support it

239
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,230
chrome does super the most recent

240
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,570
version of Firefox also supports another

241
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,140
fix one of the problems was that in

242
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,500
German the SS character when it's

243
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,900
capitalized is supposed to be 2 s's not

244
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,339
the shoes that you've probably seen

245
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:25,580
before well firefox fixes that swell

246
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:32,390
great super but I Microsoft edge doesn't

247
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,600
quite do that we've still got shoes

248
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,160
hanging out there when it should be to

249
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,370
us as instead sadface so some of the

250
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,600
updates are available in a lot of

251
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,390
browsers but not all of them are and in

252
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,060
fact I would encourage you to be really

253
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,190
really cautious with any use of text

254
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,180
transform period because for me it's

255
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,300
trey is really really close to the idea

256
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,470
of using CSS which is for styling to

257
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,430
change the content of a language for

258
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,170
example you probably saw the Wi-Fi

259
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,180
password was in all caps because it

260
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,610
looked lovely on the slideshow but when

261
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,900
you type the Wi-Fi password and it's

262
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,279
supposed to be lowercase

263
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:19,759
so probably just let the content owners

264
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,829
the text writers write what they mean

265
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:24,139
instead of forcing style changes upon

266
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,600
them in the CSS probably stay away from

267
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,939
that but if you're thinking about using

268
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:31,249
text transform if you must check the

269
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:33,019
specs because it sort of kind of works

270
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,819
better than it used to and that's what

271
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:41,029
we can expect now let's take a look at

272
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,339
headlines which are a fairly common

273
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:45,860
element that you'll see in a lot of

274
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,740
designs in fact this is a fairly common

275
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,199
design that I get from my designer where

276
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:53,420
they want the headline to be scooched in

277
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,670
a little bit from the containing box for

278
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,499
emphasis because the headline is

279
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:59,360
obviously looking much more interesting

280
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,009
if it's scooched in from the rest of the

281
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,809
text and it's got a centered

282
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:05,360
call-to-action button cool pretty

283
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,589
standard this should not be hard at all

284
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:08,360
you would not believe how many slides i

285
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,430
actually have on this head ok well the

286
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,290
market is pretty simple we're just going

287
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,639
to start with a section that will give

288
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,379
us a place to throw our gradient on and

289
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:19,939
the section is going to contain a

290
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:22,069
headline we're going to put a line break

291
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,170
in the headline and we're going to have

292
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,389
an anchor to be our call to action

293
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,720
button so that's pretty cool yeah we're

294
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,910
going to affect that big fat Martin

295
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,519
margin just by stuffing it on the

296
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,309
section element so we've given a side

297
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:41,569
padding of uh we've given a top padding

298
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:43,459
of three rounds and a slide padding of

299
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,110
five rounds to scoop to everything in oh

300
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,329
okay should be great great yeah perfect

301
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,230
time for that donut after all right no

302
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,220
no as soon as we change the window to be

303
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,290
a little bit skinnier than before it

304
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,559
starts to look a little odd and in

305
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,509
reality if you have a responsive site

306
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:08,089
your Tennessee skinny or Windows all the

307
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:14,569
time also oh that German it begins to

308
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:16,970
look weird again okay well we'll do

309
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,740
better will iterate on this headline a

310
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:24,110
little so instead of just adding a big

311
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,029
giant margin just Guiche everything in

312
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,160
let's let's tone that down a little bit

313
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,990
or sorry padding we're going to change

314
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,610
the padding a little bit and make it

315
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,220
just three rounds in two rounds and then

316
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,300
we're going to give the headline the

317
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,190
more specific styling we're going to

318
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,930
make the headline element eighty five

319
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,000
percent of the width and we're going to

320
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,740
give it large and left auto and margin

321
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,480
right auto which is how we've been

322
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,089
centering elements for years okay okay

323
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,540
great that looks pretty good here we are

324
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,920
highlighting the element than just

325
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,569
showing the padding on the outside that

326
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:58,970
looks much better we still have the

327
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,100
squeeze effect on the headline super in

328
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,720
fact if we think ahead to what the

329
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,519
content owners might do someone might

330
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,259
come along and add a paragraph to this

331
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,029
element without even telling the poor

332
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:13,250
developers first and it's still going to

333
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,050
look good because we've scooched in the

334
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,240
headline itself instead of kin trusting

335
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,649
that the container is going to take care

336
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,220
of the big fat padding for us god it

337
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,899
still looks a little awkward in German

338
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:26,839
though I wish I wish there was something

339
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,029
more to do about fallen hoon hanging out

340
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,720
down at the bottom there ok tangent time

341
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,600
let's talk about widows and orphans has

342
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,310
anybody heard of the term widows and

343
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,269
orphans before excellent excellent it's

344
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:43,189
the single lines that are cut off from

345
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:45,620
the bottom of their blocks this line of

346
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,319
text down here at the bottom that's a

347
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:50,959
widow and this other line of text all

348
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,810
alone way up at the top that's an orphan

349
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,850
you all know that this came from the

350
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,500
days of print and typesetting when you

351
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,670
would move your little blocks around

352
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,410
then squish ink on it and in CSS widow

353
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,300
and orphan declarations are supported

354
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,339
when using page media when you're using

355
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,069
print media type you can specify how

356
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,569
many lines you want left alone at the

357
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:13,610
end of the page or the top of a new page

358
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,300
and that's awesome that's cool you can

359
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,660
also do it in columns sort of kind of in

360
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,399
some browsers these declarations in the

361
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,339
CSS should mean that the browser will

362
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,170
attempt to rebalance all of the text in

363
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,809
the columns so that three is the fewest

364
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:34,670
number of lines left alone either at the

365
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,370
top or the bottom of any single column

366
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,730
and in browses where it works

367
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,089
it works great currently it works in

368
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:46,250
edge 20 that's the current version of

369
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,440
edge and iOS Safari eight awesome does

370
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,510
not work in the most recent version of

371
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:59,329
Firefox or Chrome or OSX Safari okay

372
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,040
that's fine that's fine a progressive

373
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,360
enhancement it's fine you can just use

374
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,140
it and it'll be fine but wouldn't it be

375
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,870
great if we could use orphans for

376
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,750
something else let go imagine for me

377
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,130
this is not real this doesn't actually

378
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,220
work but imagine that you have a bunch

379
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,439
of elements like this more kittens which

380
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,319
you laid out with flex box and at the

381
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,480
end you've got this one little kitten

382
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,569
hanging out all alone it's sad and

383
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,459
lonely and it's much too long and it

384
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:33,169
looks weird what if you could specify an

385
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:36,440
orphans declaration on the containing

386
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,770
elements then the browser would stick

387
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,230
these two kittens together because we've

388
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,290
specified minimum number of children to

389
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,210
be rendered after a soft line break is

390
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,360
too that would be awesome that would be

391
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,690
much better are you hearing me browser

392
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,270
vendors orphans for other things pretty

393
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:04,220
please thank you okay yeah okay

394
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,940
yeah yeah this thing so we can also use

395
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,910
it to fix our headline for example we

396
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,890
could declare it would be great if we

397
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,230
could say that the minimum number of

398
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,630
words things separated by spaces left

399
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,820
alone at the bottom of the h1 would be

400
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,590
four and then the browser would just

401
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,030
steal some words above and make it

402
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,440
balance just like it does for Collins

403
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,020
that would be wonderful if we could do

404
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:34,890
it for our headline okay oh great so we

405
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,380
can't yet but maybe someday to be great

406
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,179
okay there's one I told you there were a

407
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,559
lot of slides about headline but we're

408
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,730
almost done there's one more reasonably

409
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,630
labor-intensive thing that you can do if

410
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,660
you absolutely must to take care of line

411
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,020
breaks to handle ugly-looking headlines

412
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,660
in this image what we have is a yellow

413
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,270
line that I drew in there to represent

414
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,890
the line break remember in the beginning

415
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,820
I put a hard line break in the mark-up

416
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,299
we can compare we can use this with

417
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:11,730
media queries and we can hide the line

418
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,190
breaks in certain scenarios here for

419
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,260
view ports that are less than 500 pixels

420
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,090
wide we're going to display the line

421
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,320
break is normal that's fine swell cool

422
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,020
but for wider view ports the line breaks

423
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,790
still exists we're just not going to

424
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,419
show it so if you really must force line

425
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,640
breaks into your code or allow your

426
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,980
content owners to force line breaks into

427
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,900
the content that they're writing you can

428
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,210
absolutely show and hide them using

429
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,900
media queries so yeah that's pretty cool

430
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,360
it's probably the best way right now to

431
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,790
handle the ugly headline but it's pretty

432
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:53,760
labor-intensive so it's your call the

433
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,400
last saw mo I'm going to go back to

434
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
talking about the group of boxes because

435
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,140
we have some pretty good fixes for that

436
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,669
what we want what the comp says is that

437
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,370
we're going to have three boxes all side

438
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,470
by side they're all going to be the same

439
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,290
height and they're going to be nicely

440
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,940
aligned the paragraphs are going to

441
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,890
start at the same place and the

442
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,990
call-to-action buttons are going to

443
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,549
start at the same place

444
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,039
now back in the day you might have done

445
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,619
this with tables because when you use

446
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,690
tables you get all that alignment

447
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,749
between rows for free and that's awesome

448
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:31,019
but this is not tabular data so we're

449
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,389
not going to use tables it's also going

450
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:35,610
to look pretty terrible when we need a

451
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,220
single column view for a mobile kind of

452
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,009
browser with let's let's take a look at

453
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:44,759
how we might accomplish this the mark-up

454
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,070
is you know not too exciting we're going

455
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,749
to use a section to contain all three of

456
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,149
the boxes and then inside there we're

457
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,919
going to have a div with a class of

458
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,200
group contain each of the columns in

459
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,210
there and each of those contains a

460
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,639
headline and a paragraph and a button

461
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:04,289
pretty standard pretty awesome the

462
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:05,730
styling we're going to start out pretty

463
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,429
simple at least these days we get curved

464
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,499
corners almost for free so that's

465
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:13,470
awesome so we're going to curve the

466
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,029
corners with good old border radius

467
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,190
we're going to send you some things add

468
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,940
some background colors cool simple stuff

469
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,239
we're going to do a lot of work on the

470
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,399
button but it's not too exciting really

471
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:28,799
the most exciting thing on the button is

472
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,980
that we're going to give it a width of

473
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,359
sixty percent and we're going to send to

474
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,269
write using margin again and let's talk

475
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:38,070
for a minute about why we can send your

476
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,109
things using margin auto on the left and

477
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:42,269
margin auto on the right that's kind of

478
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:45,899
weird why does it work well what happens

479
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:48,779
is that the auto Declaration takes all

480
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,489
of the available space on the side that

481
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:52,649
it's talking about and then it uses that

482
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:54,239
and it's okay that's my space now and

483
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:56,340
then it divides that between everything

484
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,169
that's going to use some of that space

485
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:00,389
so auto on the left takes half the

486
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:03,149
available space auto on the right takes

487
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:05,309
half the available space and thus the

488
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:07,049
element which is no longer a hundred

489
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,179
percent of the width is centered inside

490
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:12,690
its container so that's that's my maybe

491
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,489
interesting about auto we'll see okay

492
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:21,029
cool let's take care of the boxes for

493
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:23,159
each of the groups to keep them all the

494
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,049
same height and side by side we're going

495
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,639
to use our friend flexbox now again

496
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,749
flexbox still need some prefixing

497
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,320
another brow

498
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,740
so check out can I use or the Mozilla

499
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,300
developer network to see what you need

500
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,380
to add to get it to work in your

501
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,080
browser's flexbox is great because it

502
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,810
gives us this auto alignment the it's

503
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,060
set to stretch by default everything's

504
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,560
the same height all of that comes pretty

505
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,090
much for free the only thing I had to

506
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,030
add was display flex on the parent

507
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:56,640
section so that's awesome and we're also

508
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,090
going to set display flex inside each of

509
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,500
these container boxes we don't want to

510
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,260
use the default direction of rows

511
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,720
instead we want the Flex direction

512
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,650
inside these to be columns so that's

513
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,870
cool I don't know it didn't really make

514
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,680
a big difference inside but what it does

515
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,710
do it sets us up to move all of the

516
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,770
buttons to the bottom and the reason

517
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,060
that all the buttons are at the bottom

518
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,050
is that I've set the margin top to the

519
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,690
auto before I mentioned that auto takes

520
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,400
up all of this vailable space and

521
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,100
flexbox it does that on the top two so

522
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,590
now all of these buttons just have huge

523
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,340
margins when they can from the top of

524
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,400
their available space so margin auto

525
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,620
within flexbox scooches everything down

526
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,390
to the bottom all of our buttons are

527
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,270
aligned that's awesome the only thing we

528
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,850
need to do is to get those paragraphs of

529
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,650
copy aligned ah how do we do that

530
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,940
they're all within different parents

531
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,680
they don't inherently have any

532
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,400
relationship to them to each other so

533
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,020
we're going to have to cheat it's going

534
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,330
to be okay what we're going to do is

535
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,120
we're going to steal some of the margin

536
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,830
for our H ones we're going to set that

537
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,320
to margin zero steal that margin and

538
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,810
instead we're going to tell them that

539
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,490
each of these elements has a minimum

540
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:29,220
height of 10 our EMS of 10 rounds so

541
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,620
instead this white space is just made up

542
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,300
by this element having a height now in

543
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,060
cases where the headline contents are

544
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,190
actually taller than 10 REMS what's

545
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,540
going to happen

546
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,160
is it's going to push the paragraphs

547
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,410
down and every box is going to have the

548
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,080
same bottom line to it the boxes are

549
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,880
still going to be aligned but the

550
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,980
paragraphs won't be because one

551
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,240
paragraph will be pushed down much

552
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,310
further by its headline than the other

553
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:00,150
ones and I think that's okay because the

554
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,950
alternate option if we were to use just

555
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,930
height instead of men height would mean

556
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,590
that for very long hy elements we would

557
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,150
be cut off at the bottom when the

558
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,580
content don't fit inside the elements so

559
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,650
I think it's better to suffer some

560
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,200
layout to some layout breakage than to

561
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,400
kill content for the users wow so that

562
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,640
was a lot of CSS that I just threw at

563
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,830
you all let's let's take a look at what

564
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,830
we did already today we looked at how to

565
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,080
position a caption at the bottom of its

566
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,450
parent using position relative to

567
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,970
capture the containing context and also

568
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,330
how to size it based on its parent using

569
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:44,340
Mac's content which is very awesome we

570
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,250
looked at how to use the language a

571
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,990
tribute and the same language

572
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,380
pseudo-class to do any kind of quote

573
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,570
marks that you want and this will allow

574
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,610
you to any styling that you want

575
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,050
different for different languages if

576
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,850
it's necessary for your site you can

577
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,800
increase the type chinese text size but

578
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:07,020
only for chinese we talked about how to

579
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,140
use text transform how it's changed with

580
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,080
the recent CSS module updates and how

581
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,760
maybe you want to be really really

582
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,770
deliberate and thoughtful before just

583
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:22,080
throwing it on your headlines we talked

584
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,040
about a wish for using orphans and widow

585
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,930
declarations in things other than paged

586
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,980
media or columns that would be pretty

587
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,150
swell we talked a lot about how you can

588
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,550
corral headlines down to pin this the

589
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,860
page size I think that the best standard

590
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,120
solution is just to give it a different

591
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,790
with and center it but you can also show

592
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,500
and hide the line breaks if you really

593
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,940
want to and we also talked about how can

594
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,570
use flex box to magically auto align a

595
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,420
bunch of things inside there

596
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,040
most interestingly i think is the way

597
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:05,310
the top margin auto works so of course

598
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,410
you can combine any of these techniques

599
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,020
as you need to I think the important

600
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,840
thing to think about is to plan for the

601
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,790
text size that you put out there to vary

602
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,010
because content owners are going to

603
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,770
change it users who up their font size

604
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,870
are going to change it and even if you

605
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,270
include any content that's dynamic from

606
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,850
a database or from the users or from

607
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,680
translations that's going to change the

608
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,500
size of boxes that you need on your

609
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:36,550
website so just go ahead and plan for it

610
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,050
building a robust site that survived the

611
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,750
localization process is going to be

612
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,640
building a site which handles all of

613
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,200
these so that's what I came to talk

614
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,870
about again if you want you can get the

615
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,620
links from KDK to github do /

616
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,990
localizations or you can follow me on

617
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,390
twitter or read them up my blog which I

618
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,210
