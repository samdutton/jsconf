1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,080

[Laughter]

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,000
so yeah I'm Luke bonaccorsi I'm a

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,799
software engineer at sky betting and

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,900
gaming which is a online gambling

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,540
company based in Leeds in the north of

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,280
England

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,770
I'm also the organiser of the local

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,580
JavaScript me up in Leeds Leeds yes I've

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,189
been building stuff since I was about 12

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,189
for the web which is like over 15 years

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,980
and I just found it so cool that you

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,740
could put stuff on the internet cuz like

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,120
that was 2001 2002 when it was kind of

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,950
broadband was just starting to become a

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,559
thing and yeah it was super cool you

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,910
could put stuff on the internet and I've

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,690
been hooked on it ever since and yeah

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,070
I'm here to talk about how I in the

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,899
report and make my curtains and shouting

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,559
on my laptop so I'm lazy if there's a

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,809
way I can not do something I won't do it

22
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,930
and because of that automations an

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,300
amazing thing I can just automate the

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,530
boring stuff away and every day we're

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,030
surrounded by automation and we probably

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,460
don't realize it so there's stuff like

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,540
traffic lights automatic doors motion

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,640
sensing lights automatic hand dryers

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,670
cash machines and that's just stuff I

30
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,860
noticed and paid attention to today and

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,479
it shows how prevalent is in our

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,320
everyday lives and as consumers we're

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,770
embracing it more and more in our homes

34
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,210
there's heating with the Nest's

35
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,549
thermostat and lighting like Charlie

36
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,890
mentioned with the philips hue and even

37
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,119
though you're getting in the game now

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,780
with really really cheap smart light

39
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,180
bulbs and then there's access control

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,840
with things like smart door locks and

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,030
these things usually have api so you can

42
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,280
hook them up and interact with them

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,960
however you want so you can do like a

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,759
node scripts and run it from the command

45
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,579
line if you want to do that for some

46
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,640
reason or you can create a node service

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
and have a dashboard and hook all your

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,030
different bits of home automation

49
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,250
together so you've got like your lights

50
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,410
and your heating and your door and it's

51
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,300
all in one place and you just know I go

52
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,960
here and this is

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,940
it is and as developers we use

54
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,100
automation to make our lives easier and

55
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,580
more efficient and their stuff like

56
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,170
build tooling so you can run a single

57
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,780
command and it does a chain of things

58
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,850
like linting running your tests

59
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,470
transpiling pulling it through a web

60
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,980
pack and there's also automated tests so

61
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,200
you've got functional tests where it'll

62
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,870
run in a headless browser and check

63
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,730
things and see how they behave and how

64
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,880
they look and make sure it's right and

65
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,410
then there's unit tests so you're

66
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,580
checking your input and your output and

67
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,430
making sure that it's what you want and

68
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,630
you're not having to go through and

69
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,010
check that manually every time you make

70
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,260
a change and even infrastructure

71
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,420
configuration so you can build up a

72
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,000
server just with a set of scripts using

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,080
something like chef or ansible but as

74
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,060
interesting as that stuff can be I'm not

75
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,870
here to talk about that over the past

76
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,330
couple years there's been a bot up

77
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,800
rising I'm calling it that anyway

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,790
they're quickly becoming a bigger and

79
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,190
bigger part of our lives and helping us

80
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,450
with everyday things it's stuff like my

81
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,330
work we have a release token it's a

82
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,060
really really really simple bot you send

83
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,880
it message and then it adds you to a

84
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,400
queue when it's your turn it sends you a

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,620
message back saying hey Luke it's your

86
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,590
go you do your release you test it you

87
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,170
do whatever you need to do and then drop

88
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,850
the token in messages the next person in

89
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,070
the queue but it makes that stuff more

90
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,510
efficient someone isn't having to

91
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,120
monitor who's doing what it's dealt with

92
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,090
by the bots and then CNN have a Facebook

93
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,540
Bob that it can give you headlines when

94
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,220
stuff happens that you're interested in

95
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,710
you can subscribe to it by sending a

96
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,300
message saying I want to know about this

97
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,310
topic and it'll send you stuff about

98
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,460
that as it goes on and even Domino's

99
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,380
have got a bot that you can message to

100
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,890
order pizza and that's excellent because

101
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,780
making it easier to get pizzas even

102
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,790
better and these things can be hooked

103
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,440
directly into a chat system so you can

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,720
create something really quick and simple

105
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,040
with node modules for stuff like slack

106
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,360
and Facebook and they have great

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,760
examples for these things as well and it

108
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,400
means that in an afternoon or less you

109
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,050
can even spin up a bot that has a single

110
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,570
task and pull it into your workflow and

111
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,830
then there are frameworks that make it

112
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,450
easy to do these things as well so you

113
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,130
can have a bot that has multiple

114
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,770
functionalities and hooks into multiple

115
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,410
chat systems and there's stuff like

116
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,010
Microsoft's bot framework and one called

117
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,520
bot kit as well and then there's github

118
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,390
Hugh bot they call get Hugh bot the

119
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,370
hardest-working github er because it

120
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,570
does absolutely everything

121
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,460
it sits throughout their organization

122
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,200
and just does everything so there's

123
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,670
stuff like they can use it to deploy

124
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,310
codes they send a message it updates the

125
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,740
code that's running live or provisioning

126
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,870
Hardware so they send a message it

127
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,090
installs the operating system it

128
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,810
configures it does a test with a burnin

129
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,970
puts the live code on it adds it to the

130
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,260
library infrastructure and then it's

131
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,650
done or even visitors so when a visitor

132
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,560
walks in there's an iPad and they tap

133
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,720
their name into the iPads and then it

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,070
just sends a message to whoever they're

135
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,630
supposed to be meeting saying hey your

136
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,770
guests here even controls the music they

137
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,120
have a system throughout their offices

138
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,500
where music is just shared and employees

139
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,360
can control it by sending messages to

140
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,260
like cue and skip tracks and it does

141
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,960
simple things like that and it makes

142
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,400
their lives easier and we've now got

143
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,570
virtual assistants

144
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,640
so that's stuff like Siri and Alexa and

145
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,590
Google assistant and they're basically

146
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,800
box but a bit smarter and you can get

147
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,840
them on your phone through the web and

148
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,970
they're built into the OS of things like

149
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,490
Windows 10 and Chrome OS and there are

150
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,490
in our homes with stuff like the Google

151
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,920
home and the Amazon echo and they help

152
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,740
us out with things like reading reading

153
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,150
you out news that you're interested in

154
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,840
and playing music and buying things even

155
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,430
if that doesn't necessarily go well when

156
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,000
the news reads out a report

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,790
some of that going bad and again it's

158
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,440
quite easy to add your own abilities to

159
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,840
these things you can just write a node

160
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,100
service for it

161
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,890
glitch comm which is an amazing website

162
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,380
which is a collaborative editor and it

163
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,240
has a load of templates and it has help

164
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,120
functionality they have templates for

165
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,270
google home and alexa and it took me an

166
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,620
evening to add a basic one that just

167
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,570
pulls quotes from rick wikiquote and

168
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,380
reads them out to you and yeah it's

169
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,090
amazing that you can get hooking to

170
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,990
these things within evening and the

171
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,310
operating is only just beginning

172
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,840
BOTS and assistants that we're going to

173
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,060
become far more common and far more

174
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:33,169
prevalent so in mid 2014 I started

175
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,270
working on my own chat bot and it all

176
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,200
makes things for me so it's called

177
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,020
Woodhouse it's named after the butler on

178
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,500
the TV show Archer I was going to call

179
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,510
it Jarvis and then how to think about it

180
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,750
and realized it's over done and it

181
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,640
wasn't gonna be anywhere as near as good

182
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,770
as Jarvis would be so I picked a worse

183
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:04,700
Butler and picked Woodhouse so it's much

184
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,320
more extensible it's got a core which is

185
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,880
just some common functionality like

186
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,830
routing broadcasting scheduling and some

187
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,570
preference storage stuff as well as a

188
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,610
few other bits and then it's got a

189
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,220
couple of types of modules so that you

190
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,570
can get it to do stuff so there's

191
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,210
plugins which do whatever you want they

192
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,640
handle the heavy lifting so you can get

193
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,190
it to reply with texts or connect to an

194
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,800
API or interface with a piece of

195
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,500
hardware and then there's interfaces

196
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,180
which ways to communicate with it which

197
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,909
is usually a chat system so that's like

198
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,520
Google Hangouts or facebook chat or

199
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,270
slack or hip chat and if so if there's a

200
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,160
way you can connect it you can probably

201
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,920
connect it a lot of these things as I

202
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,680
mentioned earlier have a NPM

203
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,399
or for it it's all open source and

204
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,470
JavaScript's it runs on node it sits on

205
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,480
a Raspberry Pi behind my TV in my living

206
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,200
room and it's all MIT license because

207
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,330
why the hell not and I might change that

208
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,820
after Boyles talked earlier and then yes

209
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,970
all up and github it there's the link at

210
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,649
the ends and you can all have a look and

211
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,950
poke and delete and whatever you want

212
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,750
and have a try so yeah in the beginning

213
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,200
I only wanted to download movies so I

214
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,550
was sat at my previous company with one

215
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,529
of my co-workers waiting for a meeting

216
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:39,770
start and he had his iPads he was

217
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,380
connected by VPN into his Raspberry Pi

218
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,170
at home was just sat queuing up movies

219
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,850
to downloads and I thought that seemed

220
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,850
like a lot of effort I knew of software

221
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,860
that could download movies I knew it had

222
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,870
an API I just wanted to be able to send

223
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,480
a message it to send me an IND be linked

224
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,779
say is this the film you meant I go yeah

225
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,070
cool it just goes and downloads but

226
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,900
before I managed to do that I can't

227
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,730
remember how but I am managed to

228
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:15,310
automate my lamps instead so this is a

229
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,320
sending message

230
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,450
the lamps go off send another message

231
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:28,550
and then the lamps come back on and to

232
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,700
me that's amazing because as developers

233
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,010
we don't get as JavaScript developers we

234
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,570
generally don't get a real-world effect

235
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,140
of our codes so I was just sat there

236
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,430
typing the messages and hitting Enter

237
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,260
and as the lights were going off on off

238
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,829
and on just giggling to myself because

239
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:51,320
yes it's amazing and then so this is the

240
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,350
hardware for it it's a cheap Wi-Fi plug

241
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,630
that I got from China for about 15 euros

242
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,260
and because it's got the Chinese plug on

243
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,329
the back I have to use an adapter which

244
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:07,890
means it's super safe

245
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,390
and then by just like poking around at

246
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,950
the network connection for it I found

247
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,410
that it had telnet exposed and you could

248
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,050
drop into it through that and then I

249
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,540
found a Google group which they'd been

250
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,190
exploring and they'd found the SSH

251
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,230
password and it runs open wrt which is a

252
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,870
small Linux distribution for routers and

253
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,700
it's got a web server on it so that

254
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,760
means that we can put scripts on it and

255
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,880
make it do stuff when you hear a page so

256
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,680
I've got it so that you hit a page with

257
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,660
the certain parameter and it turns the

258
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,550
relay on hit it with a different

259
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,710
parameter it turns the relay off and

260
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,370
then another page to request the status

261
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,220
so you can tell if it's on or off and

262
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,260
then there's also script on there that

263
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,320
broadcasts the name the IP and some tags

264
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,270
so that I can group it into certain

265
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,460
sections every two minutes so that

266
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,970
Woodhouse can pick up the plug and then

267
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:10,450
a page configure those items as well and

268
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,680
I use this every day so as I get off the

269
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,400
bus after work I'll send a message and

270
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,770
it'll have my lamps on or if I'm driving

271
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,460
I will shout to my phone and use Google

272
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,220
now to tell it to send a message to

273
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,350
Woodhouse and turn the lamps on which

274
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,780
means that I get home the lights are on

275
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,180
I'm not stepping on anything that's been

276
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,000
put through the door I'm not looking

277
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,410
around for the light switch I just walk

278
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,900
in and do I'm gonna be doing it makes my

279
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,530
life easier and then I began adding

280
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,450
other little bits I eventually got round

281
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,760
to using to doing the TV and film

282
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,490
downloaders but I never actually used

283
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,440
them because streaming became popular

284
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,280
and easy with stuff like Netflix by

285
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,170
added like reminders so that I couldn't

286
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,200
put a pizza in the oven and then send a

287
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,240
message to tell it to remind me to get

288
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,740
the pizza out the oven because burnt

289
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,430
Pete's is terrible and I can check if

290
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,810
websites are up by sending it a message

291
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,830
saying Woodhouse is Google calm up

292
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,750
and it'll tell me yes or no using

293
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,310
something like down for everyone I'll

294
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,790
just me and then gift searches because

295
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,470
gifts are excellent who doesn't want

296
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,670
random gifts sent to their phone and I

297
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,620
started having all these random ideas of

298
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,120
stuff I could get its control like

299
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,000
everything but instead I started to

300
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,209
rewrite it because the old code was a

301
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,550
mess and I just been sort of chucking

302
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,930
things at it as I was getting really

303
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,200
excited about building it and it got to

304
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,209
a point that if I was doing a refactor

305
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:55,060
of anything or trying to build up a new

306
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,089
feature it would take way too long

307
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,250
because I'd have to untangle all this

308
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,660
stuff and figure out what he was doing

309
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,089
and why I did it like that and then

310
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:09,370
break things so I knew how it works and

311
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,640
I could structure it well and split up

312
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,300
into nice modules and I could use the s6

313
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,579
because noted advanced at that point

314
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:20,589
I've got to use all the nice stuff that

315
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,959
came with that and because it was node

316
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,520
it just worked and so I gave this talk

317
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,470
the first time in November last year and

318
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,970
I wanted to do something new so I ought

319
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,700
made my curtains so you send a message

320
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,950
and they open and it's really loud and

321
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,970
kind of creepy looking and send another

322
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,450
message and they'll close

323
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,340
and again it's a bit I can't imagine

324
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:58,160
what it looks like from the outside

325
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,390
so yeah the parts for that were pretty

326
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,180
basic we've got a plastic box that I

327
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,920
bought from a supermarket to hold

328
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,820
everything in a servo some string some

329
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,610
plastic wheels and some stuff to attach

330
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,590
it to curtain pole I've just realized

331
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,600
that sounds like I'm on a kids TV show

332
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,370
the explaining what you need to build

333
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,420
something and yeah the string just sits

334
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,940
in a loop with the curtains attached to

335
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,540
them by zip ties and whichever way the

336
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,090
cut the string rotates depends whether

337
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,610
they open or close and it's kind of

338
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,060
rubbish but it works and for the hard

339
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,100
for the actual hardware part of it is an

340
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,370
esp8266 which is a microcontroller like

341
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,910
an Arduino but it's got Wi-Fi and it

342
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,090
costs a couple of euros from China and

343
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,200
you can get this firmware called

344
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,700
Mongoose OS which means you can write

345
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,200
JavaScript in haven't instead of having

346
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,960
to do C I don't know C I just know

347
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,620
JavaScript and for getting it to control

348
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,630
my curtains and to configure it and

349
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,780
stuff like that I had 75 lines

350
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,000
it's got end points for opening closing

351
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,130
and to give me the status I can

352
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,590
configure it with some tags and a name

353
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,890
and how long the duration for the open

354
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,110
and close should be and also

355
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,690
broadcasting so that Woodhouse can pick

356
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,230
it up again and that's in 75 lines of of

357
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,940
hardware and there's so much cool stuff

358
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,130
for doing JavaScript and hardware

359
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,560
together so I've mentioned Mongoose

360
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,440
already but there's like johnny-five and

361
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,200
Cylon jeaious which they work on Arduino

362
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,670
and Raspberry Pi and then there's

363
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,200
development boards that have JavaScript

364
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,420
running on them like s Perino's and

365
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,050
tehsils

366
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,000
and they're a little bit more expensive

367
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,320
than nes ph 266 and loading mongoose or

368
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,450
on a mongoose arrest on it yourself but

369
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,300
they're a bit better supported and you

370
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,250
can use like MPM to run stuff on the

371
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,040
tehsil at least I know that

372
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,929
and that there's plenty more on the web

373
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:08,089
for this stuff as well like people like

374
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,620
hacking around at this stuff because

375
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,110
it's interesting it's fun and it makes

376
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,730
it easy to dive in and just get started

377
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,439
even if you have no experience with

378
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,020
hardware I have zero experience with

379
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,730
hardware and eventually I got boards

380
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,610
over Christmas and started shouting in

381
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,940
my laptop and it wasn't like code wasn't

382
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,460
working and being frustrated it was

383
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,330
generally to get boys controlled house

384
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:40,370
turn off lamps chair a lamp has been

385
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,740
turned off TV lamp has been turned off

386
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,260
couch lamp has been turned off Woodhouse

387
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:53,450
turn on lamps chair lamp has been turned

388
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,179
on TV lamp has been turned on couch lamp

389
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,690
has been turned on so yeah it's got the

390
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,540
worst reply voice ever but that's the

391
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,130
default in festival which is a

392
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,140
text-to-speech library on us speech

393
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,970
program on Linux and I'm sure if you've

394
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,280
run it unlike a Mac or some quiet that

395
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,140
it'll sound awesome but yes so the hot

396
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,090
word of shouting would house is offline

397
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,640
which there are no there's a lot of

398
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,590
privacy concerns for the Alexis stuff

399
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,240
where it's constantly recording you and

400
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,600
sending its Amazon service and that's

401
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,049
using the library called snowboy and you

402
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,160
train the model by going to their

403
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,740
website and saying whatever you want

404
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,260
you're hot were to be three times and

405
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,880
then for the main part of it I use

406
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,179
google speech API because they have a

407
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:46,809
ton more data than I will ever have and

408
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,700
it just makes it a lot easier you get 60

409
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,980
minutes free a month chunks into 15

410
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,860
second blocks but you could use

411
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,350
something like Amazon or Assurance ted's

412
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,750
but that's just literally when you want

413
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,669
it to actually do something because it's

414
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:03,650
triggered by the offline hot word and

415
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,070
the way this works is that I have or I

416
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,840
will have raspberry PI's scattered

417
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,760
around my house with a microphone and a

418
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,490
speaker and they deal with all that and

419
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,940
then just send

420
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,210
the actual converted texts turd the

421
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,650
central hub of Woodhouse why have a

422
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,290
central thing dealing with all the sort

423
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,500
of state and everything happening so

424
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,260
yeah that's the story of my strange home

425
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,720
automation stuff so far but it's only

426
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,780
just beginning I have so much stuff I

427
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,820
want to do with it like I want to add

428
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,950
the third module type of data providers

429
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,750
so that it can have like light sensors

430
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,220
and temperature sensors and have that

431
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,440
feeding and module subscribe to it stuff

432
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,010
like that

433
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,290
and then a recipe system like I have

434
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,630
triple T so that I don't even have to

435
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,450
send a message I just connect to my

436
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,450
network and it's dark outside and it

437
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,220
turns on my lamps and closes my curtains

438
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,320
so I can be even lazier and even like

439
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,270
natural language processing so I'm not

440
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,700
having to in the demo of the voice

441
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,980
control I barked a specific command that

442
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,960
didn't sound natural because it was wood

443
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,290
house turn off lounge lamps which feels

444
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,090
wrong it'd be nice to be able to say

445
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,800
wood house turn off of the lounge lamps

446
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,170
it feels a bit more conversational so

447
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,250
I'd love to get a bit more natural

448
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,650
language processing in there and even

449
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,050
have a unit in my car so that I can do

450
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,870
stuff like controlling the music and

451
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,250
contact the main hub to do stuff like

452
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,700
turning off my lamps so that it's easier

453
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,040
and I'm definitely don't want it to

454
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,600
control my car because that would be a

455
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,280
terrible idea and even more Hardware

456
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,570
stuff because I've really enjoyed having

457
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,730
a play with hardware and getting a

458
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,260
physical experience out of something

459
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,290
that we don't normally so stuff like

460
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,360
I've thought of how I could do a door

461
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,970
lock or light switches or even

462
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,280
controlling my thermostat my manager

463
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,440
told me how he does his with an Arduino

464
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,410
and a server it just like it's one of

465
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,110
those dial ones where it just rotates it

466
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,090
to the point that it needs to turn on or

467
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,610
off and that seems great and I kind of

468
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,420
want to do that now and I'm genuinely

469
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,130
terrified at the prospect of home

470
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,740
ownership not because of having a

471
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,840
mortgage or being growing up but recover

472
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,340
because I'll probably burn the house

473
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,550
down

474
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,420
so yeah the stylist talked I said I was

475
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,450
lazy

476
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,780
I want to correct that I'm the stupid

477
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,420
kinda lazy where I spend hundreds and

478
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,460
hundreds of hours making things so that

479
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,220
I don't have to do simple little tasks

480
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,130
like turning on my lamps and closing my

481
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,380
curtains but it goes further than that

482
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,090
I'm not here just to show off the cool

483
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,800
stuff I've built or at least I think

484
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,000
it's called I want to inspire you to

485
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,800
build some cool interesting things and

486
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
show you that you can do some different

487
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,030
things with JavaScript it's not just for

488
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,890
building like server runtimes and api's

489
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,480
or the front-end and I've learnt so much

490
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,670
whilst doing this stuff I've learned a

491
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,280
ton about JavaScript itself I've learned

492
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,200
about es6 whilst doing it I've learned

493
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,660
some stuff about UDP and some stuff

494
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,470
about hardware and I kept going down the

495
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,030
rabbit hole every time I came to

496
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,400
something new I'd find that ton more

497
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,890
stuff that I wanted to learn and I'd go

498
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,690
cold I'm gonna make a note of all this

499
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,960
and then just keep going and because I

500
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,630
found it interesting it was fun I would

501
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,140
keep going I even got a 3d printer

502
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,960
because of it I'm planning his second

503
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,460
version of the curtain opener that's way

504
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,860
better designed and like has a tension

505
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,480
system and stuff and I'll use the 3d

506
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,520
printer for that and have a load of

507
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,590
other stuff that I want to try and build

508
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,060
with the 3d printer and I realized a

509
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,620
great parallel when I was working on

510
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,380
this talk that one of my other big

511
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,740
passions is cooking in food and if you

512
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,840
were learning to cook you would learn by

513
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,460
cooking stuff that you want to eat it's

514
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,020
kind of wasteful if you're not

515
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,520
interested in it you're not gonna eat it

516
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,290
learning how to cook it it's even

517
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,030
difficult if you're not gonna eat it to

518
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,680
taste it and know that it's actually

519
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,180
done well and in a similar vein that

520
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,770
when you're learning stuff build

521
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,150
something that's weird and interesting

522
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,880
to you it'll keep you invested it will

523
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,620
keep you coming back and wanting to keep

524
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,410
going and building more you can hack it

525
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,420
you can cut corners you can refactor it

526
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,430
is you're learning and playing around

527
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,100
and being invested in it you're building

528
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,540
it for yourself it doesn't have to be

529
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,930
perfect you don't have to share it but

530
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,279
people will probably be

531
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:46,539
interested so thank you very much

532
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:49,809
and come and say hello and chat if you

533
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:52,899
see me around oh and there's the links

534
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:53,180
