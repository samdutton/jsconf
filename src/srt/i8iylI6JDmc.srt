1
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,410

oh yeah this is my talk the immersive

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,570
web in 2019 and there's a lot to the

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,400
and also 20 and a team just started so

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,570
it's gonna be a weird talk so the meat

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,849
of this talk is actually going to be pre

6
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:25,779
2019 and how we got here and I want to

7
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:28,660
talk a little bit about so before I talk

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,039
about the immersive web I want to talk

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,059
about just the web in general so if we

10
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:38,699
go very far back the web sort of started

11
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:40,570
everything I'm going to talk about today

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,230
is gonna involve the 3d web in the

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,420
immersive web but if we think about the

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,550
web as it started it was basically just

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,270
built for text documents and then we got

16
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,140
CSS level 1 and all of a sudden we could

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,850
do fancy things like style or buttons

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,010
and make make you know navigation bars

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,050
and that was fun and as things have

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,360
gotten progressively progressively more

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,460
advanced with high fidelity we've

22
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,009
started to do really let's say

23
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:14,380
questionable things like adding parallax

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,979
to every single page and creating you

25
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:19,720
know hiring somebody hiring an animator

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,490
to create a flash intro for your page

27
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,210
right like the web has always has been

28
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,700
progressively sort of adding more and

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,619
more visual fidelity as the years of

30
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:33,100
Warner have worn on and if you've ever

31
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,630
wanted to sort of completely break out

32
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,450
of the 3d context you would need to go

33
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,640
through WebGL and if you're not familiar

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,689
with WebGL

35
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,670
it's basically an API that operates

36
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,460
through the canvas API and it sort of

37
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,350
gives you a graphics context it's a

38
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,149
little square or a rectangle or whatever

39
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:52,030
shape you want it to be and it says okay

40
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,579
you control all the pixels here and you

41
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,579
would you most people don't program in

42
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,229
WebGL directly they use a helper library

43
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,630
so this is a gif of a few examples from

44
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,119
a three Jas which I'll be talking a

45
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:05,950
little bit more about for the rest of

46
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,369
this talk but yeah so if you've ever

47
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,459
wanted to sort of get into 3d on the web

48
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,100
it's always been very manual and you

49
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,440
even with these helper libraries it sort

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,030
of feels like you're playing in a

51
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,470
different environment

52
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,180
it doesn't feel sort of native to the

53
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,710
web and that all started to change

54
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,530
would say when Google cardboard was

55
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,890
first announced back in 2014 so this is

56
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,570
the first time that WebGL had been

57
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,620
hooked up to a to sort of a device so if

58
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,760
you have never if you've never

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,160
experienced sorry to a device that had a

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,550
gyroscope so if you've never experienced

61
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,280
Google cardboard um you would put your

62
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,250
you put your smartphone into landscape

63
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,260
mode and it would sort of display one

64
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,180
screen to one your left eye and one

65
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,010
other screen to your right eye and you

66
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,660
would put it inside this little like ten

67
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,140
eight dollar cardboard box with two

68
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,780
special lenses inside which are really

69
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,850
just like shiny pieces of convex glass

70
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:12,250
and you are concave glass and you would

71
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,290
all of a sudden move your head and be

72
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,900
able to see into whatever the whatever

73
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,400
the sort of the WebGL display was

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
showing you and this is really cool

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,680
because even though it wasn't sort of

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,650
like quote-unquote true VR you were you

77
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,200
were able to take a web page or people

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,670
you were also able to do this through

79
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,500
apps but a lot of web pages were

80
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,850
designed for this because it was a

81
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,320
really novel use of the gyroscope api

82
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,030
which up to this point like hadn't

83
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,150
really been used in web pages and it was

84
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,710
sort of the beginning where people were

85
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,540
talking about okay actually now like

86
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,120
mobile devices or computer desktops can

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,990
actually be used for for VR specifically

88
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,350
and VR is this this idea where you do

89
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,120
you do basically this right it's like

90
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,970
putting on a blindfold and as we're

91
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,910
gonna see VR is not the only sort of

92
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,620
like way to like change your reality but

93
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,450
if we even while so back in 2014 is sort

94
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,370
of when things were like I guess

95
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,020
starting to heat up for the second time

96
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,170
for they are so if you wanted to the

97
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,580
Google cardboard experience was really

98
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,740
nice but all you could do was three

99
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,100
degrees of freedom rotational tracking

100
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,660
and what that means basically is all you

101
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,220
could do is look left and in turn or

102
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,470
return your head around this way

103
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,900
if you moved your head in at all you the

104
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,639
the camera the view that you were seeing

105
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,650
wouldn't move with you you would need a

106
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,750
rig like this with an HTC vive or an

107
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,360
oculus rift tied to like a very you know

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,300
like three thousand dollar computer with

109
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,460
a very special graphics card in order to

110
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,990
interpret you know all the positional

111
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,849
movements all the hand movements and

112
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:58,490
order sort of keep keep up to date the

113
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,400
graphics drivers that this sort of like

114
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,949
really intensive VR system was running

115
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:06,860
and so this is still really nation days

116
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,569
for web VR but this was basically the

117
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,690
impetus for it it was that okay cool the

118
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,639
web can do you know sort of like toys

119
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,240
stuff with moving a gyroscope using your

120
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,099
smartphone but we want the web to sort

121
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:25,039
of as a platform be able to handle be

122
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,840
able to handle a sort of full scale true

123
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,240
VR and be able to expand even beyond

124
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,259
that so there are a bunch of ways to

125
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,430
sort of get started with the web via our

126
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,620
API you can go through it directly you

127
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,750
can use three J s or you can use just

128
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,659
raw WebGL if you would like but I've

129
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,340
personally always used this library

130
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,099
called a frame and so this isn't gonna

131
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:48,680
be a this talk isn't about a frame but

132
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,000
this is just a quick little demo that

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,060
sort of lets you see how accessible web

134
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,819
VR has gotten over the past few years so

135
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:58,250
I don't know if you can read this super

136
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,250
well but this little this little tag

137
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,229
here says a dash spear and it's

138
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,810
basically a custom web component that

139
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,919
the a frame library defines and you said

140
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,840
you can do stuff like a dash sphere and

141
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,580
you give it an attribute called a

142
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,560
position and it moves it in Xyz

143
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,779
coordinate space and you can even assign

144
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,469
it a color which changes it's sort of 3d

145
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:24,620
property 3d material property and you

146
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,210
can do this for a bunch of different

147
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,860
assets and you can as long as you put

148
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,139
them all in between these tags a scene

149
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,449
you get something that looks like this

150
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:35,740
so that mark up the

151
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,260
that you know eight seven or eight lines

152
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,360
that on the previous slide turned into

153
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,430
this and it's fully interactive so this

154
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,870
is an example of what it looks like on a

155
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,690
desktop you can sort of drag around and

156
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,760
move using your arrow keys but if you

157
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,680
had a computer that was hooked up to a

158
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,690
VR headset you'd be able to press a

159
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,720
button and it would automatically jump

160
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,510
into the context if you were using a VR

161
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,780
browser of your compatible browser like

162
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,010
experimental builds of Chrome or Firefox

163
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,330
you'd be able to press the button and it

164
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,340
would sort of all of a sudden be able to

165
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,080
interpret your controller movements and

166
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,810
your head movements and sort of do true

167
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,050
VR and on top of this you can it also

168
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,850
you can also see from here it like

169
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,740
degrades really gracefully to the

170
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,170
desktop if you were on a phone and you

171
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,850
had a Google cardboard with you you

172
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,610
could do Google cardboard mode but even

173
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,660
if you don't have the cardboard with you

174
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,800
you could also just use your normal

175
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,330
gyroscope and sort of wave your phone

176
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,040
around and it's it's basically it's like

177
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,230
a really weird experience for sure like

178
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,370
I'm not gonna say that it's like the

179
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,500
most optimal thing but it's really cool

180
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,620
that sort of you have a way to reach

181
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,270
everyone even if they don't have access

182
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,010
to a very expensive very nice piece of

183
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,910
VR equipment so yeah so that's sort of

184
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,790
that that work with web VR has been

185
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,480
progressing for the last few years and

186
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,310
but people were sort of hesitant browser

187
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,080
browser implementers were sort of

188
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
hesitant to implement the web via our

189
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,460
spec as it was defined because people

190
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,250
had been focusing on VR specifically and

191
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,020
everything was sort of tied to that use

192
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,090
case it assumed that there was no camera

193
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,610
input assumed that it seemed a bunch of

194
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,580
different things about position and so

195
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,790
there there's a few problems with this

196
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,790
one is that sort of mobile AR is now a

197
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,490
thing that people know about and I'm

198
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,780
basically going to give all the credit

199
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,410
for this to Pokemon go because even

200
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,880
though this wasn't the highest fidelity

201
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,720
a are people still sort of got a taste

202
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,970
of what it meant to go to you know go

203
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,310
outside of in your living room is one

204
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,930
Pokemon on the beach is a different

205
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:44,700
Pokemon

206
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,290
and sort of there's that you know

207
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,200
macro-level location-based changing but

208
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
also you could see the camera input over

209
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,800
the game input and that was that was so

210
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,180
even though there was nothing it wasn't

211
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,190
really used to great effect it sort of

212
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,980
gave people an idea that games could be

213
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,830
played spatially spatially and

214
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,560
immersively using just devices that they

215
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,300
already have which is their smartphones

216
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,360
and then on top of this using devices

217
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,420
that not everyone has the hololens was

218
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,280
officially released for its first dev

219
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,350
kit in march 2016 and the magic leap was

220
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,030
officially released just August of last

221
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,750
year for its first dev kit as well and

222
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,710
both of these are really important

223
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,710
because they're they're a are headsets

224
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,420
so in the same way that the true VR

225
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,670
headsets we're sort of the test of

226
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,360
whether or not we could do whether or

227
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,900
not we can do sort of the immersive web

228
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,410
for for VR these AR headsets

229
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,890
now give us a chance to see things like

230
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,520
a frame or 3GS or just raw WebGL running

231
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,520
in a completely transparent way over the

232
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,290
real world so things are just overlaid

233
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,590
and you can sort of see it's not like

234
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,690
putting on you know the Google cardboard

235
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,990
blinders you can actually stay in the

236
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,120
context of your living room or you know

237
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,950
go out into the real world and sort of

238
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,990
interact with it naturally but so that's

239
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,700
cool like it's cool that sort of we have

240
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,610
progressed beyond VR and that this is

241
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,340
sort of becoming feasible but as this

242
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,770
post called progressive WebEx or which

243
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,510
is on the mozilla VR blog points out

244
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,550
this is a lot of things there's a lot of

245
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,050
there's a lot of new considerations here

246
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,270
so the post so the post is called

247
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,370
progressive web excite which is sort of

248
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,650
like tagging sort of leading on in the

249
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,180
tradition of progressive enhancement

250
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,180
so whereas progressive enhancement you

251
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,040
know a upgrades or web pages

252
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,600
capabilities depending on what device

253
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,030
you're on this sort of changes the way

254
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,310
that the web page is displayed based on

255
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,090
what sort of immersive

256
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,140
our capability you can have so XR is

257
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,510
basically just like a like meta acronym

258
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,290
for AR and VR together and in its its

259
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,560
web XR because this is all we're focused

260
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,780
to just on websites but instead of just

261
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,520
having a desktop or just having a mobile

262
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,620
version now you can have a mobile AR

263
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,330
version or you can have a mobile VR

264
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,430
version or a true VR version or

265
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,320
eventually write like an AR headset

266
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,600
version and so there's a lot to keep

267
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,910
straight here and I think it's it's good

268
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,990
it's good that we're beginning to

269
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,690
develop methodologies around how to sort

270
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,300
of how to how to work around all of

271
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,050
these all of these sort of constraints

272
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,630
and out of this the web via our API

273
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,390
itself has been renamed to the WebEx our

274
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,790
device API and the working group that is

275
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,100
working on it in the w3c is now the

276
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,470
immersive web working group and they're

277
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,320
actually that's the they used to be the

278
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,110
immersive web interest group and the

279
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,190
difference between an interest and a

280
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,600
working group is that now their actual

281
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
charge is to publish a spec so that's

282
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,780
really exciting

283
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:06,890
and yeah so the the so that that's sort

284
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,210
of basically how we got to where we are

285
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,510
now right like we have that that it's

286
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,710
kind of unsatisfying right it's

287
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,360
basically I've said like there's a bunch

288
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,010
of problems and we're trying to solve

289
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,580
them but I think there's still some good

290
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,930
solutions that we've like come up with

291
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,620
so a frame is still really viable Google

292
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,480
has used it Google and Mozilla both have

293
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,190
used it for a bunch of different sort of

294
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,590
production projects you can do fancy

295
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,140
stuff like Network it you can recreate

296
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,870
you know drawing applications it's

297
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,730
really useful and really easy it's

298
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,160
designed for web designers and people

299
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,610
who sort of only know 2d JavaScript to

300
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,410
sort of get their feet wet with VR and

301
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,570
with WebGL so it's still really

302
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,210
accessible way which is and it's good to

303
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,680
see that there's so much support around

304
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,110
a VR a sort of immersive web library

305
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,380
like this Facebook has also gotten into

306
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,600
the game it used to be called react VR

307
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,670
but now it's just react 360 and it's

308
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,940
basically just a it's basically an API

309
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,630
that allows react to sort of handle and

310
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,490
gracefully

311
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,550
display 3d there sorry three yeah 3d and

312
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,720
360 video and photos so it's cool to see

313
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,190
that people are sort of building around

314
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,010
this technology and finally I think one

315
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,090
of the things that's most personally

316
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,350
exciting to me is that there's this

317
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,820
company called eighth wall that actually

318
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,970
just like launched their first thing for

319
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,750
the the spider-man release last year

320
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,450
their whole thing is like a web AR

321
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,940
marketing well ideally more applications

322
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,170
than marketing but marketing is a pretty

323
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,620
obvious one right now but yeah they so

324
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,570
this is there isn't you there's no one

325
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,700
there's no AR kit or a our core here

326
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,420
there's no sort of like on device API

327
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,760
being used it's all this is completely

328
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,300
running in Safari in the browser in a

329
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,550
normal standard browser so it's just

330
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,490
really cool to see that companies in you

331
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,900
know at the end of 2018 and sort of

332
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,460
going into 2019 are actually beginning

333
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,180
to invest in VR and they are

334
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,150
professionally and then there is some

335
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,130
also some exciting stuff sort of

336
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,200
happening already in 2019 around the

337
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,440
immersive web so the very first thing is

338
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,890
that just two days ago on February 5th

339
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,760
on Tuesday the first public draft

340
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,610
working draft of the WebEx our spec was

341
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,490
published and so what this means is that

342
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,190
basically now we're like on a track to

343
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,700
actually publishing a an actual web X

344
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,550
our spec which means it'll go to you

345
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,930
know the Safari that you know and love

346
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,530
and Firefox and Chrome and every other

347
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,140
browser and Samsung browsers and opera

348
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,780
etcetera etcetera right whatever browser

349
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,340
decides to implement it they can

350
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,770
implement it knowing that the API won't

351
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,270
all of a sudden change and you know

352
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,440
three months and then they'll have to

353
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,210
scrap a bunch of their engineering work

354
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,940
so it's really exciting to see the API

355
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,150
sort of reach maturity and along with

356
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,310
this it also means that like

357
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,530
experimental implementations that have

358
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,960
been built around the draft version of

359
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,090
the webex our API will hopefully get

360
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,540
better so there are a couple projects

361
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,610
one is from Google well there there's

362
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,650
there under two names but it's this

363
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,040
they're basically the same thing

364
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,620
fusing the Safari or the Chrome browser

365
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,420
on Android and iOS devices respectfully

366
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,199
to a 3GS session and so this really

367
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,130
gives you really really two accurate AR

368
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,259
capabilities with just a smartphone or

369
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:41,060
just an iPad as you can see in the gif

370
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,389
here and that those cubes are actually

371
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:46,430
rendered just using regular WebGL so

372
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,470
basically as long as you use this custom

373
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,329
browser you're able to sort of prototype

374
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,000
with what the webex our API could look

375
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,470
like and Mozilla has a similar effort

376
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,880
they actually published an iOS app that

377
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,370
makes this process super easy so you can

378
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,930
just make a normal web page and as long

379
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,060
as you visit it in this special little

380
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,360
iOS app or or custom compiled an Android

381
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,990
app you can sort of use regular WebGL or

382
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,500
3GS and and sort of begin to play around

383
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,810
with really experimental really sort of

384
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,670
spatial computing concepts and then yeah

385
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,529
so that's that's that's so basically all

386
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,550
that I have for the immersive web the

387
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,010
immersive web itself and I'm really

388
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,410
excited for sort of to see like to have

389
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,500
seen this like years long progression

390
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,870
into 2018 and 2019 but yeah so one last

391
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,630
thing is that I've actually just sort of

392
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,180
started a consulting business and I

393
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,980
don't actually want to have clients and

394
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,500
so basically I I'm putting this slide

395
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,480
here not for asking for work basically

396
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,589
if you're interested in the immersive

397
00:16:57,589 --> 00:16:59,480
web if you want to learn more if you

398
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,430
want to talk to me this is a good way to

399
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,280
do it and have a bunch of free time now

400
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,010
so yeah if you can either reach me here

401
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,189

internet yeah thank you

403
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,620
