00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,389

I'll turn my camera on my fingers early

2
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,750
last year I actually started looking at

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,270
all of the open-source ecosystems that

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,240
we have any kind of data on and by

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,220
ecosystem I mean people that are

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,570
publishing packages in that language

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,090
that other people can use and so you can

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,890
get some data from github but the really

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,180
good data actually just comes out of the

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,579
package managers and what I started

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,620
doing was asking certain questions of

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,379
this data then nobody was really asking

13
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,640
and people are making a lot of

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,730
assumptions about the most important one

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,010
being you know is is growth somewhat

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,110
stable and predictable can we actually

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,300
predict that growth and then if it is

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,739
predictable than what does that actually

19
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,260
tell us about how the source ecosystems

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,829
grow one thing that I did that actually

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,680
worked really well was rather than start

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,420
charting the absolute number of packages

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,510
and focusing on that I charted growth as

24
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,369
a percentage of the ecosystem as a whole

25
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,619
so you know if you had a thousand

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,020
packages and you added 100 you would

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,670
have ten percent growth and if you had

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,530
10,000 packages and you added 100 you

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,720
would have one percent growth and then

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,369
the next quarter the next time that you

31
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:21,960
measure the growth it's going to be you

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,000
know what that much harder to reach that

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,070
growth again and so what you would

34
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,229
expect is that all of the ecosystems

35
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,000
with those numbers would be coming down

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,409
right it's getting harder and harder to

37
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,210
grow at that rate and certainly some

38
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,650
open source ecosystems are dying

39
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,509
certainly some of them people are you

40
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,340
know not really that into you know like

41
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,320
come on like nobody writes Haskell that

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,340
Haskell is like dying right and but

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,590
actually what I found was was pretty

44
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,990
startling it turns out that no

45
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,240
open-source ecosystem is dying it turns

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,380
out that all of them are actually

47
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,049
growing at a pretty sustainable raid I

48
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,110
mean they do fall a little bit but over

49
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,700
a couple years you're looking at a half

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,219
to two percent right but some are

51
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,229
growing dramatically more than others

52
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,640
and that led me to disprove to like

53
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,020
really important assumptions that we've

54
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,000
been making for a long time

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,790
one was that you know these numbers were

56
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,830
unpredictable you know they are they're

57
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,580
actually very predictable this this

58
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,180
graph I took that those numbers those uh

59
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,310
basically the average growth per quarter

60
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,590
and I'm striking it out for the next

61
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,560
three years at the time so this goes to

62
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,239
the end of next year and Isaac texted me

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,910
the other day and told me that last

64
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,519
month we we went over a hundred thousand

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,500
packages and node last month and this

66
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,349
predicts it about down to the day and

67
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,000
this was made in April this graph has

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,950
made in april of last year so about a

69
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,360
year and a half afterwards it's holding

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,310
very very true so if it continues to

71
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,170
hold true for about a year we're going

72
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,160
to be you know close to 300,000 packages

73
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,329
we're going to be double the size of

74
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:05,480
Ruby that's that's pretty tremendous but

75
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,590
the other more important assumption that

76
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,620
this totally destroyed was that um oh

77
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,750
the growth of one ecosystem is at the

78
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,819
expense of another that when note grows

79
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,920
it's because people are ditching Python

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,569
and they're ditching Ruby and you know

81
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,730
there or you know when go is growing

82
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,840
it's because people are jumping ship

83
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,579
from node because you know TJ wrote a

84
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,239
blog post and this is actually not true

85
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,670
it turns out that open source ecosystem

86
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,160
growth almost entirely comes from what

87
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,139
you could call non-consumption right so

88
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,760
that's non consumption in terms of

89
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,049
people that are writing code and not

90
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,389
publishing open source packages so if

91
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,519
you make it easier and you have a

92
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,349
culture of participation where people

93
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:43,910
want to publish and they're incentivize

94
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,859
to publish then they will so you get a

95
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,510
lot of growth out of that and then you

96
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,459
also get a lot of growth out of what you

97
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,590
could call a mature ization so taking a

98
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,359
task that used to be only accessible to

99
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,549
a couple really smart programmers that

100
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:57,139
knew how like b-trees worked and

101
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,120
stuff and then you make it super simple

102
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,010
and easy for almost anybody to use

103
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,510
including you know high school dropouts

104
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,519
and then you know they make awesome

105
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,200
websites with it and really creative

106
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,400
stuff that people who know how b-trees

107
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,489
work could never do and and so like

108
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,630
that's that's really important because

109
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,130
if you're trying to grow an ecosystem

110
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,269
you need to learn these lessons about

111
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,729
how things actually grow so I was paying

112
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,280
attention to this graph for a long time

113
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,570
containing attention to the massive

114
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,000
growth of node you know now we are by

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,650
far the largest ecosystem

116
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,780
in the world we're still the fastest

117
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,820
growing ecosystem in the world although

118
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,240
packages being bringing PHP up there so

119
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,600
PHP is having another growth spurt again

120
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,630
no mumbles it's still okay I think stuff

121
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,979
all right but what I wasn't paying

122
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,380
attention to with until recently was

123
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,979
this graph this is the contributions to

124
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,850
node core graph and it is decidedly not

125
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,910
growing you know you can see that over

126
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,800
the last couple years we've had sort of

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,949
a smaller decline and then last year a

128
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,350
pretty huge decline in the last looks

129
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,840
like two or three months we're getting

130
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,380
pretty close to zero and considering

131
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,660
that we have the largest ecosystem in

132
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,520
the world we have you know we're the

133
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,990
fastest growing use in the world there

134
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,430
are a lot of incentives for people to

135
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,830
want to contribute to node and they're

136
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,349
not there they are decidedly not

137
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:21,320
contributing to it and this is this is

138
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,940
about the problem but also you know like

139
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,880
why you know we have this great project

140
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,949
people are clearly using it why aren't

141
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:30,380
people could have been decorum another

142
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,970
more concerning even more concerning

143
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,680
graph is this one this is the number of

144
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,110
stable releases per year of node so you

145
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,430
can see that even all the way through

146
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,320
2013 we're doing a lot of stable

147
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,909
releases I mean this includes patch

148
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,250
releases right so bug fixes and security

149
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,289
fixes and that kind of stuff and then

150
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:47,300
this year we have just this huge decline

151
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,430
I mean there's a month left of this year

152
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,669
but it's not going up much and you know

153
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,039
we we had two huge security problems

154
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,930
this year right like two huge security

155
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,940
like SSL fixes that had to go out so

156
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,070
that's you know two of these seven or

157
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,680
eight releases so we're also not

158
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,240
releasing so the code that is getting in

159
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,539
we're not getting it out the door people

160
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,010
are starting to kind of wonder like what

161
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,300
the hell is going on with this project

162
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,639
and you know if I were to show you the

163
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,949
NPM update graph which is the number of

164
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:20,599
updates to packages so not just new

165
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,010
publishes like we saw in the previous

166
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,780
graph but also people continuing to

167
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,460
maintain an update packages it actually

168
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,169
see that that growth that graph grows

169
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,690
even faster than the number of packages

170
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,940
like new packages published so you know

171
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,580
updates to things and continuing stable

172
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,729
releases inside of the eCos

173
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,069
is growing tremendously and then it's

174
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,550
not happening in code core so if we want

175
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,949
to fix this we have to figure out what

176
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:46,409
works what is working in the ecosystem

177
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:49,020
that we're all participating in that's

178
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,849
growing like crazy that now has you know

179
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,879
100,000 modules and what parts of that

180
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,729
are not true for core and let's make

181
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:57,809
them true for it so that we can

182
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:00,599
potentially fix this so this is a

183
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,479
visualization a simple simplified

184
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,539
visualization of the level up ecosystem

185
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:10,199
and there's a lot of other ecosystems

186
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,839
inside of NPM that look a lot like this

187
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,240
right you could look at some of the

188
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,469
stuff to McCullough sheng co does with

189
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,759
ndarray and it would look a lot like

190
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,550
this as well where you have sort of

191
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,539
layers of different modules that

192
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:22,949
accomplish different tasks and then they

193
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,330
sort of have these different dependency

194
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,839
chains on top of them and in a lot of

195
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,309
cases actually there is this sort of

196
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:31,319
linchpin module the module that sort of

197
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,029
like is at the center of this little

198
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:36,539
ecosystem and when you when you really

199
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,939
break down npm where you find are lots

200
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,409
of different clusters of things and

201
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,759
sometimes they're around something like

202
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,990
level up but sometimes they're just

203
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,270
around a person right like you know some

204
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,399
stack and dominic tar and max ogden like

205
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,749
they they have a bunch of modules that

206
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:50,610
they use together in certain ways really

207
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,259
often and they form this little sort of

208
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,439
ecosystem but there's a few things you

209
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,149
need to know about this right like one

210
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:00,449
is that all of these independent modules

211
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,209
are run by different people there's a

212
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,279
certain amount of ownership that goes

213
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,319
along with these smaller kind of single

214
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,459
maintainer modules and they they're

215
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,990
basically able to operate completely

216
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,399
independent of each other so nobody's

217
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,479
anybody's boss nobody owns anybody else

218
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,550
and the only time that that isn't really

219
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,959
the case is in this level up module

220
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,270
right level up actually is in a similar

221
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,919
position to what you can call a node

222
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,089
core is right like a lot of people

223
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,479
depend on it on both sides of the stack

224
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,870
and so it should exhibit a lot of the

225
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,120
same problems the core does but it

226
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,469
actually doesn't so this is a really

227
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:39,180
good thing to look at and to try and

228
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,349
figure out you know ways that we might

229
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,870
improve note in the future so this is

230
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,750
rod bag rod is the creator of level up

231
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,740
and is still one of the the prime

232
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,240
maintain errs a really great guy great

233
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,850
addition to the note community you'll

234
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,260
see his name pop up a lot the more that

235
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,899
you get into things but Rob decided to

236
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:01,089
run the project very very differently

237
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,620
than we've seen a lot of open source

238
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,589
project from before any key came up with

239
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:07,750
this new system that he called open open

240
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,760
source I don't think that the acronym

241
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,779
actually means anything he just

242
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,580
capitalizes it to reinforce the fact

243
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,380
that his open open source open

244
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,060
up this is the first line of the

245
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,730
contributing file for for it and that

246
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,170
this is the description of open open

247
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,060
source which is that at individuals

248
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,080
making significant and valuable

249
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,820
contributions are given commit access to

250
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,140
the project to contribute as they see

251
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,200
fit this project is more like an open

252
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
wiki than a standard guarded open source

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,320
project so it turns out that get is like

254
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920
really good at removing mistakes you

255
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,630
can't screw up get the way that you can

256
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,160
screw up like a subversion repository

257
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,470
and a lot of these crazy kind of

258
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,240
safeguards and hierarchies that we have

259
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,589
around giving people commit access

260
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,180
they're really not that warranted

261
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,070
anymore when we can revert things so

262
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,260
simply and easily right like we may want

263
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,450
to guard the keys to doing releases and

264
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,640
pushing releases to NPM but in terms of

265
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
like actually guarding commit access

266
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,290
that's not all that necessary and so he

267
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,420
sort of figured this out he added this

268
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,610
to the project he started just giving

269
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,350
commitment to anybody that sent a patch

270
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,970
that was more than four or five lines

271
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,240
long and what ended up happening was a

272
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,180
lot of people including me dominic tar

273
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,149
and Palo Fragomeni and all of the people

274
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,430
that sort of depend on level up on every

275
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,860
side of this ecosystem they all got

276
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,570
commit access and they all had a shared

277
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,130
sense of responsibility for the project

278
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,600
and it's it's easy to con somebody into

279
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,649
having a shared sense of responsibility

280
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:37,899
for some time you know you can say like

281
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,010
oh you know I really believe in you

282
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,779
write this stuff and then but if you

283
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,640
don't give them ownership over it if you

284
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,670
don't like if you don't treat the if you

285
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,470
don't act as a participant yourself if

286
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,240
you don't come with a pull request just

287
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,470
like everybody else and you sort of

288
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,390
continue to act like a dictator people

289
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,800
start to understand that they actually

290
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,170
don't have any ownership over this and

291
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,180
their participation will go down a lot

292
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,560
and their sense of responsibility over

293
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,779
the project will go down quite a bit and

294
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:03,760
and for the people that don't do that

295
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,410
they'll just burn themselves out I mean

296
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,480
look though they'll get so care mad

297
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,310
about everything that happens and

298
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,570
they'll sort of flip out and it's all

299
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,670
because they they feel a lack of control

300
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,270
over their own work and this model that

301
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,890
rod came up with has been hugely

302
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,149
successful in avoiding all these

303
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,620
pitfalls you know there's a heap there's

304
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,420
an amazing active and engaged community

305
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,690
that shares ownership over the project

306
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,250
and it's it maintained very very

307
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,500
responsibly without you know all these

308
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,970
crazy safeguards that we sort of obsess

309
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,770
over okay so um can talk a little bit

310
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,260
about notes cool so a lot of people have

311
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,820
been doing notes cool we there was one

312
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,890
here people talked about new schools lot

313
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,630
notes cool it really sort of came out of

314
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,459
out of the out of the note conferences

315
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:53,380
so note comp 2012 sub stack wrote this

316
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,350
little stream adventure workshop room in

317
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,839
fact we heard for that year I decided

318
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,370
that note comp was just going to be all

319
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,380
hands on and so most people just

320
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,270
collaborated on building slides in a

321
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,520
whole curriculum and sub-sect tried to

322
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,170
do that for about five minutes before he

323
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,839
flipped out and was like screw this no

324
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,670
and like and then he's like I'm just

325
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,290
going to run a module and so he writes

326
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,790
this module that's you know an

327
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,820
interactive workshop that was by far the

328
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,700
best workshop that year everybody really

329
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,339
loved it to moxley love the rod bag

330
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:26,529
loved it so much that when he went to to

331
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,860
moxies conference camp j/s a few months

332
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,040
later he he rewrote all of his workshop

333
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,100
materials in a very similar format so

334
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,910
that you could have this sort of

335
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,920
interactive presentation style and then

336
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,750
a few months later at node comfy you

337
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,980
there's you know five of these

338
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,140
interactive workshops and we put them

339
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,730
all under this banner and call it note

340
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,000
school and it really took off from there

341
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,190
and then shortly after that i created

342
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,020
this issue and this is like my favorite

343
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,300
github issue in the history of open

344
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,540
source it's so great so like I just sort

345
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,070
of put together resources for people

346
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,190
running localized node schools in their

347
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,279
town or whatever

348
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,990
and I said you know hey run one you know

349
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,910
when you're done like totally come back

350
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,339
and tell us all about it and so and this

351
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,339
thread just blew up for months so tons

352
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,870
of people were running these they were

353
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,370
coming back and saying what worked and

354
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,050
what didn't work we were all inter ating

355
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,360
on how we did them and you know people

356
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,589
started sending in all these awesome

357
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,510
photos and attaching them to the issue

358
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,240
as well so you know these are from and

359
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,769
these are from all over the world I mean

360
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:31,320
you know you got London and China and

361
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,079
Australia I think there's a little bit

362
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,779
of San Francisco in there Columbia like

363
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,329
they've met een Columbia's in there and

364
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:40,500
this is all happening within like the

365
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,320
first few months and we were so excited

366
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,690
that we we kind of didn't notice when

367
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,750
growth kind of plateaued like we had a

368
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,610
bunch of new people come and run them

369
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,010
and then we we basically exhausted I

370
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,420
guess the number of people that could

371
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,190
just figure this out from that issue and

372
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,200
it stagnated for a little while and then

373
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,390
you know max Ogden who you may have seen

374
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,959
earlier he decided that he was going to

375
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,670
sort of like take on some more

376
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,200
leadership and organize things a bit and

377
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,000
what he did was one he just documented

378
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,790
very very well how to run a note school

379
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,860
you know you don't need it any money you

380
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,360
don't need to pay for pizza and beer

381
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,850
unless you want to like just you know

382
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,290
it's very very simple you know here are

383
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,740
these materials that's it but then he he

384
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,980
found a way to adopt to adapt rod begs

385
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,529
open open source to this like new

386
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:33,839
growing community of note schools

387
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,950
because one of the problems that you

388
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,779
have in distributing this project is

389
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:37,860
like well how do you share ownership

390
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,740
over something that is literally global

391
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,149
and people are running them in their

392
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,760
local acts in their local community so

393
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,200
you created this note school github org

394
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,050
and basically anybody who comes along

395
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,790
and says I want to run a new node school

396
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,709
they get added as an owner of the entire

397
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,230
org and then from there they create a

398
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,510
repo for their local node school chapter

399
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,250
which you know means that they get a

400
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,250
website and and also that github repo

401
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,050
ends up being an issue tracker for them

402
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,180
to organize the event and for anybody

403
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,820
that was at the event to follow up later

404
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,320
and then then he did something just

405
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,380
 genius he he told them that at

406
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,240
genius he he told them that at
the end of every node school they should

407
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,740
get the github handles of everybody who

408
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,340
attended

409
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,140
and add them as an owner of the

410
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,360
individual repository so now they're all

411
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,160
watching the repo they're all following

412
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,160
up and it makes this line between I just

413
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,570
learn node I know a little bit more

414
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,280
about node now I'm helping out to run a

415
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,650
node school now I'm entering it makes

416
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,480
that continuum and that transition so

417
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,510
simple and easy and it ended again it

418
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,750
shares ownership of the localized event

419
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,520
which means that people have a shared

420
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,990
sense of responsibility for keeping it

421
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,940
running it's really genius there's

422
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,370
worked incredibly well and now we're i'm

423
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,320
on the owners thread so I know about

424
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,730
every single one that comes in and it's

425
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,230
like two or three a week or being added

426
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,180
it's crazy and then you know I have to

427
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,770
unsubscribe from this repo because it's

428
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:00,720
like all in Japanese and and and and

429
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,270
just recently you know Max's been on a

430
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,560
kick of trying to get everybody to

431
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,570
translate as well so there's a ton of

432
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,940
translations for the node school website

433
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,530
trying to translate all the work

434
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,120
shoppers there's a new concerted effort

435
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,500
to try and distribute ownership of that

436
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,070
as well it's going really really well

437
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,590
another thing max put together in in

438
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,150
Oakland the the hometown of node is

439
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,530
Oakland Jas so the reason I bring this

440
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,150
up is that you know there's everybody's

441
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,160
been to a meetup probably meet it's very

442
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,080
common Oakland Jace is just a little bit

443
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,450
different it's not a thing where people

444
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,270
go and talk or pitch there's no speak

445
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,390
there's no speakers at all we we have it

446
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,790
at the sort of the outdoor beer garden

447
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,500
and it's just a place for people to come

448
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,660
and relax and sort of continued to build

449
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,700
a community over a long period of time

450
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,950
and the secret to its success is that we

451
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,100
do it every week and so nobody is there

452
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,260
every time nobody is even in charge of

453
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,880
making it happen it just happens every

454
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,380
week and people just show up every week

455
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,150
and you don't have to feel weird about

456
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,250
not showing up or showing up again but

457
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,810
one thing that this is started to do is

458
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,940
that for the first time we're attracting

459
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,310
a lot of non-programmers into

460
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,850
programming into this local community um

461
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,650
because one thing that we we found out

462
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,290
through the note schools is that people

463
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,410
if people can reach out to someone that

464
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,080
they've met they're far more likely to

465
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,400
follow up if they're really new to

466
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,110
programming there's certain things that

467
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,439
are just terrifying to ask online

468
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,320
in fact one thing that the local node

469
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,029
school chapter started doing that I've

470
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:33,710
been stealing really liberally is that

471
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,299
they started creating get er chat rooms

472
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:37,820
for their local node school and at first

473
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,250
I was like why like if people want help

474
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,529
they should just go to like a main node

475
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,600
school one but no it's actually done

476
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,879
really well because people who will go

477
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,500
to these local event they'll have a

478
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,850
question and they'll just be terrified

479
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,259
to ask it if anybody except the people

480
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:53,509
that they just met at that meet up and

481
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,940
so having sort of like you know weekly

482
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,129
informals and having you know these

483
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:00,620
localized support systems really help us

484
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,360
bring in what will eventually be the

485
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,860
next generation of new programmers write

486
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,899
like these are these are possibly people

487
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:07,039
that aren't going to be full-time

488
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,750
programmers you know they're going to

489
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,250
work instead of government and they need

490
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,720
to process some data and they want to

491
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,250
know how to do that in a way that works

492
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,110
on the web or you know they work in

493
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,580
education and so they have an interest

494
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,750
in this and it's going to help them do

495
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,730
their job but you know they're not going

496
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,980
to work at a startup and that's

497
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,090
great because we don't need more

498
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,340
startups but we need or more where

499
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,019
people writing useful so but uh

500
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,029
yeah so like these these are all just

501
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,009
great day and like here's a couple more

502
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:37,909
photos from from our local Oakland Jas

503
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,399
and you know literally like we don't

504
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:41,929
even have the same table each week

505
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,370
because we don't have a reserve space so

506
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,049
people just have to kind of look around

507
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,580
and try to figure out like where laptops

508
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,759
are and then it's like oh hey you are

509
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,289
and I started bringing like those little

510
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:52,490
bits and now we're playing with those

511
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,320
all the time but it's just been really

512
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,769
fun and we noticed people coming back

513
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,210
week after week that just would never

514
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,370
come to a meet up and we're really

515
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,070
pulling them into this into this

516
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,710
community and we never would have been

517
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,120
able to get them any other way so I

518
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,700
highly suggest doing something like this

519
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,500
but ok so the future right this is

520
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,789
future town so what what is the future

521
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:21,889
of node look like that's what the talk

522
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:23,059
is supposed to be about so I better

523
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:25,070
bring back around so the future of note

524
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,580
is it's actually you in that you know

525
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,669
node is a participatory culture

526
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,899
everything that we've succeeded at we've

527
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,730
succeeded at because we have a brita

528
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,470
saboteur II culture and because we've

529
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,299
been amateur izing these these tasks and

530
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:39,710
now we have to move on to the next phase

531
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,400
of that which means like all of

532
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,680
you need to participate and all of you

533
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,750
need to to get involved in ways that you

534
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,540
know we have some examples of before but

535
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,040
you know we need to find new ways to

536
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,540
collaborate in new ways to get involved

537
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,990
so the first izle is you know local like

538
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,480
if you don't have a community in your

539
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,460
town you can build one if you do have a

540
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,530
little one you can grow it you can make

541
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,330
it more cohesive and it's really not

542
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,610
that hard and there's now a lot more

543
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,950
resources so you can run a note school

544
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,290
there's incredibly detailed information

545
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,600
on how to run a note school I mean

546
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,310
literally you know dozens of people are

547
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,010
running them every month you know all of

548
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,750
the workshop or materials are there for

549
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,880
you to use it's it's a really and it's a

550
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,650
really great experience to be a mentor

551
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,910
and to teach people things you'll

552
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,830
actually learn a lot by teaching other

553
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,670
people if you if you if you know you

554
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,170
have a bit more of a community you want

555
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,730
to bring in some you know out of town

556
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,650
speakers and really get people in your

557
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,260
city or town excited about about note

558
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,990
and about JavaScript I started doing

559
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,340
this thing called node cough one shot

560
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,880
and I liberally stole from what max did

561
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,670
with notes cool and essentially

562
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,650
documented how to run a very simple very

563
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,750
stripped down one day conference it

564
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,190
doesn't cost a lot of money it's not

565
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,020
that hard there's instructions on there

566
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,910
on how to do a really great CFP and how

567
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,860
to select good talks like you know

568
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,950
really anybody can run these we were

569
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,530
going to do four of them this year

570
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,580
there's you know already two on the

571
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,450
books for next year so really if if you

572
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,710
feel like you want to step it up another

573
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:15,060
notch check out one shot okay and then

574
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,800
there's no forward which everybody's

575
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,730
probably been waiting for me to talk

576
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:23,940
about so so note forward it's to get up

577
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,640
work that I created and a campaign that

578
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,230
a lot of people are now involved in

579
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,000
where we're really just trying to get no

580
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,190
decor back on track and not just knowed

581
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,620
core but we're trying to solve a lot of

582
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,090
the problems inside of the note

583
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,710
community and ecosystems that aren't

584
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,020
solvable with just one module right they

585
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,150
do require the collaboration of more

586
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,710
people inside of the ecosystem and so

587
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,580
some some great examples of this are

588
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,740
onboarding so new people come to

589
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,730
JavaScript and no

590
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,710
and they land at API Docs and you can't

591
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,450
learn if you don't know anything

592
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,400
about note already it just by looking at

593
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,410
API Docs and there are a lot of great

594
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,840
resources that people have built for for

595
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,130
learning JavaScript and for learning

596
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,440
note I mean max Ogden wrote this amazing

597
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,660
one called jazz for cats that is

598
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,670
literally you know a cat's guide to

599
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,630
learning JavaScript it's adorable and

600
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,680
you know there's you know a node.js

601
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,090
handbook and there's all these great

602
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,760
resources there's even knowed school but

603
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,050
finding them and seeing them laid out in

604
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,700
a cohesive way that says you know I

605
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,530
would want to go and do this really

606
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,920
isn't there so Tracy Abrams and a bunch

607
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,840
of other people are leading this really

608
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,760
great effort to sort of consolidate some

609
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,960
of this material and build a website

610
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,970
that is basically a landing page for new

611
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,740
node users that we can start pointing

612
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,370
people at and you know if you're into

613
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,230
documentation you're into usability you

614
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,520
know how to make pretty websites like

615
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,680
you can help out with this so just go to

616
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,400
this repo and pitch in the next is help

617
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,170
so I don't know if you've ever been on

618
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,090
the node.js mailing list but is it's a

619
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,570
cesspool it's just it's the worst don't

620
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,310
go there just don't unless you want to

621
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:06,390
know a lot about fibers it's so but and

622
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,040
but people like legitimately show up

623
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,330
with real questions and they're like

624
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,550
help me and then they'll learn about

625
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,450
fibers instead and so we've been trying

626
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,130
to fix this for a long time I mean for

627
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,120
snowmobiles done a great job of

628
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,410
moderating the mailing list but it's

629
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,030
still just not like a super accessible

630
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,860
thing so we created a github repo and

631
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,570
we're using the issue track you tracker

632
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,820
there for people to ask questions and

633
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,770
help but we also actually have a git er

634
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,950
room because we vet we've found that get

635
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,990
er just being on the web and being

636
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,340
simple we're getting people that won't

637
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,940
pop into IRC very simply very easily so

638
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,740
if you want to help people you know you

639
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,690
can you can watch this repo to provide

640
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,090
help for people you can pop into that

641
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,660
Gator channel and help any new users out

642
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,220
we're already getting a pretty good

643
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,820
amount of people come popping in and

644
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,960
forest is sort of leading that project

645
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,500
along with some other people next one is

646
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,580
one that I'm getting pretty excited

647
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,810
about because we've been talking about

648
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,830
it forever but it's

649
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,450
always kind of stalled out and I got

650
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,399
anywhere but now it's really happening

651
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:10,710
which is basically a sort of like global

652
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,640
open-source mentorship program so

653
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,809
essentially the idea is that you know a

654
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:17,519
mentor signs up and says you know I know

655
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,230
about this kind of stuff I can dedicate

656
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,419
about these many hours a week to helping

657
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,130
out a new person and then they get on

658
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,779
you know Google hangout or a skype or

659
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:26,100
whatever with new people that come along

660
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,159
that want to learn more and one we sort

661
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,200
of like build a lot better relationships

662
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,730
with newer people and pull them into the

663
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,460
community like really deeply and also

664
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,500
it's just a good educational effort so

665
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,860
right now you can go to that repo and

666
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,590
then the readme has a list of mentors

667
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,480
and if you're up for mentoring then just

668
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,750
send a pull request and add yourself and

669
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,000
that's a great way that you can help out

670
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,010
then there's some core stuff so we have

671
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,019
we have a discussions repo for any other

672
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:00,000
problems that I haven't talked about or

673
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,289
any new issues there's already some

674
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:02,789
threads there that are there barring

675
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:05,519
some fruit one is the the first one that

676
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,409
I added to the repo which is called all

677
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:10,590
the maths but essentially I don't know

678
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,779
if you know this but are and sigh pie

679
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:14,250
and all of these like crazy math

680
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,659
libraries that I had mex talk about

681
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,580
they're basically just fortran code it's

682
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,559
just fortran code that they bind to and

683
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,880
these four trim libraries are fine

684
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,539
ancient and i was like hey can we cross

685
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:25,940
compile this like can we do something

686
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,200
how do we fix this and so we had a long

687
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,970
discussion about it and just recently

688
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,220
because nobody could get em script in

689
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,929
with fortran support to install like sup

690
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:35,850
one person he made a docker image for it

691
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,889
so now anybody can run this docker image

692
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:40,919
and he actually cross compiled all of

693
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,289
these ancient for like a la pack the

694
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:46,710
this fortran mega library with M

695
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,309
scripting and and yeah so any other

696
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:51,600
problems that you think you know the

697
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,980
noted community needs to address you

698
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,840
should bring up there it's also a really

699
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,399
nice repo to just watch and participate

700
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:00,480
in another one which is also being run

701
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,830
by rod bag is build so the the current

702
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,309
build system for core is I think it

703
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:09,899
might just be down or it's just not

704
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:11,190
running or whatever but it's really not

705
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,559
that reliable so one we want like a

706
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,299
better automated build system for core

707
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,850
that runs all the tests we want to get

708
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,480
like you know

709
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,490
formas tests running we want to also

710
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,770
when for every build of core we should

711
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,840
really be running like the npm tests and

712
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,830
we should really be running like the

713
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,660
tests of the most popular modules out

714
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,460
there so we know that we're not breaking

715
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,440
something on top of node not just note

716
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,130
itself and so and another thing is that

717
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,510
we want it to be really robust right

718
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,100
like right right now it's all on like

719
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,290
one providers infrastructure and that's

720
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,230
just not going to hold up so like almost

721
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,900
a dozen companies now have like given

722
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,370
resources to this you know I gave some

723
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,530
digital ocean but you know voxer went

724
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,970
and bought like Mac minis and put them

725
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,040
in a data center for Mac testing you

726
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,660
know we're getting like freebsd stuff in

727
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,880
there IBM and soft layer through and

728
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,200
some resources so we're getting a lot of

729
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,780
people into this right now it's um what

730
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,970
is that awful Java thing some awful Java

731
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:10,020
Sea I but rod can't use anything in Java

732
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,970
for long too long before he regrets it

733
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,160
and node so there's there's also an

734
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,640
up-and-coming CI utility written a node

735
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,840
that will be probably switching to at

736
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,090
some point so you can go to that repo

737
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,590
and pitch in if you're like a build

738
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:28,380
person the roadmap so it's been a

739
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,059
complaint for as long as I've been

740
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:33,630
working on node stuff that core is a

741
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,760
very homogeneous group of people and

742
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,710
this because like you know to work on

743
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,240
core most of the people especially the

744
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,650
people that came early on came from kind

745
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,910
of server backgrounds and formerly

746
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,280
low-level backgrounds and if you look at

747
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,900
the growth like more than half of no

748
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,390
juice issues in front and tooling and so

749
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,220
getting that feedback into the core

750
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,740
group has been very difficult and it's

751
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,210
been locked up in a lot of weird process

752
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,280
so we have this roadmap repo where we're

753
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,110
sort of like asking questions and coming

754
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,429
up with more creative ways of getting

755
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,230
feedback from people so we can try to

756
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,030
figure out what are the biggest issues

757
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,710
that did people need addressed in core

758
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,049
so we can feed that into an eventual

759
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:09,240
roadmap right but the the purpose of the

760
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,530
project now and there's a couple threads

761
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,390
on there you can participate in which is

762
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,210
about figuring out what the biggest pain

763
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,370
points are in node from every different

764
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,250
part of the community so we can get all

765
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,770
that consolidated and the last one which

766
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,510
is not actually on node forward but it's

767
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,669
very important it's called man worst

768
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:30,929
name ever rod but so if you use any like

769
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:31,880
see live

770
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,170
every major release of node they break

771
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,960
because v8 dramatically changes its API

772
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,900
during every release and so what we're

773
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,760
trying to do with nan does basically it

774
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,040
provides like enough surface area for

775
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,490
most people to bind to that are doing

776
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,810
like a native extension or a sea

777
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,570
extension and it straddles the different

778
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,710
versions of v8 that are in major

779
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,260
releases of node and it's sort of like

780
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,430
you know constantly getting like

781
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,740
refactored and and there's a lot of work

782
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,840
going into it right now but what we're

783
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,490
hoping is that this kind of eventually

784
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,890
become the unofficial sort of blessed

785
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,560
way for you to do native add-ons if you

786
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,930
can there's always going to be a section

787
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,760
of the native like parts of native add

788
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,200
on that you may need to bind directly to

789
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,640
v8 but the more that you can use this

790
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,080
the less pain that you'll go through

791
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,390
during every major release of node and

792
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,100
the less pain that you know everybody

793
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,370
who uses your module will go through so

794
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,740
that's sort of the summary of the the

795
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,040
current work that's me I'm Michael

796
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,350
Rogers and when I'm not running node

797
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,140
events I'm the director of evangelism a

798
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:41,230
digital ocean thank you
