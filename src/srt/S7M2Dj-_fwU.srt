00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,970
great awesome thank you Justin for

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,890
introducing me my name is Alex Castilla

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,779
I'm a software engineer in Netflix but

5
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,900
today I'm here to talk to you about my

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:38,280
side project so I build software to

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,670
understand human behavior and one of the

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,570
sources that I based my research on is

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,079
electricity the human body is an ocean

10
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,170
of electricity everything we do is

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,469
controlled and facilitated by electrical

12
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,190
signals are running through our bodies

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,160
well today I'm very excited to tell you

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,519
that we're going to use JavaScript to

15
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,650
witness some of these electricity in

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,799
real time but before I proceed I will

17
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,740
actually like to get a volunteer that is

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,530
going to join me on stage and it's going

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,040
to wear the nerdy hat anyone up for the

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
challenges raise your hands I have one

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,350
here two here I see someone jump in

22
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,030

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,930
right please come here

27
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,900
take a seat and I'm just going to put

28
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,760
this on your head did you look like you

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,290
don't have a huge head which is a great

30
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,260
thing because sometimes this doesn't

31
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,690
feed and people have to you know exit

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:08,720
but electrocute you we'll get to that

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,380
part yeah

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,600
you scare me man all right so you're

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,590
gonna feel a little bit of spikes but we

36
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,230
actually want that because those are the

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,030
electrodes are going to make contact

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,800
with your head make sure if it heard

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,090
just let me know it shouldn't but yeah

40
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,900
you do have a good head for this headset

41
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,620
god bless your parents so I'm going to

42
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,319
put this your lobes here that is just so

43
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,440
your head doesn't explode so just okay

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,959
I'm going to turn it on if you can just

45
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,880
stand up real quick and turn around so

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,670
they can see that it's on just turn

47
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,579
around you're gonna see a blue light

48
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:07,579
take a seat relax and and just so we're

49
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:10,640
clear I'm gonna have pseudo access to

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,250
your brain just relax

51
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,510
and don't think of anything

52
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,750
inappropriate all right all right if

53
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,400
you're not the guy for this just let me

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,989
know how we can save you the

55
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,590
embarrassment all right and I hope you

56
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,299
got some time to read the fine print in

57
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:33,739
here it's not yeah all right so I'm

58
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:40,040
gonna take what is going to capture the

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,900
signals from the hats and I'm just gonna

60
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,740
plug it into my computer

61
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,750
good I'm gonna exit my slice and just

62
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:58,460
start running node all right so I'm just

63
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,810
gonna run and no doubt that I'm gonna

64
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,030
walk you through a little later but what

65
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:13,700
we want is to visualize it's just gonna

66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,690
take a few seconds it's gonna enter your

67
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,970
brain and we should start seeing

68
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,400
something real real soon if you have

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,800
something on your head

70
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,250
all right of course

71
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,110
I should have turned these on after that

72
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,950
so let me just fix it real quick all

73
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,470
right there you go are you comfortable

74
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,000
there

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,170
awesome I'm gonna give this one more try

76
00:04:50,180 --> 00:05:00,470
oh there must be something wrong with

77
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,690
you man

78
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,610
exception yeah for sure there's

79
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,590
something completely wrong with you

80
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,030
I'm gonna try to fix something here and

81
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,759
see are you thinking of something

82
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,770
inappropriate right now that would do it

83
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:23,380
for sure oh no man yeah yeah

84
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:30,370
this is this is not great I have to kill

85
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:40,820
the process it's your name process

86
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,809
I'm not running anything else let's give

87
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:44,559
this another try

88
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,709
otherwise I'll have to kill the process

89
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:51,339
okay I'll have to what is the command

90
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:56,229
again kill or no - nine

91
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:25,350
now kill oh yeah

92
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,220
okay this is embarrassing part when I'm

93
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,260
going to go to stack overflow you know

94
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:41,970
you all do this right you all do this I

95
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,350
don't know how many times I've had to do

96
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,450
this before

97
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:54,230
all right I knew we had a nine I knew

98
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,950
had a nine

99
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,220
there you go up what I don't have is a

100
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:07,230
PID and I have to do a grab first yeah

101
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:16,860
no you're making this very difficult

102
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:31,500
11:07 fifty which one Jesus where is it

103
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:48,060
kill and the PID is 1050

104
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,380
[Music]

105
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,780
thank you thank you for your patience

106
00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:02,949
but that didn't work I'm gonna give this

107
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,800
another try

108
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,520
although what is it gonna have to be

109
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:31,329
honest with us again yeah

110
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:38,889
well I give me one second of this one

111
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:45,480
second I try this one off plug this one

112
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,360
in turn this one on again

113
00:08:48,360 --> 00:09:06,199
oh no comment oh there you go

114
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:08,480
thank you guys you do have something

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,550
great thank you for your patience is not

116
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,050
easy interacting with the human brain

117
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,360
with JavaScript alright so what we have

118
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,959
in here I'll walk you through but first

119
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,180
let's just see the fun stuff right and

120
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,199
let's start by checking out some actual

121
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:31,230
brain waves all right we are getting

122
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,350
some signals in here what I do see is

123
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,089
that there are some channels that are

124
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:38,910
not making contact with the scalp that

125
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,370
will be channel 1 2 3 4 5 5 & 6 okay so

126
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,449
I think this one here there you don't

127
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:55,170
move okay this relax if that one doesn't

128
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:55,800
work

129
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,630
it could mean you have nothing in this

130
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:13,889
area I'm just being honest here is it a

131
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:15,389
little tight I think it's that I think

132
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,819
this is just way too tight that means

133
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:19,949
you have probably a whitehead there's

134
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:21,990
nothing wrong with that though can you

135
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:29,259
feel that all right we have one

136
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:40,199
there you go now

137
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:43,269
one two three one two three this one

138
00:10:43,269 --> 00:11:01,230
here almost almost almost

139
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,680
all right I think we can proceed with

140
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:10,450
what we have

141
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,320
don't shut down that part of your head

142
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,529
just you know it's just think of

143
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:19,700
beautiful things all right we'll work

144
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,880
with those seven okay all right so this

145
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,690
is some of the brainwaves visualized in

146
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,250
what we call a time series all the

147
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,150
contract is it's not great in here but

148
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,279
what you're seeing is the electrical

149
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,110
signals being captured by the headset

150
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,830
and being displayed in a web browser and

151
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,210
for a second time I'm going to show you

152
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:49,310
different ways we can visualize this if

153
00:11:49,310 --> 00:12:11,630
my window would just all right fine

154
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:18,340
or right right

155
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,610
so I'm going to stop it and run in one

156
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:44,890
more time

157
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,510
with your server ok I think I have to

158
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,180
the trick of stopping again the process

159
00:12:52,180 --> 00:13:04,670
to 1015 1172 it's okay

160
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,470
right this is good foot before it for

161
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,209
now I'm gonna stop here and I want to

162
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:10,559
walk you through what just happened okay

163
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,170
so please give it up for our volunteer

164
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,610
here thank you

165
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:24,629
yeah wait careful right thank you so

166
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:25,980
much fun thank you we really appreciate

167
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,220
it

168
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,660
all right okay so what just happened

169
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,819
here

170
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:36,029
this is what I called New York

171
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:38,910
JavaScript and what is New York

172
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,059
JavaScript new javascript is not this

173
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:47,160
keyboard helper at all but it's a

174
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,490
combination of some concepts right

175
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,009
isomorphic javascript is one of them

176
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,429
newer technology data science data

177
00:13:56,429 --> 00:14:00,209
visualization open source and more so

178
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:01,529
I'm going to walk you through step by

179
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:04,170
step how we came to visualizes brain

180
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,610
waves in the web browser okay so the

181
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,100
first thing we need to know is that here

182
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,120
I have a headset and that headset it's

183
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,519
from a company called open BCI and the

184
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,769
great thing and what make this headset

185
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,990
so special is the fact that this is

186
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,269
completely open source and it's mostly

187
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:30,179
truly printed so as you can see here

188
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:32,879
this mostly plastic what you see is in

189
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,589
white and in red this is all plastic the

190
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,329
other part of it is actually the board

191
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:42,749
that is actually doing you know all the

192
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,730
computing and then you have cables that

193
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,249
end up in some sensors and these sensors

194
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,949
are called electrodes these electrodes

195
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:52,860
are actually make contact with your head

196
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,249
and you can see here animation of how

197
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:59,100
actually comes together it's a lot of

198
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,240
tiny parts you can actually go to the

199
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,509
github repo download all the 3d files

200
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:09,029
print it yourself order the board

201
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,069
separately and you split it together and

202
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:15,720
get up and running the next part that I

203
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,420
want to show you is the use

204
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,230
dangal the USB dongle is this guy right

205
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,209
here that is what actually connects via

206
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:34,350
bluetooth to this board then it gets to

207
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,149
the computer right as it's plugged in is

208
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,680
USB via serial port and that is exactly

209
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,709
where node takes it in and let me tell

210
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,449
you a little bit of how known takes it

211
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:51,870
in just probably doing an NPM style for

212
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,079
the open PCI SDK you are able to start

213
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,389
interacting with this so what i've done

214
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,000
i've created a series of like classes

215
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,529
that i've strike this process in order

216
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,279
for me to use that data that you saw and

217
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,410
start doing stuff with that so i broke

218
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,630
it down into some concepts I have some

219
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,440
connectors and connectors they basically

220
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,920
transmit the data right and right now

221
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,649
the connector is like Bluetooth via

222
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,290
serial port I cleared it in an abstract

223
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,060
class so you can choose from other

224
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,949
connectors that might be available in

225
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:27,720
the future for example maybe one of

226
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,019
these this dongle maybe we can just

227
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,279
connect the Bluetooth directly to the

228
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,779
computer maybe we can just do it through

229
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,970
Wi-Fi maybe we can do it with the next

230
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,060
thing that comes out then we have

231
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,190
providers these providers actually

232
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,310
capture that signal and they facilitate

233
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,010
and they basically distributed to our

234
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,010
node application then we have modules

235
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,380
that they take these data they transform

236
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,740
it into different formats one of those

237
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,810
formats for example is a time series

238
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,029
another format could be a fast Fourier

239
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,310
transform and I'm going to walk you

240
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,799
through it by simply just instantiating

241
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,669
some of the connectors and signals we

242
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:15,120
can then start and instantiate and

243
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,880
initialize our modules in this case we

244
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,809
have some FFT we have some topographic

245
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:24,000
data we're going to be I might be

246
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,559
showing you later and then the time

247
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,620
series which is exactly the lines that I

248
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,040
show you first

249
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,370
they all take the signal which is the

250
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,870
provider that I was talking about and

251
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,390
lastly we can just invoke a method

252
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:45,250
called stream that basically makes

253
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,560
available the data and we pass it to

254
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,990
different providers like the signal

255
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,420
provider or motion capture signal

256
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,110
provider is that data that is is sent to

257
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,480
the front end and for example motion

258
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,870
capture in this example this bore

259
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,740
actually contains accelerometer data so

260
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,200
that's something that we can also use so

261
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,300
you will get coordinates of like XY and

262
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,640
Z as you're moving the headset which is

263
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,260
something that you can also play with

264
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,610
you're going to be getting one sample

265
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,070
every four milliseconds right which

266
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,090
makes a 250 sample rate and a sample is

267
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,310
what I show you from the node terminal

268
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,990
and it looks something like that the

269
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,490
most relevant information here it's

270
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,130
actually the channel data that is what

271
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,720
has the signal from each different sides

272
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,560
each different part of your brain so in

273
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,810
here we have eight and that is what

274
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,720
you're getting some of the actual nodes

275
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,580
are just for comfort so they sit on top

276
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,140
of your head the other ones are actual

277
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,060
electrodes and those are the one that

278
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,300
pick up the signal ox data is emotion

279
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,980
accelerometer data that I was telling

280
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,590
you about and then we have over type of

281
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,890
metadata like the start by the sample

282
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:07,810
number stop byte etcetera lastly we're

283
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:11,590
using WebSockets from node to send this

284
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,800
data treated in a different format that

285
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,950
I talked about FFT teleport I'm serious

286
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,320
and we use WebSockets to send it to the

287
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,700
client to the web browser and in the

288
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,830
example that I show you there are many

289
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,420
technologies that are being used one of

290
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,880
them is flatly we have smoothie charts

291
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,450
for the time series we have three GS for

292
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,470
some WebGL data visualizations that I'm

293
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,130
working on

294
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,880
we have charged a s we

295
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,100
Angra to which is the actual app and

296
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,300
what is putting everything together the

297
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,020
time series looks something like this

298
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:56,840
most of the time on a very well headset

299
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,810
that is calibrated and everything in it

300
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,990
has data coming from all the channels

301
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,560
and I'm going to walk you through some

302
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,050
code samples with angular 2 that show

303
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,810
you how you can capture this data from

304
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,700
WebSockets and how to display it on the

305
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:20,180
browser so who has these tight script or

306
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,010
angular 2 here can you please raise your

307
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,830
hands all right we have like a few

308
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,490
people good so I chose angular 2 because

309
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,940
I build the app using other different

310
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,950
libraries and angler two is where I

311
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,080
finally landed it had great performance

312
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,440
benefits that really helped me

313
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,160
accomplish this in a way that was

314
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,790
effective and scalable so I'm important

315
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,140
from dependencies including some

316
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,900
components from the element reference

317
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,530
and some component lifecycle hooks for

318
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,620
example the component is ready and when

319
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,600
it's destroyed then I'm importing some

320
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,670
dependencies for like the smoothie chart

321
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,920
this example is going to show you that

322
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,430
that time series I was telling you about

323
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,110
and before I do that I'm gonna quickly

324
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:38,470
fire on my simulated data

325
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,779
right so skinny if I see in the meantime

326
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:49,019
let me keep showing you some of the code

327
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:53,600
this is an annotation that you can do

328
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,359
with type script which is angular 2

329
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,289
specific you can see the add component

330
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:01,070
which basically points to a selector

331
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,960
which is like the BCI time series we

332
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,899
have a template URL we have a styles and

333
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:09,109
we have some providers this the angular

334
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:10,369
2 AP a-- has changed a little bit since

335
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,909
then but it's pretty much very similar

336
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:15,710
but if we're looking at the template of

337
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,059
this if we're looking at the template of

338
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:22,429
this component the most important part

339
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:26,320
is that it has a canvas element because

340
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,679
it's Moody Jes is foodie charts uses

341
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:33,950
canvas so then you're gonna see some

342
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,279
angular to specific syntax here where

343
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,879
you have the brackets for binding and

344
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:44,899
then you have the actual class

345
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:49,639
definition which is just an es es in es6

346
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:53,509
class that implements the on in it and

347
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:56,359
on destroy from angular 2 some

348
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:01,299
dependency injection via constructor and

349
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:04,489
finally then some data structures that

350
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:06,320
we're going to be using in order to fill

351
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,980
our data so we have some smoothie chart

352
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,379
containers for the time series the

353
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:14,779
amplitudes are the values are shown to

354
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:16,389
the right the numbers change

355
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:19,090
positive and negative energy in

356
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,950
microvolts then you have a time line

357
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,600
which is the second that you have at the

358
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,529
bottom telling you exactly where in time

359
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:30,200
that data to be expressed and then we

360
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,190
have lines which are eight lines from

361
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,100
different parts of our head all day all

362
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,480
of them they map to a time series

363
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,470
container so when the component

364
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,840
initializes we're going to be calling a

365
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,460
function that is going to basically

366
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,789
initialize our smoothie data structures

367
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:50,630
and then

368
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,630
we're going to be using socket IO to

369
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,090
listen for events that are related to

370
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,970
time once we capture those events are

371
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,640
related to time what we do is that we

372
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,740
get data back so this is exactly the

373
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,880
data that is coming from the server but

374
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,890
pipe through the connectors the

375
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,390
providers the signals that I told you

376
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,260
about that are basically reciting the

377
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,240
data to be kind of like fun and friendly

378
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,640
so we're not sending a data event to the

379
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,250
client every 4 milliseconds we actually

380
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,530
have a buffer a node that we're

381
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,179
aggregating a certain amount of data I

382
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:34,520
think probably every like 64 samples and

383
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,799
then we're passing it through some

384
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,110
filters and there was something into the

385
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:47,660
front end

386
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:53,790
ok Calendar so once we get that data we

387
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,480
replace the amplitudes object these

388
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,340
amplitudes is basically what is what

389
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,350
we're binding to in our template so

390
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,660
amplitudes is an object that we have in

391
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,630
our template and we can have that data

392
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,700
available for us to basically

393
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,880
semantically Express we have a time line

394
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,970
which is basically an array of seconds

395
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,970
and then we're appending time lines when

396
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:31,980
we append time lines

397
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,929
when we append timelines here we're just

398
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:38,029
going for each one of those channels in

399
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:40,809
this case 8 and we are basically

400
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:44,630
appending a data point right in this

401
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,940
case a line that is over calling aligned

402
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,149
so each one of those eight lines they

403
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,880
directly correlate with this part here

404
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,690
so each time we'll receive an event we

405
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,799
go through each one of the channels

406
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,769
we're appending with the current date

407
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,690
and time right with the current time and

408
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,510
we're passing an amplitude that

409
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,279
amplitude is just that data set that I

410
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,990
told you about here

411
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,730
from each other the different channels

412
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:16,639
and in this case when we're adding the

413
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:19,130
time series initially right that's

414
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,909
function that I show you right here

415
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:24,679
we're just making sure that they have a

416
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,070
stroke style that map to the color that

417
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,799
we want to use in this case is just a

418
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,429
lid an array with eight different colors

419
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:38,419
so we can classify a by color something

420
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:40,610
that is very important to mention is

421
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,000
that because there's going to be a lot

422
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,299
of events being received by the client

423
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:48,919
you know on the browser is very

424
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,539
important that if the component is

425
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:52,519
actually not being displayed in the

426
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,240
application basically when it fires the

427
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,010
undestroyed event from the angular 2

428
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,809
component life cycle we need to make

429
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,580
sure that we remove that event listener

430
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,860
because if we have all these events

431
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,019
still lingering from other components

432
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:08,600
are also showing data visualizations

433
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,779
then it's going to overwhelm the browser

434
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:16,820
it's going to probably freeze ultimately

435
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,110
this is just a little bit of more

436
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,710
angular 2 template that shows how to do

437
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,200
a repeater in angular 1 it was like it

438
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,240
and you repeat in angular 2 we have an

439
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,970
NG 4 and then we have a more es6 style

440
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,309
type of declaration here when you have

441
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:38,630
read amplitude of amplitudes and that is

442
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,809
exactly the amplitude element that has

443
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:46,110
been shown to the

444
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,559
the same for the time line were

445
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,550
iterating through each one of the of the

446
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,980
time line elements that we have I

447
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,530
believe in this case like 18 where

448
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,960
actually is in an html5 time element

449
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,890
with a game time attribute that

450
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,490
basically formats that formats that time

451
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,510
in seconds into readable human seconds

452
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,179
great so that being said I want to talk

453
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:16,240
to you about this product a little bit

454
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,220
I've been taking this in phases right

455
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,420
now it's just phase one which is simply

456
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,179
visualization right and we've put a lot

457
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:28,490
of work into just making sure we can

458
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,559
visualize brain waves but there's so

459
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,130
much more that we still need yet to do

460
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,570
second phase is going to be about

461
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,270
experimentation so we can actually take

462
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,070
that data do something useful with it

463
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,020
right and I will give you few examples

464
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,480
ultimately interpretation which is

465
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,870
really just really thoughts I believe is

466
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,730
possible and I believe that each one of

467
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,980
you with your JavaScript skills could

468
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,800
get to contribute or to be part of

469
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,080
something as big as this this is why all

470
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,600
of this work that I've shown you today

471
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,950
including the hardware everything is

472
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,400
open-source and very affordable just to

473
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,179
put together a simple headset this is

474
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,309
just an example of some experiments all

475
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:12,200
the people have done this one is in a

476
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,059
JavaScript as specific but there's

477
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:15,980
nothing that is actually stopping us

478
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,780
from starting to control things and

479
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,820
doing things with our current skills

480
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,600
here imagine you can control user

481
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,179
interface with this headset maybe

482
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:27,710
someone's disabled and now has the

483
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,320
ability to do something with their

484
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,700
computer and there are so many other

485
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,830
things including like maybe controlling

486
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,170
your wheelchair accessibility for the

487
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,080
web and actually just getting to know

488
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,970
ourselves a little better think about it

489
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,130
all the data is right here and we

490
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,540
struggle with knowing ourselves

491
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,760
sometimes but I think now we have the

492
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,810
power to take that information and

493
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,450
with something meaningful with it so I

494
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,700
encourage you to get involved there are

495
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,340
many many meetups about New York tech I

496
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,560
used to go to one in New York City but

497
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,790
there are in many parts of the world

498
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,020
github repo that I've been doing all

499
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,450
this work in is New York is in there you

500
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,340
can find exactly where sure today that

501
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,370
whole app and there is an open beside

502
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,890
community it's not JavaScript specific

503
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,900
voice from your tech oriented and

504
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,630
everyone is welcome there so that being

505
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,420
said please keep in touch and let me

506
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:35,520
know if you have any questions let's

507
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,590
give this another try

508
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,760
I came from very far and I'm gonna let

509
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,660
the cold or jetlag get in the way so

510
00:30:44,660 --> 00:31:01,830
thank you for joining again let's see

511
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,870
all right so you have only one channel

512
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,510
that is not really connecting well that

513
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:23,880
is 1 2 3 4 5 6

514
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,950
I think he doesn't have anything on the

515
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,650
side of the head but these are their

516
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,059
real brainwaves that I meant to show you

517
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:39,130
so thank you so here you can see to the

518
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,679
right you can see the voltage and you're

519
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,120
gonna see that fluctuating between

520
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,460
positive and negative values because

521
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,620
that's the way electrical signals work

522
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,080
they don't mean anything like positive

523
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,299
energy is not with them negative energy

524
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:55,540
is going to fluctuate so something else

525
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,710
I wanted to show you it's actually the

526
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,820
frequency when you pass a signal to a

527
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,580
fast for a transform this is actually

528
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,620
the frequency this is not like going in

529
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,230
time this is actually in real time the

530
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:13,059
way the frequencies translate so the

531
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:15,910
channel let's see the yellow one is

532
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,830
channel 6 that's the channel that's

533
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,590
we're not getting anything from that's

534
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,510
what you can see use today alright and

535
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,280
it towards the middle you're going to

536
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,370
see around this area here that things

537
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,200
are changed much is because in that part

538
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,990
of the frequency is being picked up by

539
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,419
like so I'm even like the background

540
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:40,630
noise so yeah just like the ambience

541
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,090
right like your body's receptive to that

542
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,490
so it's actually going to be translated

543
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:56,470
so you can see some of that well yeah

544
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,790
yeah and also is worth mentioning that

545
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,410
this headset in particular is also going

546
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,650
to pick up some emoji which is like the

547
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,770
muscular signals so let's do a little

548
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:12,910
experiment try blinking a couple of

549
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,810
times to

550
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:20,470
right regular horror yeah yeah so you

551
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,060
can see some of that being picked up

552
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,790
around here it gets very interesting

553
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,240
when you start seeing the frequency

554
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,030
categorize by different categorize by

555
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,790
different frequency bands so if you're

556
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,650
familiar with like data data alpha and

557
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,900
beta I can tell you for example

558
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,500
according to some experiment if you want

559
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,900
to measure hunger occurring to some

560
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,910
doctors some of the Delta band is going

561
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,040
to get lower and some of the alpha and

562
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,830
beta is going to get higher right so

563
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,320
this is also used to like measure

564
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,930
progress when it comes to like

565
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:02,890
concentration and meditation take a

566
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,200
screenshot take a screenshot yeah there

567
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,950
you go

568
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,030
this is just another way of showing

569
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:15,460
frequency in a 3-quart type of layout so

570
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,020
try to sleep in your jaw like like you

571
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,460
were like chewing something you can see

572
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,250
that being okay you can see that

573
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,570
actually the manifested here yeah yeah

574
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:37,270
but whatever you do okay thank you guys
