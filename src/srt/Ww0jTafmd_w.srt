1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,280

okay so my talk is called elements of

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,260
dance music um we're going to chat on

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,750
how to make people dance with music is

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,410
that another appropriate title so yeah

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,210
we're going to make music using only

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,080
maths no not a lot of sound samples no

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,730
nothing just like pure mathematics and

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,290
might even work we'll see how it goes so

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,660
I'm Paul I work at Mozilla on the Web

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,809
Audio API implementation I also do the

11
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,860
spec work at the w3c so we end up like

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,620
we write this massive massive massive

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,370
massive document that ends up telling

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,559
you how exactly where would you EP I

15
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,049
should work and and when I'm not working

16
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,960
I actually just make music with like

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,600
normal people not with math and software

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,520
and everything like that so yeah alright

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,330
without further due let's talk about

20
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,869
what we have for today so we'll do a

21
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,270
brief introduction and try to define and

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,200
characterize why is music yes big task

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,420
so it's going to be scoped pretty gnarly

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,570
and then we'll chat a bit of a verte a

25
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,369
specific genre of music school acid

26
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,790
techno general i like very much and

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,140
maybe do a little bit of the

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,630
construction of an acid techno track so

29
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,430
yeah listen to a couple tunes we'll see

30
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,140
how it goes maybe you understand the

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,960
parts of it and then we will learn on

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,780
how to like how Web Audio actually works

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,229
and try to bend these to make do an

34
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,840
actual technotrack like to make sound to

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,640
make the drums to make the synthesizers

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,640
and to make the yeah the Sun we want and

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,410
then we my

38
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,650
it's even try to do it live in a text

39
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,420
editor and just like you know dry too

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,750
quick dirty technotrack like and then

41
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,600
five and write some more texts and six

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,510
in my work seven if we have a good tune

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,450
me out just get up and dance right all

44
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,770
right first what is music so it's a

45
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,410
simplistic a simple definition is not by

46
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,800
any mean like the one definition react

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,530
academicians use to me and for today

48
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,810
music is rhythm + melody + timber right

49
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,860
so rhythm can be characterized the

50
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,660
absence of presence of a sound at some

51
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,700
point in time and the duration of its

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,520
sound so for example we have a note HB

53
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,330
for a quarter beat and we're gonna have

54
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,860
140 beats per minute right melody is the

55
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,630
sex session of a sound that have a

56
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,050
height a pitch and they constitute like

57
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,450
a unity right so it's a tune you can

58
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,060
sing and you remember that's desa melody

59
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,880
and what is more important to me and for

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,920
us today is a chamber so it's the

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,680
entrancing sunny quality of the sound so

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,110
for example is it like a pure tone is it

63
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,360
pitched like can you can you determine

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
the height is it a metallic sound is it

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,850
like bold like a violin is it like a

66
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,530
vocal like someone is speaking or

67
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,180
singing so yeah today we're gonna focus

68
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,150
on on tamron like actually making sound

69
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,290
that sound nice and yeah the code is

70
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,390
already written to make it sound where

71
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,770
it's like when it should happen and and

72
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,610
the notes already 13 so yeah but yet

73
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,200
tember isn't what is important for us

74
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,370
today okay so now we can talk maybe

75
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,300
about a general music school acid techno

76
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,310
is going to be a focus for today so the

77
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,760
sound design that we're going to do

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:33,400
might sound like that

79
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,080
alright so say yes electronic music as

80
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,100
you as you can hear got creating Chicago

81
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,680
and Detroit in late 80s Early 90s so

82
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,389
yeah so in this I in this specific track

83
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,990
that I made quickly the other day you

84
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,600
can hear two machines so it roland

85
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,860
tb-303 which is an bass synthesizer

86
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,970
which is like the little tone very harsh

87
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,520
very fast and there is like a roland

88
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,470
tr-808 which is drum machine so it's got

89
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,550
the kick drum clap hi hats so if we

90
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,820
listen to it again ok so in here we've

91
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,050
got the kick drum right and then we have

92
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:34,630
America's sound then we have some claps

93
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,240
right if we mix the drum together okay

94
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:47,710
cool then we've got a baseline

95
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,910
kinnear it changes i'll just play

96
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:57,610
you

97
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,820
and then if you mix everything and add

98
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,850
some delay and reverb like some effects

99
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,669
okay so that's the kind of the goal for

100
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,250
today so while we're doing it techno in

101
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,400
the first place it sounds good right

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,440
that's one thing it's also very simple

103
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,270
to code so i can explain you wear with

104
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,440
your concepts with that so the kick the

105
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,610
clap in the rad cast we're going to

106
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,060
we're going to synthesize are actually

107
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,190
going to be tr-808 simulation that's why

108
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,930
i was presenting this machine and the

109
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,210
baseline is going to be a tb-303 like

110
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,530
sound okay so without further ado let's

111
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,990
introduce the audio context and now from

112
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,060
no one's going to be all JavaScript and

113
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,460
some codes on the slide so please pay

114
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,910
attention is going to be worthwhile okay

115
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,440
so you've got this thing fire AC equals

116
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,729
new audio context and really when you

117
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,650
talk about where would your API there

118
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,210
are three main concepts you've gone know

119
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,919
your context you've got all your nodes

120
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,330
and you've got audio params right so

121
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,130
you've got a number of audio nodes like

122
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,479
a key I've seen this picture and you

123
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,550
connect them together using the Kinect

124
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,010
call so if you connect an oscillator

125
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,949
node to a gain node you will apply the

126
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:15,479
processing of the gain node from the

127
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,220
oscillator node and then if you connect

128
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,620
something to the destination node then

129
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,760
you will actually hear it in your

130
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,710
speakers which is what we need right so

131
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,080
what can you do with an audio context

132
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,780
you can you have the destination you

133
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,150
connect things to his destination you

134
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,340
have the current time so it's the time

135
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,130
of the audio context it's always going

136
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,430
forward you cannot really pose it it

137
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,020
cannot go backwards so it's always

138
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,690
progressing then you can create some of

139
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,639
your notes so for example an audio

140
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,710
buffer source node I can play another

141
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,190
buffer a gain node can change the volume

142
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,610
of its input an oscillator node can play

143
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,380
a simple wave form like a sine wave

144
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,169
square wave and things like that and a

145
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,210
biquad filter node can filter the sound

146
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,800
and alter its characteristics for

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,240
example removing the high

148
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,860
frequencies all the low frequencies or

149
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,599
something like that we will see more

150
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,319
example in a second what can you do when

151
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,060
you get an oscillator node so an

152
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,500
oscillator node can be connected to

153
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,349
another node you can also disconnect it

154
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,539
from the other nodes you can set the

155
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,009
frequency that is the height of the

156
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,009
sound you can slightly ditch you Nate to

157
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,050
make it more interesting you can change

158
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,880
this type for example whether it's a

159
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,510
sine wave square wave or so to what we

160
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,669
will see that in a second you can start

161
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,450
it at some specific time and then also

162
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,420
stop it at a specific time audio program

163
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,610
as you can see the frequency here and

164
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,670
the detune are both audio params right

165
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,470
so what can you do with an audio

166
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,990
parameter you can set the value here you

167
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,700
can set the value at a specific time so

168
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,480
you say set value at time for 10 at

169
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,850
exactly 10 seconds the value we jump to

170
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,250
for you can do an exponential ramp to

171
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,740
value at time so it will do a smooth

172
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,080
ramp from the current value to the next

173
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,360
value using an exponential curve you can

174
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,700
do the same with a linear ramp and you

175
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,649
can do a set target at time that will

176
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:22,529
gradually become goes to value from the

177
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,420
time time and with those with a constant

178
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,070
which is I explain it later with more

179
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,320
examples so it goes like that when you

180
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,390
do any do / am so for example here we do

181
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,220
set value at time 1 20 at 120 seconds it

182
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,930
jumps and then we do linear rom to

183
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,560
evaluate I'm 22 seconds at 0 it goes

184
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,320
down gradually like that and then we set

185
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
value at time again and then we do a

186
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,740
setter I get a timing decreases

187
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,779
exponentially like that okay so now we

188
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,839
will actually hear some sound ok so we

189
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,260
do an oscillator we create a gain node

190
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,899
we set it to a sine wave and we set it

191
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,649
to an a for which is 44 in Hertz and

192
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,110
then we will see two inputs so we will

193
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,610
change the frequency and we will change

194
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,649
the game then we connect everything

195
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:19,000
together and we start so it

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,150
change the frequency and we can change

197
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,920
the game all right so it's just a sine

198
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,290
wave ok now we can change and use

199
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,209
different type of wave

200
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:44,400
that's a square

201
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,970
and that's a triangle

202
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,590
and now we have a sawtooth

203
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,050
so it's different sounds pretty useful

204
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,620
all right now what can we do like this

205
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,360
pretty static not very interesting so we

206
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,900
can we can change things using the audio

207
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,240
param methods so for example if we take

208
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,490
a very low sine wave at a hundred Hertz

209
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,820
and then we set value at time at 120

210
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,000
which is no volume reduction and we set

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,670
a look at that time at 0 to 0 which is

212
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:23,180
silent it will do something like that

213
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,010
right can start to hear the start of a

214
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,430
kick drum maybe I one sec maybe you can

215
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,290
do a bit more so if you change the pitch

216
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:40,030
at the same time maybe yeah start

217
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,540
sketching like a kick drum okay we'll

218
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,400
see you later now we need a bass sound

219
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,830
right so what can we do we get like two

220
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,190
oscillators maybe to sawtooth set it to

221
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,980
the same frequency we're going to same

222
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,170
have two sliders to be able to change

223
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,770
the value of the day tune and and the

224
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,570
the value of the frequency and then we

225
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,800
connect everything together like the

226
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:18,670
usual okay

227
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,010
sounds better right yeah so yeah some

228
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,270
techniques we can we can learn

229
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,280
okay we need a bit more okay no need to

230
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,900
introduce a bit like a bit of a heavy

231
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,760
beasts like the Fourier transform your

232
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,880
friends so you can you can look at the

233
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,070
sound in the time domain where you see a

234
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,960
sine wave like looks like a sine wave

235
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,410
you all know we can also you see it in

236
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,350
the frequency domain where in the x-axis

237
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,910
you've got the frequency and in the

238
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,970
y-axis you've got the actual amplitude

239
00:12:51,970 --> 00:13:02,800
and then if we change the frequency so

240
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,030
yeah and if you change this he changed

241
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:13,360
it to square the number of different

242
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,570
patterns here

243
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,180
right so this just thing we're all using

244
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,270
the next point so now which we can do is

245
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,140
to filter the bass the bass right so for

246
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,700
that we use a biquad filter and we'll

247
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,010
get a saw tooth and we'll debt unit like

248
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,880
previously and then set a pretty low

249
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,340
frequency value and then we will get a

250
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,980
low pass so what the low pass is it lets

251
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,800
through the bass sound and it cuts the

252
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,560
high frequencies and then we will change

253
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,600
various characteristics of the bike

254
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,450
words so the frequency which is is it

255
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,960
cutting the high frequency at a very

256
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,710
high sound or very low sound the queue

257
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,920
you'll see in a second so what can we do

258
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,330
with us ok so we have a base right and

259
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:16,860
the red line is the filter right

260
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:26,240
we can change the characteristic amounts

261
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,640
all right

262
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:35,389
so the QE is little notch

263
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,819
let's call the resonance filter of

264
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:42,549
course you can go get high pass which is

265
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,549
exactly do

266
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,899
he cuts the law and like the high

267
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:52,540
frequencies like a treble stays here

268
00:14:52,540 --> 00:15:01,360
right and then you've got various other

269
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,149
stuff like a like a band pass that lets

270
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:06,179
through you're near specific frequency

271
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:12,910
but then we won't use it for now okay so

272
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,220
now what can we do like we go on and on

273
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,629
and on we create a buffer and then we

274
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,619
fill it with random noise not random so

275
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,689
it's noise between minus one and one

276
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:29,920
okay what's can Ladd to let me just drop

277
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,480
the balloon just noise it's gonna be

278
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,379
very useful to do or America's sound

279
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:40,980
just like yeah just random noise really

280
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,610
okay and then yeah for the clap I didn't

281
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,100
really feel like synthesizing a clump

282
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,709
because pretty hard so I'm using all the

283
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,959
facilities of the web would your API so

284
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,910
I'm fetching with a new fetch API which

285
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:00,339
is the new xhr an OGG file because like

286
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,649
that's the one one time I'm cheating and

287
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:04,449
I'm I've actually sampled the machine

288
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:08,040
and sorry it recorded it the sound and

289
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,410
you can use decode audio data to decode

290
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,529
the buffer it takes the same codecs as

291
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:17,439
the HTML media element and then it gives

292
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:18,939
you a decoded buffer and you can just

293
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,129
play it back right so you just played

294
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:22,959
back like that you get a buffer set the

295
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,179
buffer you set it to loop so it looks

296
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:27,459
indefinitely connect your destination

297
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:33,279
and start it sorry just just playing

298
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,800
back the clap yeah

299
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,040
so without further due let's try to make

300
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:53,829
a little something so okay so this is

301
00:16:53,829 --> 00:17:02,740
just a roof

302
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,640
ok

303
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,540
it's just a text editor I'm going to

304
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:17,420
just setting this up ok cool and then

305
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,120
what I need is my actual order Firefox

306
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,070
so I can run the code ok so this this

307
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:31,250
vim thing is running in which Firefox

308
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,440
I've got so many open yeah and this one

309
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,530
yeah so yeah let me just explain to you

310
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,230
what the code is here is doing I didn't

311
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,090
feel like as I said previously at we are

312
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,260
focusing on actually making the

313
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,380
instruments so the notes here I've

314
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,760
actually always been written so we just

315
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,430
have a tempo which is 135 beats per

316
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,320
minute which is normal for technology

317
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,960
and then we have a kick as we heard

318
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,080
previously that goes on each beat so one

319
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,180
silence silence silence once island sat

320
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,370
in silence and that goes for ever and

321
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,740
ever the hi-hats goes on the opposite so

322
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,590
that's going to be kick I had cake I had

323
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,130
the clap goes in the middle some time

324
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,130
here and then we've got some notes for

325
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,310
the base so that's me denotation if you

326
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,220
know what that is but like just just

327
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,670
know it's really then what we are doing

328
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,990
yeah we get s4 since we get to know do

329
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,330
contacts here we set the track so the

330
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,870
track is what we have just here we get

331
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,730
the destination here we get a clap

332
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,990
sample because I didn't feel like

333
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,530
synthesizing a clap again then we get a

334
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,910
noise buffer because we're going to need

335
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,060
a noise buffer then a couple acidity

336
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,280
function all the code is going to be a

337
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,860
liner as well with a lot of explanation

338
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,650
like text Jewish nation so the clock

339
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,980
lets us know what time it is in the

340
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,710
track we count not in seconds but in

341
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,740
beats that's easier if you want to do

342
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,470
audio-visual synchronization yeah so we

343
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,720
start the track and then we have a

344
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,450
little scheduler here so the scheduler

345
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,120
is continuously looping in the track and

346
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,640
telling you which know

347
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,200
you need to play and when you need to

348
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,810
play it and which and which instrument

349
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,230
has to play it so this is not very

350
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,670
complicated nor important topic for

351
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,510
today so let's just close it right so we

352
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,940
have four empty slots here we want to

353
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,520
kick drum whoops we want to kick drum we

354
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,490
want hi hats we want to clap and we want

355
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,610
to base right at the bottom is just the

356
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,250
initialization with the fetch and or new

357
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,570
audio context and everything so it's not

358
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:51,910
very important ok let's start trying to

359
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,170
make a kick drum right so it says boom

360
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,850
boom boom in the comment that's exactly

361
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,120
what's going to happen right so we're

362
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,330
going to get a first oscillator ok so we

363
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,400
do create oscillator and then what can

364
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,470
we do with an oscillator we can set the

365
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:18,070
type to a sine wave we can we also need

366
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,630
a gain node because we will need an

367
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,750
envelope so a kick is louder at the

368
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,610
beginning and quieter by the end so

369
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,260
let's gates let's get us a game node ok

370
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,190
create gain ok then of course we need to

371
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,690
connect the oscillator to the gain node

372
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,850
and the gain node to the actual

373
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:49,350
destination right we need to start the

374
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,510
oscillator in each function we get the

375
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,510
time T here so it's the time of which we

376
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,690
need to start the note and then we also

377
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,000
need to stop it at some point one second

378
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,320
is good is going to be shorter than one

379
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,610
second we need to stop it at some point

380
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,740
doesn't really matter and then we need

381
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,750
to decide like which curve we will get

382
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,640
to for our kick drum so let's start with

383
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,630
again so it's gonna it's going to start

384
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,170
at a full volume set value at time so

385
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,100
full volume is 120 and I was at T it's

386
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,660
at full volume so beginning of the kick

387
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,510
drum and then you will guard you leave

388
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,760
all target at time to 0 at time T as

389
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,620
well and the constant is how fast it

390
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,250
will go down so 0 dot one is pretty fast

391
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,580
but not too fast that's I guess it's

392
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,580
good then as we saw earlier we need to

393
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,970
set the we need to drop the frequency a

394
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,250
notch frequency okay set value at time

395
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,940
so a kick drum 120 Hertz is good I mean

396
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,860
I'm just doing those values on the top

397
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,200
of my head really like I've kind of

398
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
listened to 808 kick sound and it

399
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,730
sounded good so I yeah I was alright and

400
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,800
then it'll it also drops to around 50 a

401
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,070
bit shorter okay so yeah maybe we can

402
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,690
try to hear do we hear something ok

403
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:42,510
let's Britta maybe you can make it a bit

404
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,120
yeah that's better so it's not that okay

405
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,450
um we can we can really make the kick

406
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,500
drum would be better if we do like a bit

407
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,640
more of an attack sound so I'm just

408
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,340
typing this real quick what we want is a

409
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,040
is a sound of the beater on the on the

410
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,510
kick drum right so it's going to be full

411
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,220
of high frequencies and yeah I'll see

412
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:16,550
how it goes so hmm just like doing

413
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:21,999
something real quick here

414
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:26,369
a second sound is exactly the same calls

415
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:35,700
a very much shorter though um what can

416
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,889
we do what do you need yeah oh and we

417
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:39,799
need to connect everything together

418
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:46,590
oscillator 2 with gain too oops into ok

419
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,279
does that sound better no it doesn't

420
00:23:50,279 --> 00:24:01,350
what have I forgotten oh yeah so that's

421
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,519
a bit of a better kick right ok alright

422
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,019
that's good we've got a kick but we've

423
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:08,669
got a number of more instruments to go

424
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:13,820
right so let's start with some high hats

425
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,190
so for the high hats i canna sound like

426
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,059
a noise bursts but we need to remove the

427
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,129
low-frequency content because we it

428
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,019
doesn't have a real bass sound of high

429
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,799
hat not really so let's see we need to

430
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,279
play back a noise buffer so for that we

431
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:35,119
use the audio buffer source node thing

432
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:40,850
source ok and then we set its buffer to

433
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,200
a noise buffer so in noise buffer is

434
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,100
where is no its buffer yeah so a noise

435
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,190
buffer is just a buffer that contains

436
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,980
random values between minus 1 and 1 so

437
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,220
yeah it's just playing that box not very

438
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,740
complicated or anything and then of

439
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,159
course we always need a gain node

440
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,820
because percussions have like a

441
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,649
different amplitude during the of the

442
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:14,809
over the course of the sound creates gay

443
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:19,999
ok then we will need a high-pass filter

444
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:29,249
hpf create biquad filter ok and we will

445
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:34,409
set it too high pass so the high pass as

446
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,520
it I

447
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,100
name suggests it lets through the high

448
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,500
frequency let them pass but it cuts it

449
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,140
cuts the low frequency right and we set

450
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,560
it to a frequency of randomly chosen

451
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:54,840
five thousand Hertz as usual we we

452
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,000
started at full volume at time T and oh

453
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,030
it's called gain and then it drops in

454
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,890
volume to 0 at time zero it's fairly

455
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,600
short so 0.02 is going to be a very

456
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,940
short sound then we need to connect

457
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,670
everything together so source connect

458
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:25,620
gain connect I pass filter connect these

459
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,890
dots sink and then we need to start it

460
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,840
and then stop it oh no no it will stop

461
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,310
whenever whenever it reach the end of

462
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,100
the buffer automatically okay so it does

463
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,550
that sound alright oh my season yeah so

464
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:51,790
that's a little symbol the Americas okay

465
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:57,120
okay cool ah ok we go now we need we

466
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,910
need a clap sound okay so clap is just

467
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,610
playing back the buffer so and we do

468
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,570
like virus source equals this AC create

469
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,470
before Souls exactly like before and

470
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:13,230
then we actually don't want it full

471
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,990
volume we want we want a bit not very

472
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,330
loud so we all create a gain node for

473
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,990
that as well you always have a ton of

474
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,480
game knows where you where would you

475
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,600
like a ton create gain okay and then we

476
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,880
connect the source to the game oops no

477
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,890
connect to the game and then connect the

478
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:40,140
game to the sink okay and then we need

479
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,040
to source dot buffer equals the clap a

480
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,790
clap is something we just got using this

481
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,890
fetch thing here

482
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:55,020
um and it's the sound of a clap and then

483
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,320
we start it same thing is going to be

484
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,120
stopped it's going to stop automatically

485
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:17,610
so does it's all right okay okay okay

486
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,970
and now we need as it is written in your

487
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,920
strength here we need to drop the bass

488
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,600
okay so let's do this as we saw to

489
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,540
sawtooth together slightly detuned sound

490
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,200
good so you're going to give it a go so

491
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,730
we need to create two oscillators then

492
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,090
we create a gain node always great to

493
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:50,040
gain node O'Kane okay and then we'll

494
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,210
need a filter as filters I'll call

495
00:28:53,210 --> 00:29:00,990
create by quiet ok so we connect all

496
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:12,890
this little world together last two okay

497
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,240
then what can we do we need so as you

498
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,190
can see here we've got the actual notes

499
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,470
we need to play passage to us bio

500
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,520
scheduler isn't it nice so we need to

501
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,640
set the frequency of the nodes okay so

502
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,490
oscillator dot frequency dot set value

503
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,450
at time then we've got a little helper

504
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,480
at the top so from a note to a frequency

505
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,270
it's this barbaric formula that you can

506
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:45,070
find on Wikipedia so not to frack oh

507
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,980
it's tea and then same so I follow first

508
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,650
and the second one then we did tune one

509
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,430
oscillator like we saw in the slide

510
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:06,720
before and then set the two to sawtooth

511
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,010
so tooth because like in the original

512
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,870
303 you could choose between so 2000

513
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,610
square but i think i prefer the so to

514
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:20,070
sound so let's let's go with it and then

515
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,410
give it a little envelope so it doesn't

516
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:36,960
sound boring gain gain set target oops

517
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,600
mm-hmm fairly short as short as the kick

518
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,400
because the kick was also zero point

519
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,380
wine in a constant then we will set some

520
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,630
value on the filter so fairly aggressive

521
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,890
resonance and then we will automate the

522
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,510
filter as well so the filter cutoff

523
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,670
frequency will change over the course of

524
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,160
the notes so the Sun will not get very I

525
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,190
will not be boring because boring sound

526
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,080
you just want to like shut it off and

527
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,010
really don't want to listen to it mmm so

528
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,960
let's start at three hundred again just

529
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,840
picking the value randomly

530
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:27,000
yeah and going up to 3,000 fairly short

531
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,790
again and the filter will let the bass

532
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,350
through and we'll cut off the high

533
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,110
frequency right so for that will use a

534
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:41,120
low pass because let lets the low pass

535
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:50,890
and then we start all that jars start t

536
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:57,410
stop at somewhere in the future t plus 1

537
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:03,240
okay is that gonna work I think it's

538
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:26,970
some licks okay I had for Burton to

539
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,300
connect it to the actual destination

540
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,860
yeah wasn't going to work okay let me

541
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:59,510
get this one back okay

542
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,570
alright so maybe we can try to make it a

543
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,500
little more interesting and can I'll

544
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:14,980
know I like 10 minutes okay what we can

545
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,040
do is to dynamically change the value of

546
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:26,500
the filter and so let's try that so

547
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,390
we'll put variable here prick equals and

548
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,460
then we'll drop a slider so if I are

549
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:43,080
equals document create element inputs

550
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,950
inputs these days with html5 can do

551
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,940
really crazy stuff input type range

552
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:57,370
input min on a thousand maybe and Max to

553
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:09,220
10,000 input step 1 then inputs on

554
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:19,000
inputs I'm going to go okay so we're

555
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,360
going to say Frank equals 0 dot target

556
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,889
what are you and so that will all change

557
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,399
the frequency of the filter of course I

558
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:37,760
need to do document appendchild oops

559
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:45,020
input no slider it's called I it's got

560
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,330
okay

561
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,179
is it working

562
00:34:52,179 --> 00:35:02,440
I lied saw one ah yeah good one okay is

563
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:40,839
that dropping a slider nothing is

564
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:43,930
starting to to work don't do only

565
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,160
something else um yeah I think I'm

566
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,319
pretty much done uh-oh can take

567
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:54,460
questions long yep Wow thank you Paul

568
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:00,460
big round of Gloucester so this is how

569
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,670
we learn how to make sounds and music

570
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,680
eventually I would love to have some

571
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,970
questions hi that's awesome I got a real

572
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,549
light away I got one question about the

573
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:14,849
way you're constructing the sounds yep

574
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:16,990
every time you trigger a sound you

575
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,910
you're constructing the whole thing is

576
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,990
there a reason you're doing that as

577
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,359
opposed to making a once and then doing

578
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:25,540
a start and stop each time so I've got

579
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,309
two answers for you the first answer

580
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:31,000
would be yes you could create your note

581
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,430
once and seek a gain node in front of it

582
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,940
and mute it the second answer is you

583
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,940
cannot restart a note once it started

584
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,640
and stopped you gots garbage collected

585
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,880
right so it's kind of like a

586
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,010
fire-and-forget kind of model the nodes

587
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,230
are extremely cheap to create and are

588
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,390
extremely cheap to destroy so that's it

589
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,480
simplifies the model so you don't have

590
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,980
to keep track of how many voices you

591
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,490
have and things like that so yeah two

592
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:03,549
models either create all the nodes in at

593
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:05,319
each time like I'm doing

594
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:09,249
here because it's a bit more simple the

595
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:12,190
second yeah you can just stick a game

596
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,349
note and sticking again now in front of

597
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:16,569
it is much more like the old analog

598
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,999
analog way of doing things so when you

599
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:21,670
have a voltage controlled amplifier as

600
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,579
it's called vca so we have two way of

601
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:26,529
doing things I picked one for this talk

602
00:37:26,529 --> 00:37:35,410
really hello what is between this and

603
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,759
doing something like the cerrado

604
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:40,150
software in a browser hard work and

605
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:47,529
tears so serato for the people who know

606
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:50,049
we don't know about it is a thing where

607
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:53,199
you put like kind of fake vinyls and and

608
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,279
you can play mp3's and the vinyl yeah

609
00:37:57,279 --> 00:37:58,779
you know the orientation the speed of

610
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:01,059
the vinyl on your turntable so you can

611
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:03,339
actually scratch with your mp3's right

612
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:07,660
so that's the idea about it so no it's

613
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,599
like I think is very much possible

614
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,269
people have done turntable applications

615
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:16,029
on the web before so if we if you

616
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:17,769
haven't even hit me up afterwards I can

617
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,380
give you some names is yeah it's kind of

618
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,809
working pretty nicely but yeah I mean

619
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:25,719
just work you need you need to do it

620
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:28,690
basically I'm making sense maybe you can

621
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:33,789
make the next era so on the web so the

622
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:36,069
two that you visualize a frequency I

623
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:38,680
think it looks really useful to me like

624
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,499
I think that that's all I've I knew that

625
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:43,049
there's the q value that you can play to

626
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:45,699
adjust somebody like I could not

627
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,769
understand and i never knew like what

628
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:50,920
that means so how do you draw that red

629
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,880
line and you know the shape of dirt so

630
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,369
in the Web Audio API there is this node

631
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,440
that I have not presented but that

632
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,229
exists that is called the analyzer node

633
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:05,410
so the analyzer node you connect to

634
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,660
analyze the UConnect other nodes to the

635
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,849
analyzer node and it gives you either

636
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,739
time domain or frequency domain

637
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:15,670
representation of of the data that in

638
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,009
input and then it gives you a buffer and

639
00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:18,440
then you

640
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,150
I'm just drawing the buffer on the

641
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,040
canvas I repeatedly using

642
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,160
requestanimationframe so this one way of

643
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,829
doing things for the filter for the

644
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:30,650
filter there is a method on the bicoid

645
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,020
filter that can give you what is called

646
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,150
the frequency response of the filter and

647
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:39,050
then you give it a number of frequency

648
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,660
where you you want the the information

649
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,150
and it gives you back a buffer that says

650
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,000
oh I'm catching at this frequency and

651
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,440
I'm boosting at this frequency and

652
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,690
things like that so but the code is

653
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,720
going to be online I have a last slide

654
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,780
to show with a number of URLs if

655
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:02,630
possible okay so thanks starters and and

656
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,130
the other code I've presented today I've

657
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,470
made a later literate JavaScript program

658
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,869
that explains you in-depth how it works

659
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:16,099
and possible ways of making it better if

660
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:17,869
you want to know more about synthesis

661
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:20,660
and how to emulate all the analog gear

662
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,510
you just search since secrets on google

663
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,780
and give you like a 60-year something a

664
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,569
article series so yeah of course Twitter

665
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:31,430
get a pad not an email if you if you

666
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,190
need anything from me but yeah so it is

667
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,220
like a literate JavaScript program so

668
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,650
JavaScript on the right and pros on the

669
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,119
left that explains everything that it's

670
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,569
doing so yeah that's yeah so it's

671
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:47,140
exactly the program that I wrote so I

672
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,579
mean exactly not because like it was

673
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:52,130
improved but like it does kind of the

674
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,960
same sound it same technique is same

675
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,240
instruments but yeah so yeah feel free

676
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,280
to read to read it to read up on that

677
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,010
because not sure about you that I find

678
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,609
it pretty fun right thank you so much

679
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:08,570
for thank you amazing
