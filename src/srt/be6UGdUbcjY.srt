1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:23,390

you

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,689
alright so yeah it's great to be here

3
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:28,329
thank you for having me in Manila thanks

4
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:31,060
Thomas and Rico for organizing this my

5
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,940
name is Bryan as you said I'm a creative

6
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,610
developer I work with a company called

7
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,890
happy yak we do interactive video back

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,940
in the states from New York so I'm going

9
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,769
to talk to you about my project

10
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:48,820
seriously Jas today first a little bit

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,629
of context I want to talk about what it

12
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:54,760
is that we really kind of love about the

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,119
web first right first thing I think is

14
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,000
its interactive it kind of you know

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,210
responds to you both in the kind of you

16
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,970
know responding to your mouse clicks in

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,430
keyboard and touch like that things like

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,850
that it's it's up to the minute it's up

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,130
to date so you know if you go and look

20
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,619
at a web page or a web app that thing

21
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,479
can be you know it's the latest thing

22
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,909
it's not like a book or a movie frozen

23
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,130
in time it's connected originally

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,750
through servers and now with with WebRTC

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,530
to to peers so you can kind of

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,409
communicate with it and the other thing

27
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:36,670
one of my favorite things about it is

28
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,920
this view source is that you can kind of

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,200
take it apart it's not this kind of

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,110
locked black box you can go in and you

31
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,180
know see what other people did and you

32
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,710
look at the source of a web page and

33
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,270
copy it and paste it and it's a great

34
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,909
way it really encourages remix and

35
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,580
mashups and learning and I think it's

36
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,580
why you know you can it's not this kind

37
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,700
of esoteric impossible to understand

38
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,560
saying that you need to go be an

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,090
apprentice somewhere to learn it you can

40
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,890
really pull it apart yourself and learn

41
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,539
it and it's great in certain media the

42
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,000
web started out with text on hypertext

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,730
so it's it's kind of mature in that

44
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,670
sense and it's great at it Along Came

45
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,019
layout the CSS and and then and then

46
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:24,970
still images right so it's pretty good

47
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,409
at presenting still images and we have

48
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:28,569
to deke an vez for modifying those

49
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,170
images and

50
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,450
creating some images on the fly and now

51
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,050
video and audio but until very recently

52
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,450
the last couple of years videos kind of

53
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,010
been a second-class citizen on the web

54
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,290
it's been sort of a black box you know

55
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,930
when video was in in flash or even

56
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,000
before that in like quicktime embed

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,770
objects for those of you have been

58
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,280
around longer it's a you know it's sort

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,770
of like you you couldn't really affect

60
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,090
it you could just kind of embed it on

61
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,470
the web and the web is really just a

62
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,260
delivery platform for some of them is

63
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,420
kind of less than TV but now you know

64
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,920
i'm going to show you this I think a lot

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,690
more we can do it you know there's the

66
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,180
HTML video element we can embed it as

67
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,860
part of the page and apply CSS

68
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,380
transitions to it as well but now with

69
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,630
canvas and with WebGL we can have access

70
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,569
to the actual pixels and really mess

71
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,180
with it and kind of explore it and push

72
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,319
it to some new limits so what's so great

73
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,230
about video in the first place right so

74
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,150
a video is visually expressive a little

75
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,510
bit unlike this slide here and it

76
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,940
expresses stories ideas and emotions

77
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,890
through moving images and sound right

78
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,459
and it does that through you know with

79
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,280
music and dialogue with text hopefully

80
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,489
not so much text with quote unquote real

81
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,400
images and then kind of simulated images

82
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,390
through whether it's trick photography

83
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,170
or or CGI or you know whatever else

84
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,340
right so what if though we could take

85
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,920
those great sings about video and those

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,299
great things about the web and kind of

87
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:08,859
bring them together right because all

88
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,660
those things before I said that we're so

89
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,269
great about the web video traditionally

90
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,100
has none of that right it's not really

91
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,459
interactive it's it's not up to date you

92
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,680
know if you buy a DVD like that DVD is

93
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,050
that DVD until you lose it or throw it

94
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,700
away or it becomes obsolete you can't

95
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,639
plan anymore it's not really connected

96
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,660
it's kind of an isolated experience and

97
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,979
it certainly doesn't really have much in

98
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:34,720
the way of view source you know if you

99
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,030
want to mash something up you you don't

100
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,740
really you know use a lot you can do

101
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,360
with video mashups but you don't you

102
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,750
don't really

103
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,660
like the project files right but you

104
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,040
know with if we combine it with the web

105
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,400
maybe we can get all of that out of both

106
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,280
so that brings us to seriously Jas right

107
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,160
which is a real-time node based video

108
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,020
effects compositor for the web with

109
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,740
html5 JavaScript and WebGL right so

110
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,020
video effects compositing is kind of the

111
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,960
kind of the key words here so what is

112
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,410
that right now originally sort of in the

113
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,320
beginning of kind of computers being

114
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,420
involved in film we had quote unquote

115
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,120
CGI which is like your basic 3d graphics

116
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,890
and then that started out I think the

117
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,500
first film that that used it was a star

118
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,170
trek to and like a visualization of the

119
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,480
Genesis project and you know when it got

120
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,690
us movies like Tron and longmore man

121
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,920
real cinema classics you know um and

122
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,270
then you know those pics are guys I

123
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,990
guess they did some stuff that was okay

124
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,130
you know but but that was kind of a for

125
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,560
a long time it was just like you know

126
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,990
what like trauma and and no more man

127
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,730
it's you you have these movies that are

128
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,640
about the computer graphics right and it

129
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,270
was only later that we started to see

130
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,160
where the the computer generated stuff

131
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,410
would mix with the live-action video and

132
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,360
that's that's from video compositing

133
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,880
right so this is a sample from from Life

134
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,120
of Pi right which is supposed to bits

135
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,250
fantastical but it's not about computer

136
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,750
graphics there's no point where you're

137
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,190
watching the movie where you to go oh

138
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,470
yeah that's that's a computer I get it

139
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,540
you know I see the polygons right you're

140
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,000
really trying to hide all that and they

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,500
you know they shot that home most of

142
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,570
that movie in a studio with a swimming

143
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,030
pool in a big blue screen and you know

144
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,070
the compositing was where they they put

145
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,840
in the background and they put in the

146
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,430
rain and they put in the weather and the

147
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,240
fog and then they affect the color you

148
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,550
know and you can really kind of see the

149
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,310
difference there so seriously Jas is an

150
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,020
effort to see if we can do some of that

151
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,130
in a web browser right now it's inspired

152
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,440
by some software that is traditionally

153
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,940
used for for static compositing

154
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,680
right so this is this is after effects

155
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
made by adobe a lot of people use that I

156
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,890
guess this is a scene from iron man also

157
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,070
nuke is a really great one that's using

158
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,140
a lot of professional films for for the

159
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,790
like Hollywood films for this kind of

160
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,350
compositing nuke is also a node-based

161
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,610
compositor like seriously so it's

162
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,560
inspired by that and I'll explain a

163
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,040
little more about what i mean by notes

164
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,140
so first seriously Jess includes a

165
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,970
number of video effects that you can

166
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,680
just apply to a video and you can do it

167
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
in real time which I'm going to I'm

168
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,410
going to demo for you guys in a little

169
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,490
bit so it includes color effects which

170
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,960
is just kind of straight up kind of

171
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,700
tweaking the color it's kind of like

172
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,400
Instagram right and there's a range of

173
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,340
those things like blur which is you know

174
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,840
a little more rather than just tweak the

175
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,280
individual color the pixels it kind of

176
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,580
affects the pixels at the left and right

177
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,050
keying like chroma key and luma key

178
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,480
that's like blue screen green screen

179
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,770
that's pretty powerful pretty cool and

180
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,230
then just kind of various kind of style

181
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,130
izing things and a bunch more right we

182
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,780
also provide a kind of some-some

183
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,180
transforms where you can you can scale

184
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,550
the video and you can move it around and

185
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,350
skew it and stretch it in all kinds of

186
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,080
dimensions that's going to become pretty

187
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,310
cool a lot of that stuff you can do in

188
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,840
CSS but when you combine it with the

189
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,750
effects it's more powerful so before I

190
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,800
show you some demos I want to talk a

191
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,900
little bit about kind of the motivation

192
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,060
behind the technology and why this WebGL

193
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,750
stuff is so transformative right so

194
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,030
WebGL right usually you think WebGL is

195
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,610
like you know 3d right and that's kind

196
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,830
of the kind of base case for it you know

197
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,169
three Jas is great and you know you see

198
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:32,300
all these demos with flying squares and

199
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,030
fish and stuff like that but WebGL

200
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,210
really it's actually just a 2d API it's

201
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,070
really designed for drawing triangles on

202
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,740
this screen and you kind of transform

203
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,190
those triangles right with so we just

204
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,780
kind of use that we just draw two

205
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,220
triangles in the shape of a rectangle

206
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,140
one big rectangle that fills the whole

207
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,420
screen right and we just kind of use the

208
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,529
video as

209
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:56,839
as a texture on that tron because you

210
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,610
know play textures to the GPU and render

211
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,089
those on your triangles right and we use

212
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,220
it's kind of a perspective transform so

213
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,589
which is you know what what WebGL and

214
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,240
OpenGL usually used to get a 3d effect

215
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,149
we can use that to just kind of you know

216
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,680
move things around like I was talking

217
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,300
about with the the different transforms

218
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,529
and then we write a shader which if you

219
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,110
don't know a shader is a small program

220
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,209
that gets uploaded into your GPU and

221
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:26,269
runs at each sort of vertex of your

222
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,149
polygon or at each pixel and it gets the

223
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,860
input color and it press and some other

224
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,420
information and it spits out a new color

225
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,740
right now why not 2d canvas right we've

226
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,410
had two de canvas around for awhile it

227
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,439
can access images in the video it's a

228
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:45,230
lot more widely available than WebGL and

229
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,980
it's a lot more it's much much easier to

230
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,509
use like writing shaders is actually

231
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:54,589
really hard now so here's an example so

232
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:56,779
so back when when the 2d canvas first

233
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,519
kind of came around with like you know

234
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,800
the beginning of html5 and you could

235
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,839
access video with it there was some

236
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,550
examples of somebody doing like chroma

237
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,319
keying or you know kind of a green

238
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,660
screen effect so here's some code that I

239
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,769
kind of grabbed from from that I'm just

240
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,240
going to kind of highlight it right and

241
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,569
point out the kind of key components

242
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:20,029
right so just kind of the way that the

243
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,620
browser gives you access to the video

244
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,660
pixels the first thing you have to do is

245
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,399
you have to take your video element

246
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,629
right which is this kind of video

247
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,610
variable here and you draw it to your

248
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,459
graphics your 2d context right because

249
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:34,550
you can't directly access the video

250
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,259
pixels from the video but you can access

251
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:38,269
the pixels from the canvas so first you

252
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,250
have to draw it to a canvas then you get

253
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,529
the pixels from the canvas right then

254
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,240
you go through the pixel the pixel data

255
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,220
a process is at one pixel at a time and

256
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,079
you you check there's like a distance

257
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,179
function here that tells you whether or

258
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:52,730
not you know it's the color matches and

259
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,860
then you set the alpha channel 20 right

260
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,269
because you get your red blue green blue

261
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,980
and alpha and alpha is your transparency

262
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,160
challenge channel and then you put the

263
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,769
image back into once you've processed it

264
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:05,509
you display the image by putting that

265
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:06,190
array

266
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,540
get into the into the display canvas and

267
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,340
this is originally when I decided I want

268
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,870
to do this compositing effects this is

269
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,000
what I did but it didn't work and the

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,650
reason is there's a couple of reasons

271
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,760
the first reason is what we're doing

272
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,640
here is we're doing with copy a copy and

273
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,220
and allocate process one pixel at a time

274
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,650
and the cpu with tons of these memory

275
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,140
accesses that a little bit slow and then

276
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,570
a third copy right because the thing is

277
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,340
that when you when you copy when you get

278
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,290
the image data from your canvas it

279
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,270
doesn't let you get the image data into

280
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,790
an existing array it makes a new array

281
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,190
so if you were to have a high definition

282
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,860
video right that's 1280 pixels by 720

283
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,830
pixels by and the four bytes per pixel

284
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,380
because red green blue and alpha you

285
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,550
know you're looking at about three and a

286
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,410
half megabytes right so that's three and

287
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,590
a half megabytes copied three x plus

288
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,780
allocated and then garbage collected 30

289
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,120
times a second right and that'll slow

290
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,650
you down plus and that's not even with

291
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,850
the processing and this is just one

292
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,880
effect right so we tried it it didn't

293
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,080
really work we were getting really slow

294
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,880
frame rates you can see there's a couple

295
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,020
demos out there that do it with these

296
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,970
tiny little postage stamp-sized videos

297
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,130
that kind of remind me of the old cd-rom

298
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,050
days in the 90s but you know I'm pretty

299
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,120
old so anyway so we do it in WebGL so

300
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,640
WebGL is much much faster it processes

301
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,520
things in parallel there's a there's

302
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,920
kind of fewer of the video copies and

303
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,100
the applications and once you've got

304
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,130
your data on the GPU access to it within

305
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,800
the GPU is very very very fast and it

306
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,750
processes depends on what kind of

307
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,190
hardware you have but it processes many

308
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,460
pixels all at the same time right so now

309
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,930
how about this no thing right so i

310
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,580
talked about nodes it has nothing to do

311
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,890
with no Jas it's just a coincidence that

312
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,710
it's called that by the way it works is

313
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,330
kind of we have three or four different

314
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,640
kinds of nodes right you start off with

315
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,220
your source node which that accesses

316
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,230
your image source right so that can be a

317
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,150
video it can be an image it can be a

318
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,100
canvas really anything you want right

319
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,170
and you can make a number of those right

320
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,960
you can even actually access a pixel

321
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,480
array if you have that or dis ting web

322
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,950
GL texture if you want to bring it in

323
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,940
from something like three days and then

324
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,019
you got an effect no

325
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,059
right or one or more effect notes you

326
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:23,949
can chain the effect notes which takes

327
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:25,829
so each of these arrows kind of

328
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:28,239
represents the image data transitioning

329
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:31,300
from one note to the next right kind of

330
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,759
like an assembly line or if you've ever

331
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,769
used like a like audio-video equipment

332
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:37,389
and like like each one of those is kind

333
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,339
of like a cable right where each box

334
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:41,410
does something your signal and passes it

335
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,299
along it's not like the the data flow

336
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:44,589
stuff that time I was talking about

337
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,499
yesterday so the effect note processes

338
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:49,929
it and the output is the result to a

339
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:54,279
target mode which is your canvas and the

340
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,470
kind of the JavaScript kind of

341
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,209
infrastructure of seriously Jas and

342
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:01,569
design to it kind of has sort of a push

343
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:04,509
and pull model where it's smart enough

344
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:06,100
not to render things that doesn't need

345
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,509
right so if you start with the static

346
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:13,059
image and aura or a video and the video

347
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,249
is paused right it doesn't need to

348
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:17,889
update that but if you tweak the knobs

349
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,929
on one of the effects it needs to update

350
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,910
that so it kind of every time you get an

351
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,089
update it sort of pushes forward into

352
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:26,709
the network into the network of nodes

353
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,170
and marks everything is dirty and then

354
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,819
it goes to the end to the target node

355
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,649
the output node and it tracks back

356
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,529
rendering each one as it goes along so

357
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,749
it's really smart if you if you ever run

358
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,509
one of the demos you see that the you

359
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:41,889
know if it's ever still the frame rate

360
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:43,990
is very high the CPU usage is very low

361
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,999
and it only kind of bumps up again once

362
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:49,689
you start playing or modifying it you

363
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,490
can also have like an example of the

364
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,610
split notes you can have multiple

365
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,689
sources and that's this is where it

366
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:58,179
really becomes compositing so whether a

367
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:00,610
split or a blend so it does like for

368
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,829
example all of the Photoshop blend modes

369
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,959
you can layer one mode on top of another

370
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,139
and you can have opacity and you know

371
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:09,669
alpha channels and all that cool stuff

372
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:13,449
it's pretty cool there's also a

373
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:15,879
transform nodes which are cool which is

374
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,100
for moving things around you can

375
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,139
basically do it what's called a

376
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,899
perspective transform transform so as

377
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:24,429
long as it's kind of a uniform you've

378
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:26,860
got your you're preserving your your

379
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,529
rectangle in 3d space you can do

380
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,119
whatever you want you can't really bend

381
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:31,510
it

382
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,570
that would require an effect node but

383
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,830
that's really cool for like moving

384
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,410
things around so you know yesterday Leia

385
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,960
was showing some of the stuff with CSS

386
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,970
you know where you have this kind of

387
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,050
face that wants to move around in a

388
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,170
circle and you can you can kind of

389
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,490
composite multiple transforms on another

390
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,380
on one another and the way that works

391
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,360
it's retro really efficient is that it

392
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,970
combines them all into one so when you

393
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,550
get the output of your effect node the

394
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,320
transform node all that really is is a

395
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,410
very simple four by four matrix

396
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,130
multiplication in which you can do in

397
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,140
javascript and it's super fast and it

398
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,760
doesn't actually process the image and

399
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,640
it changes those a change those all into

400
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,310
one sort of little squeezes into one

401
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,880
computation and then puts that send that

402
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,440
trance that matrix transform that four

403
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,690
by four matrix into the target node

404
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,330
which then uses that in the shader and

405
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,130
calculates the output it's a bit

406
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,370
technical but it ends up being pretty

407
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,240
fast so now what's the API like how do

408
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,350
we use this right so seriously j/s have

409
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,220
kind of somewhat I don't say unique but

410
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,350
i wanted it was important to me to

411
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,630
target the audience when designing the

412
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,290
api right I really you kind of have to

413
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,090
audiences right you have your plug-in

414
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,370
developers who are going to actually

415
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,800
build the effects and want to get in

416
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,660
under the hood of seriously and then you

417
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,770
have your kind of the people are going

418
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,720
to use the API and I really wanted to

419
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,220
make this available to people who don't

420
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,190
necessarily have a really long

421
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,800
programming background you know people

422
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,870
who access like you know who learned

423
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,760
through code Academy or just a little

424
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,110
little bits of tinkering I want to make

425
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,980
that easy for them and then you know

426
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,020
it's it's a frame rates really important

427
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,750
so we prioritize general just generally

428
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,459
when work when I'm coding a prioritized

429
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,170
performance when you're in loop you know

430
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,480
in kind of hot code that needs to be you

431
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,140
know within less than 16 milliseconds

432
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,630
but not really you know sacrificing the

433
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,840
usability or the readability of the code

434
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,910
you know and also knowing that the we

435
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,110
want to make this available for kind of

436
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,460
novice developers really

437
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,690
you want to shield them from any

438
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,340
properties or methods that that might

439
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,649
break you know I I think a programmer

440
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,020
has a responsibility to its users

441
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,940
whether the users are you know throw a

442
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,260
graphical interface sort of touch

443
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,779
interface or these are people using your

444
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:55,299
library say you know I don't it's not up

445
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,039
to me to say oh you need to figure it

446
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,240
out and if you break it it's your fault

447
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,520
like if I can recover from a mistake

448
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,580
then great I'm going to do so so you

449
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,799
know artisan and the authors as the you

450
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,480
know as one target audience you know

451
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,149
like I said assume a code Academy you

452
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:13,720
know level of programming skill and you

453
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,580
know video compositing and being a video

454
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,070
artist is hard enough like that's plenty

455
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,580
hard and my demos are there just demos

456
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,090
they're not great stories so you know I

457
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,130
respect that that skill and that skill

458
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,750
should be the bottleneck I think if you

459
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,309
know if an artist comes to use this the

460
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,289
hardest thing they're doing is is the

461
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:35,890
art not not the programming right so we

462
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,669
do lots of input validation you know if

463
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,320
you're going to give me a set of color

464
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,539
as a parameter on something right like

465
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,159
you can give me the name of the color

466
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,690
you can give me a string that's red you

467
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,059
can give me an array of you know RGB

468
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,690
values you can give me a CSS you know a

469
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,480
hex color or a RGB function you know

470
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,130
we'll handle it all right and if you

471
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,750
give me if the numbers are out of the

472
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,820
you know out of the range that's okay

473
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,340
we'll cap it like we work for you so you

474
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,220
know there's polymorphism which tends to

475
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,770
you know it can be a little bit slower

476
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,659
but it's it's worth it and it's not

477
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:11,980
enough to make a difference in the frame

478
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,559
rate here and you know recovering from

479
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,059
bad input so if you give me something

480
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:18,850
that's ugly I'm going to try my best not

481
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,649
to crash and just give you something

482
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:24,159
right now on the other hand there's the

483
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,649
plug-in developers like I said building

484
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:29,470
shaders is really hard right so I assume

485
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,240
a much higher level of programming skill

486
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,610
so here we can kind of prioritize low

487
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,789
level access and efficiency and speed

488
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:40,809
and performance you know so it's it

489
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:42,940
enables you to kind of cover both

490
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,770
audiences and protect them both and I

491
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,179
just think it's important to kind of

492
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:46,650
know your

493
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,370
it's not weight is served in an that way

494
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,540
so what's it look like how do we use it

495
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,850
so like I said try to keep the API

496
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,830
pretty simple so we start with creating

497
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,060
this source node I'm not going to go

498
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,270
over too much code here so we create the

499
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,070
first thing as we create a new seriously

500
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,590
instance and that's your composition you

501
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,240
can access a video element just like you

502
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,490
have a team access any video element and

503
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,170
you create a source node by calling

504
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,480
seriously dot source that's it you've

505
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,140
got your source node pretty simple an

506
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,080
effect note very symbol similar right

507
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,850
you just we've already got our source

508
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,130
node right you carry a blur equals

509
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,770
seriously affect Direction blur so

510
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,420
you've got a string look up of all the

511
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,000
different effects in the library and

512
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
then you just kind of tweak the values

513
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,430
by just setting them on the object so

514
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,550
those are setters and getters and you

515
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,170
know they validate so you know if you

516
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,180
say blur amount and blur needs to be

517
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,430
between 0 and 1 and you give me you know

518
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,850
one and a half it just becomes one it we

519
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,530
try to be you know intelligent here and

520
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,640
make it easy um what else target note

521
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,070
right so target you always almost always

522
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,470
want to help put to a canvas you can

523
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,650
output to a byte array or a pixel you

524
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,970
know a pixel array or to an existing a

525
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,650
web GL texture but for the most part you

526
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,900
output directly to canvas you create

527
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,330
canvas that I put it in the in the DOM

528
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,520
and just create your target on the

529
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,330
canvas and the next step is to string

530
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,710
them all together right because we want

531
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,900
to create that node graph so you just

532
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,640
kind of connect your nodes by saying

533
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,430
blurred source is your source target

534
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,210
outsources your blur and then go so go

535
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,070
is pretty good so we have a couple of

536
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,210
options here for you how you actually

537
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,940
render so if you want to take any given

538
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,010
target node or the whole composition you

539
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,590
could just call target render right so

540
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,450
if you have a game loop for example and

541
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,130
you want to do other stuff in your game

542
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,870
loop and you want to use seriously j/s

543
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,930
as kind of the post-processing pass on

544
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,150
your game right you you're going to want

545
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,380
to run your own Trollope but you can

546
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,230
call it sir target render or you can

547
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,600
just say go and what go does go is great

548
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,370
because it then it monitors all of your

549
00:21:59,370 --> 00:21:59,800
source

550
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,180
all of your you know whether it's your

551
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,670
videos and images as they get connected

552
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,980
and disconnected or as they play and all

553
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,790
of your your inputs so back when I said

554
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:12,160
like you know blur amount is your point

555
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,410
eight if you want to animate blur all

556
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,050
you got to do is you change it to 0.7 or

557
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,450
something else and once you use go it'll

558
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,250
automatically redraw but it will not

559
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,960
redraw while that stuff is not changing

560
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,670
just to be an efficient so we could

561
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,470
there's also kind of an easier way like

562
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,690
I said polymorphism is really important

563
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,360
here so this is an example where we

564
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,600
create all their elements in in HTML in

565
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,510
the DOM and we can wire it up we can get

566
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm going to hide I want to highlight

567
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,200
the code here so instead of actually

568
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,570
creating a source node we can create our

569
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,120
chroma key node right there's a chroma

570
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,270
key example and just set source is the

571
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,850
string is the ID of the video and what

572
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,890
else is really cool so split is our

573
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,270
effect node which which i'm going to

574
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,550
show you in a second and you can just

575
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,220
link that up to an actual input element

576
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,590
and it will watch the input element for

577
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,330
you so it's really fast to create

578
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,640
interfaces on these things I think like

579
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,280
a if you were creating a final

580
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,800
production of a piece you'd probably

581
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,960
build your own interfaces or you'd have

582
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,830
things on you know animate over time and

583
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,660
interact other things but a lot of times

584
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,090
for experimenting you just want to you

585
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,150
know wire that up to a range slider and

586
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,100
go right so that's pretty cool that

587
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,600
works pretty well so here's what that

588
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,840
looks like right so here we got our

589
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,120
video of a dog right and I created two

590
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,060
so we split the input of our dog video

591
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,570
to two different nodes 1 which is the

592
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,000
chroma key node right and then one is

593
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,370
straight into the split right so right

594
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,350
now the split is set at zero so we can

595
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,520
just kind of move I don't know why my

596
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,010
dogs not playing well that's not good

597
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,850
there you go

598
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,320
there you go so we can just kind of drag

599
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,110
our split effect and it's got an angle

600
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,410
parameter on it right and then we can we

601
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,260
can make the edge fuzzy if we want to

602
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,630
just kind of drag that around so that's

603
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,340
it's a it's pretty easy if you just kind

604
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,920
of want to play with the effects and see

605
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,000
what works and it wasn't really very

606
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,640
much code and the dog just kind of

607
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,290
looped some plays and you know and he's

608
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,440
fine he's very happy so okay let's move

609
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,640
back over here all right so a couple of

610
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,640
tips just some things to be aware of if

611
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,450
you're using this first thing is

612
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,059
preprocessed what you can so you know

613
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,500
we're doing a lot of these processing

614
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,940
and you'll see some more options what

615
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,530
you can do is a lot of color effects and

616
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,190
things like that you know if you have a

617
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,809
color fact that's the same on every

618
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:56,760
video so every time you watch it if it's

619
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,040
the same there's no reason to process

620
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,929
that color effect in the person in

621
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:02,820
everybody's browser if you can cut you

622
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,919
know process I color effect in you know

623
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,809
in the actual video and burn it into the

624
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,640
video then great do that you'll save

625
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,970
some cpu cycles and you know and you

626
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,320
might even depending on what the effect

627
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,190
is you might even get a better output

628
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,140
next thing is don't forget about cross

629
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,710
origin restrictions videos need to be

630
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,700
for security reasons videos and images

631
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,919
they need to be in this either the same

632
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,630
origin or they need to have coors

633
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,980
headers on it it's a little bit of pay

634
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,630
the neck but you can do it so

635
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,520
unfortunately you can't just grab any

636
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,100
video out there on the internet and you

637
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,900
know process it you usually have to have

638
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,120
your own server or you know serve

639
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,290
somebody you know it's going to give you

640
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,669
access with those headers it's a little

641
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,290
bit pain in the neck but something to be

642
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:50,340
aware of yeah and generally want to keep

643
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,130
videos i find that 960 x 540 is about

644
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,020
the right size for the right upper limit

645
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,750
for videos so this is a this is a

646
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,090
macbook air it's two years old it's got

647
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,799
four gigs of ram if not anywhere near

648
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,110
like it's not a super fast computer

649
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,059
these days and you know we're running

650
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,440
these effects at pretty high frame rates

651
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,530
but the slowest thing that the

652
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,960
bottleneck tends to be the upload of the

653
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,450
video frame from the video element into

654
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,890
the GPU and once you get above 960 x 540

655
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,840
960 x 540 you can get your 60 frames per

656
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,210
second but past that it starts to slow

657
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,860
things down a little bit so just

658
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,720
something to keep it be aware of but if

659
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,669
you're doing still images or if you know

660
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:32,640
then feel free to go much bigger if

661
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,380
you're using if you know that it's going

662
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,150
to be your setting up like a kiosk or

663
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,559
something and you know that it's going

664
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,179
to be a really fast computer you can go

665
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,570
higher and that's that has actually

666
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,270
nothing to do with the file size because

667
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,700
the file size can be compressed so once

668
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,350
you're you know if you have if you have

669
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,240
compression on your video once you're

670
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,610
copying that from the GPU you know from

671
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,080
the video to the GPU that's already

672
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,910
uncompressed so your compression rate

673
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,120
makes a difference for the network

674
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,679
transfer like it would on any web page

675
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,740
but here the size is more important in

676
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,280
the pixels okay so moving on it's time

677
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,929
for some demos right let's get to the

678
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:13,500
good stuff okay um all right so i need

679
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,900
to give myself camera access hang on

680
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,080
thank you all right so all this stuff

681
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,240
works great with getusermedia hang on

682
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,720
there we go okay how are we doing all

683
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,300
right so one thing we can do is I showed

684
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,429
you that split effective before right we

685
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:31,620
do ourselves a good old Star Wars wipe

686
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,400
effect right to the fish well as a fish

687
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,559
video not playing I don't know that fish

688
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,610
video is supposed to be playing but

689
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,690
imagine it's playing and you know that's

690
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,030
that works back and forth it's a very

691
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,740
simple little effect you can do just

692
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,870
kind of replicate some of the stuff

693
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,659
we've seen in the cinema here's another

694
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,730
one oh this is fun this is an ASCII text

695
00:27:53,730 --> 00:28:00,630
effect that's pretty good and that works

696
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,760
on the fish to another Fisher move in

697
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,790
there you go alright so ASCII fish is

698
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,700
very important okay what else you got Oh

699
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,909
chroma key this is fun so this is um

700
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:14,130
this is a blue screen effect I was

701
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,210
telling you about I happen to have

702
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,720
behind me a great big blue screen and

703
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,990
yeah so that works so that's pretty good

704
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,669
so works for a blue screen green screen

705
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,740
and it was like

706
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,750
code for this is super short like I set

707
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,100
up the chroma key note i showed you

708
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,660
before and i'll have to do is set the

709
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,140
color from green to blue and it's a

710
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,360
pretty good effect it's um the some of

711
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,910
the demos that you see out there for the

712
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,340
2d canvas they do kind of this distance

713
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,140
model where they say all right I've you

714
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,520
know as long as my color is within a

715
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,410
certain range of my target color Wilkie

716
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,360
it out but this uses a little bit more

717
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,070
complicated model involving the

718
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,860
saturation of the the pixels loop or

719
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,140
high saturation and so it can even do

720
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,670
things like it can detect things like

721
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,520
glass that's semi-transparent so if I if

722
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,340
I had some you know there's I have

723
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,240
another video where there's a guy

724
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,530
blowing bubbles in front of a green

725
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,030
screen and you can kind of see the

726
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,950
bubbles and it extracts the green so

727
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,540
it's pretty cool and shadows and stuff

728
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,120
so that's pretty good definitely play

729
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,960
with that that's a big one for

730
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,460
compositing um what else oh yeah TV

731
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,929
glitch effect this is one of my

732
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:22,080
favorites we do a little channel change

733
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,550
hang on there you go so hop the TV

734
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,950
glitch effect this one this is my

735
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,780
favorite TV glitch i think is going to

736
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,480
be the page curl of a 21st century right

737
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,370
so I guys I want you all to go out there

738
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,650
and throw TV glitch affected everything

739
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,420
and it's great because we don't really

740
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,850
have TVs like this anymore and i love

741
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,770
how in movies they always have analog

742
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,290
you know TV glitch on digital signals so

743
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,929
go do lots of that that's good explore

744
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:53,790
it play with it um what else ok so this

745
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,620
is this is not actually affect this is a

746
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,940
thing this is a trend if you see those

747
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,670
movies this is a still from Transformers

748
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,990
7 or something I don't know

749
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,630
and they do this thing now where they

750
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,690
make all these movies they did it in it

751
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,640
did it in this hot tub time machine they

752
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,470
did it great movie they did an iron man

753
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,420
2 I don't have a picture that but you

754
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,070
notice these guys everything is either

755
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,400
blue or orange so they do this kind of

756
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,830
digital color timing the digital color

757
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,090
correction actually is interesting a

758
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,260
little bit of history that started with

759
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,000
some I think it was oh brother where art

760
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,250
thou was the first movie where they they

761
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,020
really just scanned in the whole film

762
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,700
into a computer and they digitally color

763
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,260
corrected it and now everything is

764
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,760
digitally color corrected and now

765
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,260
they're making everything to be blue and

766
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,760
orange and it's ridiculous and it's

767
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,850
terrible and you know you can do that

768
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,830
too so now I'm going to I'll show you

769
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,340
what it looks like I turn it on and off

770
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,660
so there's my skin it's all kind of

771
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,270
orange and the toggle it so that's it

772
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,370
off it's a subtle effect here it works

773
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,220
with the fish too right so that's what

774
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,740
the fish are supposed to look like and

775
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,220
here we get me make the orange pop so if

776
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,020
you want to explore that cliche also

777
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,640
please go do that maybe it could

778
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,830
probably use some TV glitch but I didn't

779
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,410
have time for that okay what else oh

780
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,730
yeah this is a fun one okay this one is

781
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,740
so this is an interactive video

782
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,510
experiment I played with this is a music

783
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,179
video I can't hang out have to do that

784
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:29,060
here I have to click the play button

785
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,909
okay so this is a video by the band okay

786
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:36,649
go so this I use for a color replacement

787
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:39,090
so okay goes great if you go to

788
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,429
seriously Jas org I have another demo

789
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:44,250
from Ok Go that I did they're great they

790
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,830
did the video the guys on the treadmills

791
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,840
if you don't know who they are and

792
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,100
they're just great to work with because

793
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,630
they make these really colorful videos

794
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,889
and they put it out there for you to

795
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:55,409
mess with so this is this kind of here

796
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:57,059
let me go back a little bit this

797
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,470
colorful video so I built this thing

798
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,480
where the more you move the mouse it

799
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,330
just kind of changes the color and it's

800
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,980
got a great little filter on it based on

801
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,440
kind of a range of hue and saturation so

802
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,159
it changes it excludes the skin tone and

803
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,120
kind of the ground and stuff and it only

804
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,159
filters out the wall so I built this

805
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,200
little demo where you have to keep

806
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,549
moving the mouse and the more you move

807
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:22,740
the mouse the more changes the color but

808
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,000
if you stop moving the mouse you don't

809
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,899
touch it it kind of fades out to grey so

810
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,879
this is kind of a little experiment and

811
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:33,000
and each scene as they change each scene

812
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,610
has a different kind of different kind

813
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,740
of settings on it so I use popcorn jjs

814
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,750
to create each scene and change the

815
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,250
settings on the hue/saturation node so

816
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,639
that's pretty cool so I like that uh so

817
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:50,100
what else yeah that one that was some of

818
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,330
these scenes it didn't work this one's

819
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,860
really hard because they're wearing

820
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,480
green and stuff behind them as green so

821
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,000
I couldn't figure that one out so what

822
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,240
else okay this is another one fun fun

823
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,860
one this is so this is just to show one

824
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,990
of the effects in the library is called

825
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,470
it's a repeat effect so you just you

826
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,870
give it what you do is you give it a

827
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,460
transform node that doesn't actually

828
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,230
have an input right you give it a video

829
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,590
input and you go to transform node and

830
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,509
you give it a number right and it takes

831
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:20,129
that transform node and it repeatedly

832
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:22,950
runs the transform on every no instance

833
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,490
so you know I've got a whole lot of Neil

834
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,250
deGrasse Tyson's here I don't know what

835
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,990
would happen if you try to make you

836
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,789
could do these transforms in CSS I

837
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:34,889
suppose I imagine that if you try to do

838
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:38,389
it and you had like what is it like 25

839
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:40,370
video elements

840
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,200
and tried to play them all at once and

841
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,480
keep them all in sync I imagine you

842
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,670
might run into trouble so this is a cool

843
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,770
thing you can do it seriously also just

844
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,450
if you notice if you look really

845
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,980
carefully at the bottom or at the top

846
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,770
when their heads overlap each other I've

847
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,780
got a luma key illuminance key effect

848
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,670
running on this luminous keys like green

849
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,500
screen but it uses if you have a bright

850
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,390
white background the keys that so

851
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,590
sometimes it is easier to find a bright

852
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,059
white background than it is to find a

853
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:08,030
perfectly lit green background so we get

854
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,320
a little transparency just a side note

855
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,629
well you have stuff like PNG which is an

856
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:16,429
image format that has an alpha channel

857
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,429
in it there is no video format that is

858
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,990
available on the web that can have an

859
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,190
alpha channel so if you ever want to

860
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,290
have an alpha channel on video you gotta

861
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:28,610
either use use a key like this or you

862
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,110
can we have another there's another

863
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,940
plug-in that's a channel mapping plugin

864
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,159
so you could use another video as the

865
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,490
alpha channel but on the demo that okay

866
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:42,110
so else oh oh yeah alright so this is

867
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,929
I'm showing off the blur this is

868
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,040
something I'm gonna try this is not

869
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,899
going to work so I have a blur plug-in

870
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:50,360
which I just got working which is so

871
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,040
you'll notice this is a really large

872
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,700
blur right a lot of the plot the blurs

873
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,890
you'll see in WebGL you kind of get like

874
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,270
a few pixels here and there and it's

875
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,790
really hard to get a high radius blur

876
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,970
this one works by successively blurring

877
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,380
and blurring and blurring and it scales

878
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,220
down the the textures so it's actually

879
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,200
the more you blur it the faster it is

880
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,870
which is weird I'm going to try this

881
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,660
this is not going to work hang on but

882
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,980
let's see let's see enhance

883
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:41,080
enhance enhance enhance okay um so so

884
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,060
this is it so you notice the blur

885
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,560
animates which is really cool when we

886
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,350
use the scaling of transform node I want

887
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,380
to apologize to Andy so Andy you guys

888
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,760
are all here but for the video I

889
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,620
couldn't get this to work yesterday the

890
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,840
trick Andy is to get it to respond to

891
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,370
any words you say so try that next time

892
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:04,900
oh my thing I can't believe that word

893
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,400
all right oh ok this was cool so this is

894
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,530
called a displacement map so if you ever

895
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,230
seen when they take a like a when they

896
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,540
shoot a movie in 2d and they converted

897
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,340
to 3d like what you know 3d movies are

898
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,580
huge right now and when you go to you

899
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,710
know they don't all shoot them in 3d

900
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,790
with two cameras a lot of them they

901
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,140
shoot them in 2d and they convert it

902
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,540
which is this miserable painful express

903
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,680
but the users thing called its

904
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,680
displacement map so this is I got a copy

905
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,240
of this displacement map from somebody

906
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,130
in the internet I didn't make it but

907
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,240
check this out what you can do with it

908
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,270
this is kind of crazy come on yeah so

909
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,710
get like a little subtle head movement

910
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:50,870
from Emma there um how creepy is that

911
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,350
I'm sure she would think so if she saw

912
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,350
it but I actually i was i was thinking

913
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,910
that if i didn't have time but I wanted

914
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,320
to wire this up to the Web Audio API

915
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,850
with a beat detector and have her doing

916
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,320
like you know

917
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,260
so next year next year so this is just

918
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,490
show you this is what the displacement

919
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,580
map looks like so the brighter the value

920
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,640
the more it displaces the pixels to the

921
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,730
left or the right or up or down so some

922
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,040
somebody on YouTube there's a link to

923
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,990
this tutorial there if you can probably

924
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,200
can't see it but like just paints this

925
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,690
by hand based on their his estimation I

926
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,190
tried to do it but it didn't really come

927
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,680
out very well so I borrowed his so

928
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,960
that's that's pretty neat oh I have

929
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,220
another example I think to show you but

930
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,130
you can if you can find a video that is

931
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,740
like a very still seen you could use

932
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,720
that to kind of do this in a video as

933
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,030
well and I kind of change angles in a

934
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,980
video or you know if you wanted to have

935
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,230
you know you could get Emma from two

936
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,880
different sides if you had like a 3d

937
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,220
screen which I don't unfortunately next

938
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,990
year oh okay oh yeah all right so

939
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,730
somebody once said to me if it doesn't

940
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,830
work on mobile it's not worth doing all

941
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,330
right let's see if I can get this to

942
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:16,619
work go on can I can you guys get zoom

943
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:20,730
in I didn't come close all right answer

944
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,420
it I brought my own hang on see if this

945
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,470
works camera

946
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,730
okay can you see that so this is a TV

947
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,290
glitch effect running it so this is

948
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:37,160
firefox on Android I'll get a little bit

949
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,690
more in a second about like what

950
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,300
platforms this works on but firefox is

951
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,210
pretty cool because it lets you hang on

952
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,190
it's creepy it's haunted right so if you

953
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,970
smack it like like an old TV here

954
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:56,960
respond and the creepy face is

955
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,180
interesting because it has a there you

956
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,990
go it has the light detector in the

957
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,760
phone so firefox mobile is really

958
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,350
awesome it gives you access to the

959
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,020
accelerometer and the brightness

960
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,810
detector and so the theory is with this

961
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,310
little toy like if you if you're

962
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,960
watching it and your lights are on it's

963
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,400
just an old TV and you gotta smack it

964
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,840
every so often but when the lights go

965
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,670
off it it goes crazy and it has that

966
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,290
scary face coming in now so kind of um

967
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:26,060
alright so I'll go I gotta hurry up here

968
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,580
see what else together okay what else ah

969
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,040
alright this is a couple of challenges

970
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,820
in dealing with the stuff especially

971
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,380
compared to traditional static

972
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,900
compositing I want to go over that so

973
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,070
WebGL is a pain in the butt why is that

974
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,900
their driver issues so you know

975
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,130
sometimes if you have an old driver

976
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,380
drivers that kind of definitely work

977
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,060
very well especially like on Linux

978
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,830
sometimes when you have open source

979
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,750
drive drivers that aren't really from

980
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,550
the manufacturer and kind of things

981
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,960
aren't always that good and you get

982
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,940
these like lost contacts things that

983
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,940
happen it's kind of hard old hardware

984
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,250
again like obviously there's less and

985
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,200
less of that as it go but it can be it

986
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:11,030
can be a snag for WebGL mobile yeah also

987
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,920
mobile devices are often slower so

988
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,740
sometimes you need to use like a lower

989
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,240
res version of your video for a mobile

990
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,460
device no Dom input that's also like so

991
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,370
you can use um like I said canvas and

992
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,920
images and video for your input textures

993
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,470
but unfortunately you can't use like

994
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,990
actual chunks of the web page there's a

995
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,690
library called HTML to canvas which is

996
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,700
pretty good but it's not really good for

997
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,430
animating so

998
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,240
you want to get like a one-off

999
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,160
screenshot of your image and then that's

1000
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,069
with that you can do that oh yeah and

1001
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:47,280
non power of 2 texture limits so WebGL

1002
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,579
really likes all of your texture sizes

1003
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,339
to be powers of 2 most people just don't

1004
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:56,309
shoot video and power of two textures so

1005
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:58,829
it there's some things you can't really

1006
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:00,420
do with scaling like if you were to

1007
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,309
scale it up it uses much smoother

1008
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:03,839
prettier scaling if you have power of

1009
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,349
two textures and there may one day be

1010
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:08,970
WebGL extensions for that but for right

1011
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,630
now it's just a minor pain in the neck

1012
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,040
platforms what platforms is available on

1013
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,829
so WebGL worked great on firefox and

1014
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:18,599
chrome those guys are awesome right and

1015
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,099
it just works like a like a dream right

1016
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:25,680
Safari technically has WebGL but it's

1017
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,960
disabled by default and it's super slow

1018
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,869
for videos so unfortunately like it's

1019
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:32,819
not really realistic or a Bible for this

1020
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:37,440
stuff um ie11 finally has WebGL which is

1021
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,359
great but it doesn't let you use video

1022
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,329
as a texture so you could do basic image

1023
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:44,250
processing for the stuff in ie11 it does

1024
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,040
work passes the unit tests awesome but

1025
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,569
for video I'm afraid it's kind of

1026
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:51,960
useless mobile Firefox and Chrome again

1027
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,410
ipad not going to happen as much as I

1028
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,700
would like them to do it they don't seem

1029
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,430
to be having an interest in that but

1030
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,750
again this is this is I consider this

1031
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,980
stuff is to be like pretty well out

1032
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,690
there so you know I'm kind of

1033
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,640
engineering for the not the lowest

1034
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,460
common denominator but but the highest

1035
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,130
video delivery compression artifacts so

1036
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:14,609
if you're um a like if you if you were

1037
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:16,290
working on a movie right like like Iron

1038
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,910
Man or something like that you would get

1039
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,190
the like raw uncompressed straight from

1040
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,920
the camera video but you know when

1041
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,970
you're drawn in green screen on

1042
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,559
something that's compressed with web M

1043
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,309
or mp4 you get some artifacts it's kind

1044
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:31,260
of a pain in the neck like I said text

1045
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,180
your uploaded GPU slow so the size is

1046
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,420
limited there's a seeking delay so

1047
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,160
there's not as it's not as easy you can

1048
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,990
modify the pixels it's harder to modify

1049
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,309
the time if you want to slow things down

1050
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,349
and speed them up that's I haven't

1051
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:45,140
really figured out how to do that yet

1052
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,570
but hopefully vp9 and all

1053
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,520
in the next I mean it could be a few

1054
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,290
years it's kind of out there but will

1055
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,000
should be higher quality video formats

1056
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,080
so maybe we can see some of those

1057
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,680
compression artifacts go away webcams

1058
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,500
suck they just don't have good color

1059
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,830
fidelity and they like to auto adjust

1060
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,050
their exposure and white balance so if

1061
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,490
you were to like have you know if you

1062
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,510
want to shoot something in front of a

1063
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,550
blue screen it might go oh your thing is

1064
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,740
tinted way to blue sorry we're gonna

1065
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,510
we're going to adjust it to white and

1066
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,780
then it just screws everything up what

1067
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,760
else unsupervised compositing really

1068
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,280
quickly again if you're you know working

1069
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,460
on Iron Man 3 and you're tweaking stuff

1070
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,960
you know there's a lot of manual work

1071
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,510
that goes into that you know they paint

1072
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,540
out wires and tracking markers you know

1073
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,100
they might they might do a green screen

1074
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,630
but like this part in the corner needs

1075
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,820
to be painted over if you're running

1076
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,620
this stuff on a webcam and you don't

1077
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,880
know what that's going to look like on

1078
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,910
the other end you can't do that so you

1079
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,080
just you just have to be aware of these

1080
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,880
things and work around it and realize

1081
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,080
that you know it's a much more

1082
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,180
unpredictable scenario and it's in some

1083
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,850
ways a very different art I'm run at a

1084
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,260
time here so I'm going to kind of

1085
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,180
breathe out what are we doing in the

1086
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,090
future more effects make them the API

1087
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,070
more at Short mature I want to have

1088
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,080
different kinds of sources as well as

1089
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,680
you know the videos and images Cheney

1090
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,060
knows an interesting idea to make it

1091
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,410
faster but a lot of time to talk about

1092
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:13,350
it when I build a graphical interface

1093
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,410
there's a guy working on that right now

1094
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,180
we did the no flow is a data flow

1095
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,230
project WebRTC this could be interesting

1096
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,310
getusermedia as you can see works now

1097
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,810
recording does not work yet there's a

1098
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,670
proposal for that that should be great

1099
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,490
and and eventually broadcasting

1100
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,840
canvassed appears so I'd love to see

1101
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,280
this you know if you're going to make

1102
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,060
like a web video show you know you could

1103
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,520
do that and broadcast that out what else

1104
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,130
very lastly I want to use this some i'm

1105
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,700
experimenting with some computer vision

1106
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,490
i'm going to skip this and on time but

1107
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,600
there's some stuff you can do to

1108
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,570
actually analyze the image as in

1109
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,330
parallel in the GPU it's really hard but

1110
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,620
you can do some cool stuff with it and

1111
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:58,910
this

1112
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,730
just the beginning the very first sample

1113
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,680
so this is a picture of a couple of guys

1114
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,140
are here they took it could probably use

1115
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,420
a little white balance correction so

1116
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,589
let's run a little white balance on that

1117
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:14,059
so yeah so we do an auto white balance

1118
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:16,730
so we can actually analyze the entire

1119
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,980
color of the photo and find you know

1120
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,270
what's the color correction that needs

1121
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,240
to be done and then just for fun make

1122
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,470
them look like they're in transformers

1123
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:28,160
because you know they need that that's

1124
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,990
about it what is all this for really

1125
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,970
quickly it works great as a simple

1126
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:35,270
effect library interactive cinema kind

1127
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,559
of like that example I showed you with

1128
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,109
the Ok Go video where you know you're

1129
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:42,160
taking cinnamon making an interactive

1130
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,930
browser-based editor sometimes you know

1131
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,609
a lot of times offline tools are better

1132
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:47,930
for editing images and video but

1133
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,579
sometimes which is easier you know to

1134
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:51,500
build a browser based out of your editor

1135
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,990
it can be delivered over the web you

1136
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,130
know so that's something that may come

1137
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,520
in the future somebody told me the other

1138
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,260
day they're building a desktop video up

1139
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,510
with this with node WebKit on

1140
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,400
accessibility this is really awesome a

1141
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,130
guy from the BBC who's an R&D department

1142
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:10,339
I don't time to show it to you but made

1143
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:12,380
an effect that for people who are

1144
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,529
colorblind it will process the color to

1145
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:17,240
make them stand out differently so the

1146
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,680
color blind people can see that stuff

1147
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,210
which is really cool i'm really excited

1148
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,690
about that it's pretty awesome um

1149
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:25,549
finally yeah i think this stuff is for

1150
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,230
real it's happening but it needs a lot

1151
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,299
of work it's a little bit of a new art

1152
00:46:29,299 --> 00:46:31,460
form so go out there and experiment with

1153
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,589
it and you know make lots of TV glitches

1154
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:35,450
and make stuff that sucks before it

1155
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,579
makes stuff that's good and please

1156
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:39,470
contribute uh you know I need I need

1157
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:42,619
patches i need bug reports lots of help

1158
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:45,079
it's on github it's all free check it

1159
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:48,260
out finally you know I think um this

1160
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,089
will let us go from you know like i said

1161
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:52,339
compositing is a big step up from cgi it

1162
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:54,559
lets us go from crappy movies like

1163
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:56,450
Lawnmower Man and tron to awesome movies

1164
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:01,700
like a lot more men and tron too so go

1165
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,559
out there and do it so thank you very

1166
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:12,030
