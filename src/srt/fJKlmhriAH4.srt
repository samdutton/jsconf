00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,519

good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,490
so this is nothing new we all have

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,439
encountered this some point in our

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,170
JavaScript coding so let me shed some

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,939
quick light on a good bad at the tricky

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,710
parts it's more to do with the tricky

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,919
parts don't go with the description

8
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,910
Brendan Eich thanks for giving us

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,239
JavaScript and from annoying pop-ups the

10
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,550
JavaScript has evolved come along a long

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,030
way all these two tickets it's easy to

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,739
understand so anybody new to programming

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,769
JavaScript is appealing because it has a

14
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:47,640
very broad appeal but none of us go put

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,010
our deeper dive into understanding and

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,089
that's why when we encounter we got

17
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:56,149
issues we start blaming JavaScript

18
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,339
instead let's try to understand more

19
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:01,350
about it let's embrace JavaScript with

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,040
love so quickly what we learn today it's

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,940
types and questions just two seconds to

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,250
go to this and let me know if you all

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,979
know the answers to this yes or no so

24
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,530
the second one is influenced by a talk

25
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,300
from last year's JS gone for you by

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,880
Demetrius the sin of JavaScript so

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,800
trying to shed light on how it works

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,170
quick the JavaScript types seven of

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,810
these symbol is a new one newly added in

30
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,170
es6 the good thing is typeof null is an

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,720
object all the others type of undefined

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,370
is undefined type of boolean is boolean

33
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,810
type of number is number type of string

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,330
a string type of object is object I have

35
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,670
a question

36
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,980
anybody which is the seven string value

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,630
that type of can return other than these

38
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,140
so our type of null is an object so

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,360
which means we have like seven return

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,200
values from type of which is the seventh

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,770
type of can return it's a function so

42
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,440
type of function is a function even

43
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,940
that's not our separate type type of

44
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,739
function gives a function what is type

45
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,450
of array it's an object yes next type of

46
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,430
type of 42

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,030
it's a string why because first type of

48
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,160
42 is a number number is a string and

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,260
type of number that string number is a

50
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,890
string so answer to this is strain yes

51
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,450
okay so quickly undefined versus

52
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,210
undeclared we have a which is undefined

53
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,800
which means it is declared but it's not

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,330
given a value which is undefined right

55
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,050
next be the second one B is not declared

56
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,390
at all but the message JavaScript Rose

57
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,730
is B is not defined but actually it is

58
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,910
undeclared not undefined quick one what

59
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,050
is the output of this undefined yes

60
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,490
because the return value is not defined

61
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,140
so functions without explicit return

62
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,140
value returns always undefined then we

63
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,930
have this numbers it's not only with

64
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,940
JavaScript it's with any language which

65
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,490
adopts the I Triple E 754 specification

66
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,180
quick one one of these is true

67
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,970
which one one is false one is true the

68
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,010
second one is true the first one is

69
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,520
false because it's because of the binary

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,800
floating-point calculation the first one

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
0.1 it's hard to we don't have a finite

72
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,600
representation of binary in

73
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,940
floating-point whereas it's easier

74
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,730
whichever fraction is approximately

75
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,380
power of two it's easier to represent

76
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,900
them in binary in finite floating space

77
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,790
so that is my second one is true now the

78
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,600
first one next what is nan nan means I

79
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,459
try to perform a mathematical operation

80
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,800
but failed and here is the failed number

81
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,739
result instead and nan is the only value

82
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,540
in JavaScript which isn't equal to

83
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,870
itself okay some more numbers in

84
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,670
JavaScript we have the infinity and the

85
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,090
minus infinity as well yes what is

86
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,160
infinity divided by infinity Matz don't

87
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,780
blame javascript for all this this is

88
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,970
because of I Triple E 754 specification

89
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,459
infinity divided by infinity can be

90
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,030
performed by max its nan not a number

91
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,669
some more numbers yes we have 0 + 0 + -

92
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,390
0 in JavaScript yes but + 0 + - 0 are

93
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,260
equal to each other

94
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,650
it's only nan which is not equal to none

95
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,780
yes we still need negative 0 if we sum

96
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,310
if you are doing some game programming

97
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,260
if you have two direction

98
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,390
left to right center point yes we need

99
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,620
to know which direction we are moving

100
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,720
some theory go and read about it but yes

101
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,990
that is plus 0 and minus 0 next we all

102
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,580
which we all hate to avoid it's

103
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,990
questions right something to know before

104
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,430
we do questions there's something called

105
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,630
two string yes

106
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,790
sometimes you might have got a JSON

107
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,090
object and then we when we try say a

108
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,860
promise returns a JSON and then we try

109
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,750
to output it sometimes we get the object

110
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,850
string and then we wonder why because

111
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,860
the object gets convert converted to its

112
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,240
two string and then that's why we got

113
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,940
the object to string here we have the

114
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,310
array a door to string is 1 2 3 and a

115
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,130
string then comes the number few things

116
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,160
about number two boolean yes in

117
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,960
JavaScript will do thing to know about

118
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,080
us there are like these faulty values

119
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,860
okay so these are the faulty values all

120
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:33,760
right okay just one quick

121
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:46,659
I said it right

122
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:49,560
okay oh right this is gonna be really

123
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,560
quick I want you to stop using react Jes

124
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,630
and being a developer is a bit like

125
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,960
being a lawyer if how are we going to

126
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,910
get these big books if we do stuff that

127
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,060
everybody can understand if you take six

128
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,090
days instead of six months to get to

129
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,310
grips with the codebase and that means

130
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,160
your firm can replace you it gets even

131
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,889
worse with immutable state and once you

132
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,960
have an object nothing can change it

133
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,099
what if if you don't have 37 different

134
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,110
things that can randomly change state

135
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,389
firing events when it rains on Tuesdays

136
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,910
except in Firefox your manager can

137
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,820
understand it your manager can do your

138
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:41,069
job testing without a browser if not

139
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,370
leaving a multi virtual machine selenium

140
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,380
test rig that takes three days to set up

141
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,229
and four days to run is not good if you

142
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:52,500
are paid by the hour and if you don't

143
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,229
believe me let's look at history there

144
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,120
are four people approximately in the

145
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,949
worlds that can write a send mail config

146
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:04,530
from scratch it looks like this these

147
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,250
people worked three days they had happy

148
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,199
lives they were rich and then people

149
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,680
came and invented axiom and postfix and

150
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,750
of those four people three an hour on

151
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,110
employees and two homeless

152
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,320
pause for a moment just read the slide

153
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,140
is important and so to help stop this

154
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,860
phenomenon um I helped organize the

155
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,920
Hamburg react self-help group which we

156
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,330
have about three sharings a month you're

157
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,070
all very welcome to come and join us um

158
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,710
and let's rid the world of this horrible

159
00:07:43,710 --> 00:08:04,350
framework okay I just is a style crawler

160
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,310
it's an automatic CSS crawler that'll

161
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,660
download like it'll download styles and

162
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,730
show you the like the main styles that a

163
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,700
site uses and it takes screenshots and

164
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,990
takes like the navigation in the main

165
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,900
like the main everything it's it's quite

166
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,670
easy to use the other awesome thing is

167
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,410
that everybody how everybody hates on

168
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,960
Phantom jeaious this does not use it and

169
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,910
I wanted to make sure people knew about

170
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,520
like our about nightmare because it's

171
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,980
amazing I'm not affiliated with it but

172
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:37,480
it's great

173
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:44,900
okay so nightmare example very simply

174
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,340
like it's a lot of this head up is the

175
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,900
same as phantom we can show the style

176
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,800
and that's going to open the page

177
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,130
pulling all these CSS analyze

178
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,010
screenshots okay good works I think

179
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,300
that's the first live demo I've seen

180
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,420
today that worked yeah so this is the

181
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,610
size it makes there's just pulling it in

182
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,880
from the site this is the main like the

183
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,740
CSS of the footer the header of the

184
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,260
background etc and then we have the main

185
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:22,160
colors that are all based on

186
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:28,829
they're all off-screen yeah somebody

187
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:32,040
pulls in these and it bases the colors

188
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,170
off these with a nifty little NPM

189
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:39,000
library and yeah that's pretty much

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,269
about it actually we're actually using

191
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:45,629
it for and where I work for embedding

192
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:47,579
magazines because we embed them in other

193
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:48,930
people's sites and so we need to know

194
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,509
exactly what their what their page looks

195
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,370
like and so we can take that and

196
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,899
automatically pull in their styles to

197
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,069
apply them to our to our embedded things

198
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:01,589
and yeah it's cool check it out it's a 9

199
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:02,069
p.m.

200
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,379
also check out check out nightmare cuz

201
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,990
it's way way way better than phantom Jas

202
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,980
and it's based on electron I believe

203
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:20,730
yeah okay hello my name is Michelle with

204
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,089
one L and I wanted to know why aren't

205
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,689
you giving talks yet it's because you

206
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:29,279
have a whole bunch of excuses so we're

207
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,259
going to go through and knock them all

208
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:34,230
out so you don't have any more excuse

209
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,569
number one you think oh I don't have

210
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,660
anywhere to speak that's not true there

211
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,459
are tons of speaking opportunities for

212
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,050
you I'm sure whatever city you live in

213
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,990
there's tons of meetups you can find

214
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,149
coding workshops where usually they have

215
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,449
beginners and that's a really good low

216
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,879
low pressure place to get started you

217
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,470
can go to conferences you can go to

218
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,540
unconferences and there's a range of

219
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,430
lengths from lightning talks to 20

220
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,680
minutes 30 minutes hour long there's

221
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,350
something for everybody

222
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,759
maybe you think oh people are gonna

223
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,279
judge me

224
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,680
no actually brains are really forgiving

225
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,540
of speak people make mistakes all the

226
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,899
time when you're talking and our brains

227
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,120
just correct them and additionally

228
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,459
people don't care as much as you think

229
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,890
they care you're

230
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,930
it's true you're judging yourself a lot

231
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,310
more harshly than everyone else is

232
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,760
judging you maybe you think oh people

233
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,220
are just natural born speakers speaking

234
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,370
well just comes naturally to some people

235
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,860
false it's just like any other skill you

236
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,640
practice it may be some people have some

237
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,410
more natural talent than others it

238
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,000
doesn't matter anybody can practice and

239
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,580
get better when I first started giving

240
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,770
talks I actually practiced my talk at

241
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,900
home to myself in the shower and then in

242
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,280
front of the mirror so I could see what

243
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,810
I looked like and what weird things I do

244
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,440
with my hands you just practice maybe

245
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,120
you think oh I'm not an expert in

246
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,790
anything I can't give a talk that's not

247
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,390
true you are qualified to give a talk on

248
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,350
many topics right now exactly as you are

249
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,580
additionally even if you are an expert

250
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,770
in something a talk is really not the

251
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,720
best format to showcase that you

252
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,250
probably want to do some kind of longer

253
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,350
in-depth article or book or something

254
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,610
maybe you think you have to be a people

255
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,570
person to be a good speaker guess what

256
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,610
introverts can make great speakers

257
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,450
additionally it makes it really easy

258
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,220
when you go to a conference or any kind

259
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,870
of social event if you're not really

260
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,610
great at going up to people and starting

261
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,410
conversations yourself if you give a

262
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,360
talk it gives people a reason to come

263
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,130
over to you and then if you're tired of

264
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,150
interacting you just go hide it's fine

265
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:49,200
maybe you're too scared guess what there

266
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,630
are two types of speakers those that are

267
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,630
nervous and those that are liars

268
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,850
said by Mark Twain if you can

269
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,760
comfortably hold a conversation you can

270
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,210
give a talk furthermore the body's

271
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,430
reaction to fear and excitement is the

272
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,130
same so it becomes a mental decision am

273
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,250
i afraid or am i excited it's just in

274
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,550
your head okay now we're past all that

275
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,620
maybe you think oh I don't have anything

276
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,510
to talk about

277
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,420
well the average person says 15,000

278
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,730
words a day you have something to talk

279
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,850
about I'll give you some ideas maybe you

280
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,770
want to talk about a problem you solved

281
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,510
that's always interesting for people to

282
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,940
hear anything that makes you feel

283
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,220
feelings if you're passionate about

284
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,120
something

285
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,589
well like listening to you talk about it

286
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:40,680
you can compare to unlike things that

287
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,020
you enjoy maybe you have a background in

288
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,210
something non-traditional and you can

289
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,380
find a way to compare that to

290
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,480
programming for example or some specific

291
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,140
thing you can tell a story people read

292
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,600
books they play games they like to hear

293
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,230
stories a topic that you want to learn

294
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,540
more about maybe you decide you want to

295
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,880
learn more about a topic so you can give

296
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,060
a talk about it and also the topic

297
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,820
doesn't have to be unique you can put

298
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,230
your own individual spin on something

299
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,060
okay you don't know how to write a

300
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,670
proposal it's just your elevator pitch

301
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,380
it's exactly what everybody did in the

302
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,000
morning here just make it really short

303
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,540
why do people want to listen to it maybe

304
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,650
you think you must have the entire

305
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,450
presentation ready before submitting the

306
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,060
proposal no you can propose a talk

307
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,680
before even thinking about how you would

308
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,060
present there's always a bit of time

309
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,500
you'll have time to prepare from the

310
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,529
time it gets accepted maybe you think oh

311
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:36,420
I don't know any other speaker tricks

312
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,320
guess what just fake it till you make it

313
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,000
let yourself make mistakes you'll get

314
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,550
better as you go also you can ask other

315
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,800
speakers for help and now you're

316
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,420
thinking oh it doesn't matter it would

317
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,430
just be a waste of time no you get to

318
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,020
share your knowledge gain deeper

319
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,300
understanding of a topic go cool places

320
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,060

322
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:02,550

323
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,230
helped organize Berlin jeaious it's

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,920
you thank you

328
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:25,680
you

329
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,420
okay so my presentation is based on my

330
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,730
last nine months or so working as a

331
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,980
junior developer so it's basically how

332
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,660
to help juniors especially those who are

333
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,770
not coming with a computer science

334
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,130
background so first of all hire them I

335
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,910
am on so many slack channels email

336
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,880
groups Facebook groups for juniors like

337
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,790
juniors are awesome women in tech and

338
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,900
it's great when you get a story like

339
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,970
yeah I forgot my first junior developer

340
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,850
job but it is actually very rare in

341
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,190
these groups but before you decide to

342
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,870
hire them you have to ask yourself some

343
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,820
questions you have to figure out am I

344
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,250
prepared to support a junior so that

345
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,280
they're successful at my company so

346
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,130
first I would ask myself in your

347
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,170
position in addition to having the money

348
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,210
to pay a junior developer do I have the

349
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,950
human resources and capabilities to

350
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,520
support them so how many hours per week

351
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,690
can my team support the dream developer

352
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,270
am i able to actually have this

353
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,970
structured in place an issue that I've

354
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,100
experienced and other junior developers

355
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,930
that I know have experienced is that

356
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,910
they're offered help but it's not built

357
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,240
into the bi-weekly sprints or the

358
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,430
workload so it ends up being you have a

359
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,670
question and it can be or you have

360
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,290
something that you to learn it'll be

361
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,300
addressed when there's time or when this

362
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,890
projects done and before the next

363
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,690
project and that's not a great

364
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,610
environment to learn in the other

365
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,220
question to ask yourself is are you

366
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,320
willing to require teaching is part of a

367
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,790
developer role when you're hiring mid

368
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,460
and senior develop level developers I

369
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,550
often see ads that say like must like

370
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,690
ping pong must be willing to go on fun

371
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,390
trips I think that if you're able to put

372
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,830
that in a job description you should

373
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,170
also be willing to ask for teaching as a

374
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,760
skill from your senior level developers

375
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,460
you should also ask yourself how do your

376
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,780
current does your current team

377
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,480
communicate are they doing pair

378
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,070
programming are they doing code reviews

379
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,380
are they talking every morning about

380
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,330
things they work on if you don't already

381
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,420
have a culture of open communication

382
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,680
it's going to be really hard for your

383
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,940
junior developer if you'll come

384
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,640
able to ask questions and ask for help

385
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,100
also when you're usually in a when

386
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,260
you're in a open communication culture

387
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,570
you usually have the language to explain

388
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,070
things as much as I've I've experienced

389
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,660
also senior developers who have a really

390
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,460
good intent in teaching me at workshops

391
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,840
and other things but it becomes very

392
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,790
clear to me when they do not have the

393
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,110
experience to put the training in

394
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,970
because they do not use words that I

395
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:07,270
understand and yes so why should you put

396
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,340
all this in place like what it sounds

397
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,720
like a lot of work why am I gonna do

398
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,820
this to higher juniors well first I want

399
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,010
to ask do any of you have like a super

400
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,020
easy time filling open positions at your

401
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,700
company if you do raise your hand okay

402
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,350
so basically everyone won't senior

403
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,810
developers you know people have mastered

404
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,060
their craft well they don't come out of

405
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,850
nowhere they have to learn and lots of

406
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,920
times they say well you know we're just

407
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,930
starting we want it to be really good at

408
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,580
first have money and then we'll hire

409
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,010
juniors but you're putting it off often

410
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,680
like on teams when they say this isn't

411
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,030
the ideal way that we want to build this

412
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,410
project but we'll just refractor it

413
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,270
later the costs are gonna be much higher

414
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,030
if you keep putting it off the others is

415
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,580
the other benefits hiring juniors is

416
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,100
that if you yeah if you make your

417
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,770
developers teach what they know they'll

418
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,390
have to do a lot of self-reflection

419
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,160
they'll have to think about what do i do

420
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,440
how do I do it and that would be really

421
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,290
beneficial for your work going forward

422
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,440
the other is that I've I've met

423
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,850
mid-level and senior level developers

424
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,820
who do lots of daily tasks that they

425
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,750
think pulls them away from work that

426
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,910
could make the product better so think

427
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,040
about how you can delegate these kind of

428
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,310
more simple tasks and Delic and hire

429
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,790
junior to do them the other is you won't

430
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,850
have as hard of a time thinking about

431
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,860
your tech stack if you're hiring a

432
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,470
junior and you can tell that they are

433
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,810
interested in learning and our have a

434
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,220
way of thinking that works with your

435
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,560
team your tech stack will be their text

436
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,760
deck and you won't have to worry about

437
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,910
that no yep so that's basically best way

438
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,830
to hire held

439
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,720
yours is hire them and support them

440
00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:00,470
thank you

441
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,850
yes oh no my voted for my talk I

442
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,630
proposed so I dig into it and force you

443
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,160
to see it because I think this is

444
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:22,510
important and this wasn't the first

445
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,020
slide as I start here so commit messages

446
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,120
please stop writing commit messages

447
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,320
please I want to give you a brief

448
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,600
introduction commit message formats at

449
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,520
the example of the angular can one

450
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,560
commit message format but you can apply

451
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,140
all what I'm saying - any other commit

452
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,430
message format it doesn't really matter

453
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,180
so yeah - TX bla bla I work at gym no

454
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,220
please

455
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,600
yeah we have we're hiring um so this is

456
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,760
the commit lock you can see it but you

457
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,460
will get inside this is commitment lock

458
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,920
of a project that had been founded by 25

459
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,240
million past year we have something like

460
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,040
update test and I wondering what are the

461
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,720
unit tests was it an a/b test

462
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,360
why hasn't been updated was it broken

463
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,640
before or is it even better now I don't

464
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,170
know

465
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,910
yeah good commit review what has been

466
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,070
reviewed what was the outcome of the

467
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,230
review and why has it been reviewed I

468
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,120
don't know

469
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,470
use proper domain well it's this domain

470
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,600
want to you do we want to use this why

471
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,960
does it affect me I don't know

472
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,060
we have commits like change the extra

473
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,730
the lower dimensions and I wanna - what

474
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,000
where they changed why and do we have an

475
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,540
extra level dimensions I don't know

476
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,350
compress it hard but stay sexy

477
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,380
compressed what why and is compressing

478
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,620
unsexy we don't know that

479
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,150
yeah so adding more classes you you get

480
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,480
the idea and we can do better than that

481
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,040
like we're the angular angular commit

482
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,010
message format so the idea is to have

483
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,320
this as your subject line you have a

484
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,380
type a scope and a subject for example a

485
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,400
commit message like feature JSON Kampf

486
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,190
2016 set up an epic conference so we can

487
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,610
see yeah let me dig into that so the

488
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,060
type is about what am i doing I can do a

489
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,490
back fix I can add a new feature I can

490
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,110
write documentation and there are more

491
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,470
types you can read that up if you want

492
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,850
to the scope is about where I'm on doing

493
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,730
it so I can fix the image editor or the

494
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,100
profile picture okay I can update the

495
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,040
dogs and the readme and then we have a

496
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,910
subject and that's about how am i doing

497
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,850
it so basically that's your formal

498
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,760
commit message what you used to what you

499
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,160
used to write and now it is in the

500
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,560
context of a type in the scope yeah so

501
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,720
the benefits of this there are there is

502
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,290
more to it

503
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,570
YUM there are guidelines about how to

504
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,700
write proper body to a commit message

505
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,320
and what's how to write a future where

506
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,250
you where you fix your issues or maybe

507
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,890
write something about how that would how

508
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,330
the commit has been reviewed or

509
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,820
something I won't go into that so the

510
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,610
benefits of these one line is your

511
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,950
commit logs are much more easy to browse

512
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,400
and me personally for me it helps to

513
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,260
write smaller commits and single purpose

514
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,470
commits and the big feature of it is

515
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:43,520
it's machine readable I will go to this

516
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,590
I think there's not readable and you can

517
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,930
see the angular for exemplary angular

518
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,640
good luck to see examples and this is

519
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,830
good for something like automatic change

520
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,040
lock creation and there is a project

521
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,690
named conventional change lock and

522
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,460
basically what it does it takes a commit

523
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,930
lock and positive and to MD file into a

524
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,960
human readable format so I don't have to

525
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,620
write any commit locks changelogs myself

526
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,570
they are just auto-generated out of my

527
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,100
commit message looks like this so

528
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,590
basically this is just a commit like fix

529
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,510
the commit of the type fix at the pass

530
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,300
and then the message or we have a commit

531
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,910
of the type feature with a scope cue and

532
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,660
then the message or we have a commit

533
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,910
message like performance at the compile

534
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:44,550
and you get it so there is something

535
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,890
like automatic version releases the

536
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,270
project yeah our ten seconds you

537
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,060
basically can do really cool stuff you

538
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,190
can automatically determine which

539
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,040
version you need to update based on your

540
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,350
commit message you there are choose that

541
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,730
can help you write better commit

542
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,250
messages like committed sin and it's not

543
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,610
that hard if you just invest some time

544
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:20,039
and my time is expired thank you

545
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:23,899
you see what happened there I just

546
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,029
plugged it in a network it's because I'm

547
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:28,580
using a proper operating system and I'm

548
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,419
probably the first guy not using a mixer

549
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:36,019
for everyone who is my talk des moines

550
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:37,460
in this morning I have to talk about

551
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,320
hacking games and I actually missed one

552
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,840
game by Google yeah you all know this

553
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,799
little page here

554
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,289
oh no we're offline maybe not all of you

555
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:46,730
know that this actually is a game you

556
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,489
can click it and then the still t-rex

557
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:52,669
starts running and there's obstacles and

558
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:54,440
you have to jump them and if you fail

559
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,419
you have to try again it this actually

560
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:58,480
will sound like a peep every time you

561
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,629
reach more than the score of 100 so what

562
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:09,269
can you do here

563
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,600
Google was very clever about it actually

564
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,559
and if you just open the so you don't

565
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,940
see any scripts in - every batch you

566
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,389
just see this data thing and that's not

567
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:28,429
the right one sources that is not the

568
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:31,999
right file and if you have to reload

569
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:46,320
alright because sometimes it's not

570
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,850
what do then is alright alright it's not

571
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,900
the game yeah

572
00:26:50,900 --> 00:27:00,500
and now what okay that I didn't expect

573
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,060
but I have three minutes to fix it since

574
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:18,420
I have more time alright

575
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,080
maybe they fixed it because they knew

576
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,720
about me so I just explained you what's

577
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,310
happening here usually you have the

578
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,040
index.html and you see nothing like I

579
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,420
see here but actually there's only one

580
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,120
line but and they hurt him HTML file I

581
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,000
tried it with you had to scroll down for

582
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,120
like 1500 lines they were all empty and

583
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,460
then the code started to appear and then

584
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,170
you scroll a little bit further and you

585
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,730
suddenly find the update function in the

586
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,050
update function there's actually a

587
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,360
little check if there's a collision if

588
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,190
you just comment that block out you'd

589
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,540
have to do you don't have to do anything

590
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,160
at all just keep them running all the

591
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,990
way all the time and get the points and

592
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,340
be happy and share the screenshots with

593
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:03,350
your friends and yeah use Ubuntu

594
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:14,799
you

595
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:28,500
you recognize that hopefully so yes

596
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,090
that's an Arduino basically and my dear

597
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,639
friend here has talked about how to hack

598
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:39,179
the krob Dino on the Chrome browser I

599
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,970
don't like you I will try to show you in

600
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,220
four minutes and 46 seconds how do you

601
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,269
hack the chrome Dino in Arduino little

602
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:49,889
web browser of course because this is a

603
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:53,370
J as conference after all so this is a

604
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,350
project I've been working on know

605
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,429
TweetDeck but it's called cloudy boy

606
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:02,549
which is basically an older boy compiler

607
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:07,049
for for for the cloud all the boy is

608
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,320
basically an Arduino microcontroller

609
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,990
built with a screen a little screen and

610
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,970
some buttons so you can play games with

611
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,039
it and you could code your own games in

612
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,990
like C or C++ so we have this website

613
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,990
that packs all that up into a simple web

614
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,260
browser session and what it also has so

615
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,419
you might see that I have this ruff

616
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,990
puppy maker this is my session ID which

617
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,139
I won't be able to use because I don't

618
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:41,159
see my screen here okay that might be a

619
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:50,380
problem let's try it this way

620
00:29:50,390 --> 00:30:01,590
and let's try this okay it worked which

621
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,630
is a good thing so I'm gonna hook this

622
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,230
up this is an electronic Legation that

623
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,020
basically only does one thing it flashes

624
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,300
your Arduino compiled code you don't you

625
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,620
onto the Arduino this is a basic web

626
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,400
connected stuff so I say my key code is

627
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,510
rough papi

628
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:31,680
maker hopefully this will work okay it

629
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,030
connected let me see if I can flush this

630
00:30:36,030 --> 00:31:15,250
stuff on the device if okay

631
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:21,450
okay this demo bakes our brakes every

632
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:27,210
five minutes Oh Oh Shh okay I just hack

633
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:32,310
it so we get the D no I think I know

634
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,740
what the problem is let's make it a

635
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:46,380
dragon yeah I like dragons better so

636
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,590
they're just dead it did update the code

637
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,290
for it so if you ever seen something

638
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,200
like that the code looks like that when

639
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,970
you compile it for the Arduino so now

640
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:04,200
hopefully and we'll see if I can get it

641
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,970
to work

642
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:27,049
yeah it's the USB

643
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:37,710
on

644
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,480
oh and you don't know don't see it

645
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,149
because it's not connected to the camera

646
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:55,629
oh yeah so okay actually now this time

647
00:32:55,629 --> 00:32:58,999
is going to work

648
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:02,139
twenty seconds let's see if I can make

649
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:08,470
it in time things whatever flame because

650
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,080
I still have ten seconds

651
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:16,059
yes save let's see if it compiles it

652
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,870
compiled let's see if I can flash it it

653
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:26,320
can flash it it downloads and you don't

654
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,740
see it why I don't see it I don't know

655
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:40,970
why I don't see it but it's on there

656
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,309
okay okay I want to give you a short

657
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:48,129
talk about rlea a new SPI framework

658
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:51,820
comparable to angular in sorts and let's

659
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,269
start right off I hope you can see it

660
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:57,450
this is the github page for irelia and

661
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,769
specifically for the skeleton navigation

662
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:02,409
that is a startup project that already

663
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:05,049
billed us you how we hope you can see it

664
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:09,819
a skeleton in different versions we for

665
00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:13,480
es2016 and three for typescript and you

666
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,569
just set up to work with normal text

667
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:20,109
editor asp.net 5 or with web pack

668
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:24,099
included for bundling and let's jump

669
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,020
right into the skeleton and I can show

670
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,629
you a bit how or relay is built oh

671
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:32,200
really it's a modular framework that

672
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,710
means it's not

673
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,869
monolith but you have many small

674
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:38,419
packages you can pretty much compared to

675
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:40,069
the net phone book if you're familiar

676
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:44,230
with it and all these packages have

677
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,419
mostly one responsibility and they are

678
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,629
meant for maximum reusability so you can

679
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:52,550
combine different aspects of the

680
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,379
framework to get really a full framework

681
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:56,089
out of it but you don't need to use

682
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:59,089
everything you can use what you want out

683
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:01,910
of that framework this starter project

684
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,339
delivers many things you'd expect from

685
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:08,720
it you have a test site that has some

686
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,760
basic features you have guard tasks

687
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,250
built into it to watch it for example

688
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,339
and that's exactly what I do know the

689
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:19,130
type guard watch it starts a build

690
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,920
process what a whole thing which is

691
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,460
built in the skeleton navigation and it

692
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,930
starts a web server where you can

693
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:35,119
inspect it takes a little yes and if I

694
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,849
go to localhost port 9000 then we see

695
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:40,569
this sample application where you can

696
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:42,829
take a look at the data binding engine

697
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:57,020
already offers you can you can take a

698
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,069
look at a router which also can do that

699
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:11,109
infinitely in itself and ok no problem

700
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:14,540
let's look here because here happens the

701
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,069
magic mostly is convention over

702
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,720
configuration which means you have a

703
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,049
mvvm sort of pattern you have a

704
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:23,359
JavaScript file which is really plain

705
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,410
JavaScript in year 6 and some part 7 and

706
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,880
you have a template that is a HD

707
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,960
file and they both repair a module and

708
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,350
you have really strictly separated the

709
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,780
market from the cold that and the logic

710
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,510
that belongs to the market they are

711
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,520
coupled by data binding and that binding

712
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,740
is a really flexible way to decouple

713
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,620
your your code because you can

714
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:55,050
declaratively display all your values

715
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,080
from a view model or you can also give

716
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,850
values from your inputs to the view

717
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:09,030
model to to do stuff with it and as long

718
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,440
as I hoped

719
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,730
okay the data binding engine the cool

720
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,500
thing about this is it's really simple

721
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,050
you don't need to know very much you

722
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,330
couldn't basically take every HTML

723
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,310
attribute that we can find anywhere in

724
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,010
your code and if you typed up bind

725
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,880
that's enough that takes already a semi

726
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,730
binding it can be two-way one way or one

727
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,590
time for inputs it's to two-way so in

728
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,320
both values in both directions the value

729
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,050
can flow for every other thing it's one

730
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,920
way because you have no input and with

731
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,560
that in mind I want to show you a really

732
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,870
cool example to finish this off its how

733
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,670
powerful the data binding engine really

734
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,200
is I have another project here and it

735
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,920
has not only disturb bind but it also

736
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,740
has another syntax because you can swap

737
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,510
the syntax you can teach the framework

738
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,060
to use another binding syntax to do what

739
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,130
you already wanted to do and in this

740
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,740
example here I have the angular syntax

741
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,380
you can see that in the double brackets

742
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,970
here below and enclose in it I also have

743
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,580
to knock out syntax a bit older maybe

744
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,560
some of you know it and if I go to

745
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:44,640
example already have it running that's

746
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,180
this one it is past the code and it

747
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,770
performs the data binding you don't need

748
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:58,500
to believe me blindly I started another

749
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:07,200
time just to show you that's really the

750
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:20,850
part I was visiting so that's it thank

751
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:31,890
you yeah hello I'm sorry from the last

752
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,140
funny you all tired but I just want to

753
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,210
talk about about the game The Binding of

754
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,080
Isaac

755
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,320
if you it's not about that actually but

756
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,330
okay so if you don't know this game you

757
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,200
should check it out it's really awesome

758
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,170
and I just spend some time like on my

759
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,300
free time to kind of make you a small

760
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,010
replica in JavaScript because it's

761
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,520
awesome

762
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,980
and so that guy called the issue like

763
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,650
shamelessly The Binding of Isaac

764
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,080
oh I'm I'm gonna wait anyway and so

765
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,700
like you just be we canvases and images

766
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,810
and like venue JavaScript for fun and so

767
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,280
like he doesn't have any like procedural

768
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,490
it dungeon mechanism or anything yet but

769
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,870
it just I just wanted to share and uh

770
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,400
and play around in front of people

771
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,630
because it's funny and so you can shoot

772
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:25,870
right
