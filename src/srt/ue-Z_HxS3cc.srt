1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,969

okay oh so this is the family portrait

2
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,509
from CSS Kampf us just a few months ago

3
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,390
it's so exciting to be here I can I can

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,010
hardly believe that it's actually

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,980
happened in May we had the first-ever

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,670
CSS comp in Amelia Island Florida paired

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,550
with Jay s Kampf us just like this is

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,009
paired with well you guys have so many

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,300
events here right now I don't know which

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,860
one is paired with but particularly I

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,860
guess joyous coffee you and it's just

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,170
really cool with a ton of help from

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,260
other people I organized the CSS conf in

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,899
the US and so just having this happen at

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,980
all is kind of amazing

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,629
one thing Christina asked me when we

17
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,270
were talking about this early on was why

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,510
did I do it and I said basically that

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,149
I'd been to lots of conferences

20
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,289
JavaScript conferences where everybody

21
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,640
was really nice to me and I had a really

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,899
good time but they thought I was a

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,840
designer and then I went a lot to a lot

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,640
of design conferences where again

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,140
everybody was really nice to me but they

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,869
thought I was a giant nerd and I was

27
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,580
like wait a minute CSS keeps falling

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,740
through the cracks right it's sort of

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,740
getting lost in the space between design

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,140
and development and maybe it needs its

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,080
own conference that can have enough love

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,000
I found myself wanting to meet other CSS

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,640
developers face to face I wanted to

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,380
basically look at people who loved see

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,540
it well let's be honest loved and hated

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,689
CSS just as much as I did right and and

37
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,579
so the way to do that was to create a

38
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,060
conference and that's the way that CSS

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,460
conf was originally born and very

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,229
luckily indeed right there you can see

41
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,930
I've circled it in red christina was in

42
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,570
the audience that day and she came back

43
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,360
to Berlin and together with Michael they

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,390
decided that CSS conf needed to come

45
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,729
here too there needed to be a Berlin

46
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,270
version and a Europe version of CSS conf

47
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,369
so I'd love to start off actually before

48
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,020
we even begin the day by giving them a

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:16,270
round of applause

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,230
they've worked so hard to get this day

51
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,090
to happen and to tie up all the details

52
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,190
and to make the breakfast as yummy as it

53
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,959
was and to get the parties to be fun and

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,239
to coordinate with the other events so

55
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,650
that we could meet people from the

56
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,700
different things that are happening

57
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,360
across Berlin so I want to talk to you a

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,739
little bit about how the talks were

59
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,840
chosen today I know that they they've

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,950
mentioned it a little bit there was a

61
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,599
blog post but I know that I missed the

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,280
blog post so I wanted to share that with

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,480
you the CSS community has sort of an

64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,769
excellent history of curation but CSS

65
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,379
conf and for CSS Kampf Michael and

66
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,970
Christina really wanted to balance that

67
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,459
with community and so that's why they

68
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,680
had a call for speakers and that's why

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,810
the first level of speaker selection was

70
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,150
completely blind they had no idea who

71
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,920
the proposals were from no identifying

72
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,109
details they were choosing a hundred

73
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:09,150
percent based on how great the proposal

74
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,829
sounded and how much they wanted to see

75
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:14,220
those people speak here today and the

76
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,810
thing that that means is that next year

77
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,220
well you know while this year you're

78
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,840
attending next year it could be you

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,209
standing up here giving one of the talks

80
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:22,919
about some cool new project that you've

81
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,900
been doing throughout the year also be

82
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,400
thinking about that be keeping that in

83
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,709
your mind today like what are you doing

84
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,120
that someone would really love to hear

85
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,190
about they had an incredible amount of

86
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,349
proposals and I hope that they get even

87
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,549
more next year so I have to say as well

88
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,060
I love the lineup that they've chosen

89
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,049
looking through it the speakers are

90
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,449
doing some amazing work they are

91
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,519
challenging preconceived ideas and

92
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,930
pushing the boundaries of what's even

93
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,609
possible with CSS

94
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,169
sometimes they're breaking stuff in

95
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,290
order to learn and see how it can grow

96
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,400
I've been really looking forward to

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,989
hearing Peter talk about web components

98
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,690
and shooby talk about how Google is

99
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,569
handling their module system I'm pretty

100
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,519
sure that mike is going to completely

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,930
blow us away with his talk about

102
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,750
security vectors and CSS itself I know

103
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,120
just a tiny bit about that and I seems

104
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,980
almost impossible so I'm really excited

105
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,430
to see how that's gonna make me learn

106
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,709
something haven't thought about before

107
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,359
and for Anna's Maria's talk I'm just

108
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,710
hoping to keep up if I can even

109
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,030
understand what she's talking about I

110
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,520
think that'll be fantastic so I think

111
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,140
that you're gonna like their topics just

112
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,860
as much as the organizers do

113
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,620
and really curious to get into the day

114
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,890
and see how that goes so to ask you a

115
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,390
quick question why are you here and

116
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,800
answer it really quickly was I have no

117
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,240
idea while you're here I have no idea

118
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,810
whatsoever in fact I don't think you

119
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,420
know why you're here either even if you

120
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,580
think you do so when I come to a

121
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,540
conference sometimes I have a

122
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,160
preconceived notion about what's gonna

123
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,860
be you know the thing that matters and

124
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,750
I'm almost never right about it you know

125
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,770
I'll look at the schedule and I'll be

126
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,090
like I'm gonna go to that talk and this

127
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,380
talk and then you know especially if

128
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,060
it's multi-track trying to figure out

129
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,350
where I'm going to spend my time and

130
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,970
what's gonna be interesting and I'm

131
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,730
almost always wrong about what turns out

132
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,640
to be important in a conference so it's

133
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,590
sort of unexpected and wonderful to

134
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,540
arrive at a conference and to see what

135
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,940
turns out to be cool what happens when a

136
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,740
group of like-minded developers actually

137
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,270
get together and see what they can

138
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,270
create together so some of your reasons

139
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,770
why you thought you might be coming here

140
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,960
maybe your boss did some people did your

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,050
bosses send you anybody

142
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,310
nobody's willing to admit it oh we have

143
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,070
one nicely done yeah so maybe your boss

144
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,450
wanted you to come and learn new skills

145
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,280
and then bring that back to the company

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,780
that's a possible idea why you thought

147
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,130
you were coming

148
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,080
or maybe you brought yourself here

149
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,490
because your boss is just a little

150
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,380
disinterested in your new skills and you

151
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,120
think that's not such a good idea that

152
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,070
could be the case as well

153
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,840
but you know I think it's a little more

154
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,790
complicated than that I actually think

155
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,930
the stuff that can turn out to be

156
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,850
important can be a simple hallway

157
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,710
conversation where you thought it wasn't

158
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,630
anything at all when you were having it

159
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,240
and then it turns out that the person

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,830
completely inspired you to do something

161
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,950
you weren't thinking about before maybe

162
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,940
you'll meet someone will help you get

163
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,830
your next job you know that's possible

164
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,060
too you might not even be thinking

165
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,290
you're looking for a job and yet it

166
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,650
happens you might also meet someone

167
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,720
today who becomes a friend and so next

168
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,890
month when you're trying to solve a

169
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,360
really hard technical problem there's

170
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,270
some bug that you just can't figure out

171
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,950
that person now you know them you've met

172
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,070
them face to face so you can say hey you

173
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,690
know I'm really screwing up here it's

174
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,800
been a day and a half that I've been

175
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,210
trying to debug this thing can you jump

176
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,590
in and take a peek at it and help me

177
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,230
figure out what's going on so those are

178
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,850
all kinds of reasons maybe it'll be one

179
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,620
of the talks you know maybe one of the

180
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,390
talks will capture your interest may

181
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,010
you've never thought about security but

182
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,380
after hearing that talk you'll go oh wow

183
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,210
I'm really curious about that and start

184
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,920
to get into it and start to delve in and

185
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,170
learn more maybe you need to be

186
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,390
reanalyzed maybe you've gotten bored at

187
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,490
work or bored in what you're doing and

188
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,070
that could happen today as well

189
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,540
the biggest thing I think is to find

190
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,000
your community and that's that's why CSS

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,530
Kampf was created and that's what I hope

192
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,480
for you here today so one thing that I'm

193
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,810
hoping for here is that of balancing the

194
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,580
time spent as a student and as a teacher

195
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,550
I noticed it in my work I was often

196
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,040
having to be the CSS expert you know

197
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,570
everybody and the company would come to

198
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,280
me and say how does this work why isn't

199
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,870
it working what's going on here and I

200
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,180
always had to have the answers and so

201
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,590
conferences give you a chance to

202
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,240
actually switch roles for a bit and

203
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,980
maybe take a little bit more of the

204
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,990
student time and learn about things or

205
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,690
maybe you're always in the student role

206
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,280
at work and coming here you can share

207
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,870
your knowledge with somebody else that

208
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,330
you mean I think it's important to kind

209
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,640
of be in both places so the word career

210
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,790
is kind of a weird word to me it rose in

211
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,470
popularity at the end of the last

212
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,560
century it has its origins in French and

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,480
Latin words that are sort of vaguely

214
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,880
related to racetracks which honestly

215
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,770
kind of make me feel like a little

216
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,650
hamster running in the wheel I think the

217
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,090
trouble with focusing on your career and

218
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,100
coming with very exact objectives to a

219
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,770
conference is that rather than following

220
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,690
up on what really brings you joy you end

221
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,220
up sort of pursuing and running after a

222
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,560
sort of abstract notion of what success

223
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,680
is and it doesn't have the authenticity

224
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,430
of pursuing your real interests so I'm

225
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,100
going to go out on a limb and say to

226
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,660
hell with your career let's just follow

227
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,550
your heart I think it's almost

228
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,620
impossible in any given moment to figure

229
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,450
out how the things that you're doing day

230
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,760
to day fit into the big picture so I

231
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,050
think it's important to just follow your

232
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,600
gut and not worry too much about that do

233
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,970
stuff that interest you stop doing stuff

234
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,070
that doesn't interest you anymore talk

235
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,020
to people you enjoy and see what the

236
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,210
relationship brings and step out of your

237
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,310
comfort zone learn something you don't

238
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,850
know much about already oh there's a

239
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,160
cartoon in the u.s. called Family Circus

240
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,200
and when the little boy goes out to play

241
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,820
in the neighborhood this is how they

242
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,490
design that basically they get little

243
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,050
picture the neighborhood and the dotted

244
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,330
line shows how he's just moving in and

245
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,890
out around the neighborhood checking out

246
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,030
different things running in the

247
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,860
playground playing in his TP doing all

248
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,890
this stuff that he's doing this sort of

249
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,600
interests me because I read a research

250
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,400
paper that said that people who

251
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,020
considered themselves the luckiest in

252
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,610
the world and sorry I always forget the

253
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,140
origins of all the research papers I

254
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,550
read I tried to find it last night with

255
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,220
Google but did not have any luck so

256
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,480
people who considered themselves the

257
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,370
luckiest were those who added the most

258
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,170
variation to their day they took a

259
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,420
different route to work or followed up

260
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,310
on unexpected tangents went to a coffee

261
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,050
shop that they weren't expecting or

262
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,390
maybe attended a conference and met

263
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,530
people that they weren't thinking that

264
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,300
they would meet um so perhaps this

265
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,370
conference can be a chance for you to

266
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,890
allow room for a happy chance meeting or

267
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:52,020
a collaboration so this is slightly

268
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,890
self-indulgent so I hope you'll you'll

269
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,360
bear with me but I want to talk to you a

270
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,630
little bit about how my career has gone

271
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,580
in order to tell you so about some of

272
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,380
those like happy chance moments that can

273
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,700
happen so I got asked to speak at a

274
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,470
career event for college students in

275
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,900
Australia and my response was are you

276
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,910
sure I don't think you have the person

277
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,280
that you think you do so these students

278
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,990
were all wanting to be web developers

279
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,310
and I was supposed to come there and

280
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,070
tell them what the path was to becoming

281
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,070
a web developer and I think as any of us

282
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,750
knows they're sort of an infinite number

283
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,580
of paths to becoming a web developer but

284
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,220
I think mine is particularly not

285
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,460
recommended in a bunch of cases so my

286
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,410
high school was terrible like really

287
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,600
really terrible it was really tiny I

288
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,830
graduated from high school not knowing

289
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,960
even vaguely when the two world wars

290
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,600
were and I was seventh in my class so it

291
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,940
wasn't like I wasn't studying we just

292
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,920
never actually studied 20th century

293
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,830
history at all we didn't do any grammar

294
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,690
except for maybe six months when I was

295
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,220
17 it was a pretty terrible school so

296
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,750
when I got to college the course

297
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,870
catalogue for me was like this I don't

298
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,730
know it was like Christmas over and over

299
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,500
and over again every every few months a

300
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,209
new course catalog would come out

301
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,920
and I would read it like oh my god what

302
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,990
am I gonna study and I took all these

303
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,850
courses that didn't you know I did

304
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,740
you're supposed to think about a major

305
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,119
and what you're what you're trying to

306
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:21,569
achieve with it but I didn't i just took

307
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:25,749
chemistry and biology and sculpture and

308
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:28,959
drawing and actually no computer science

309
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,899
at that point I took I took whatever I

310
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,569
felt like philosophy or or art or

311
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,350
anything and never really quite knew

312
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,879
what it was gonna do and at one point my

313
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,279
dad sat me down and he's like Nicole you

314
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,749
do realize that the reason people go to

315
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,519
college is to graduate and you need to

316
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,429
get a degree in something at some point

317
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:50,170
and so I went through all of the

318
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,999
different majors that my university had

319
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,100
and I did some math and I figured out

320
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,509
which one I was closest to having a

321
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:58,119
degree in and then I finished off a

322
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,339
degree in that and so I ended up being

323
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,379
an economics major of all things but

324
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,939
that just happened to be the thing that

325
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:05,980
was mathematically closest to the

326
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,779
classes that I had already taken yeah so

327
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,459
you can imagine I'm speaking to this

328
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,199
group of students in Australia and the

329
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:16,089
teachers eyes are getting bigger and

330
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:18,670
bigger and bigger and it doesn't get

331
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,970
better either so when I graduated it

332
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,559
turns out the degrees you can get I was

333
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,179
sorry the jobs you can get with an

334
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,129
undergraduate degree in economics are

335
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,589
truly terrible I wrote credit reports

336
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:31,449
for a few months before it started

337
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:33,509
stealing my soul and I had to run away

338
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:36,549
at that point I decided that I would

339
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:38,499
become a carpenter and then I would

340
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,540
build houses for a living and so I

341
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,189
called up all the places in the

342
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:44,049
newspaper advertising jobs and they were

343
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:47,740
like no no no finally one guy said come

344
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,329
in if we don't hate you after a week

345
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:53,230
maybe we won't fire you okay that's

346
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,029
awesome I was like great I'll be there

347
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:57,759
no problem and I started off on the low

348
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,649
end of the totem pole like you know my

349
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,869
job would be that giant heap of lumber

350
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:04,029
over there that's been used already take

351
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,920
the nails out of all of it and then move

352
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,290
it over there and that was like months

353
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,799
and months of my life before I got

354
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,350
gradually allowed to do more and more

355
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,470
interesting things um so how did I

356
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,749
become a web developer from carpentry

357
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:21,759
and economics you can imagine these

358
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,620
students are just like yeah

359
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,580
think I'm gonna follow that path I hurt

360
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,100
my hands doing carpentry and I was

361
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,480
really scared because at this point I

362
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,580
had three years invested in a carpentry

363
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,590
career I wasn't really thinking of it

364
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,450
that way but I did have three years

365
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,860
invested in learning and getting better

366
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,250
at this thing and my doctor said to me

367
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,750
you have to stop you're going to be

368
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,790
disabled when you're older if you don't

369
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,560
stop doing this work I mean I was

370
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,870
lifting gigantic windows and I wasn't

371
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,430
bigger than I am now it just it really

372
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,710
wasn't a super good idea I guess

373
00:13:53,710 --> 00:14:00,160
physically so I moved to France I was

374
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,080
skipping over a few steps there but it

375
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,490
seemed like a good idea at the time even

376
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,410
though I didn't speak French and I was

377
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,120
an illegal immigrant because I didn't

378
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,500
have a visa because they don't give

379
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,060
visas to laborers basically so I was in

380
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,950
France and I was super bored I'm like I

381
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,500
can't go to school I can't get a job you

382
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,570
can't do anything if you're an illegal

383
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,400
immigrant it's a super bad position to

384
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,150
be in so I started reading w3c specs to

385
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:30,910
pass the time yeah and at the time I

386
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,620
wasn't thinking like oh this is awesome

387
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,150
I'll get a job in this I was just like

388
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,850
Oh curious new thing like let me let me

389
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,200
see what this is all about

390
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,680
right and it was great like I found

391
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,780
actually the CSS spec that I had written

392
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,520
notes in the margin because I'd printed

393
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,660
that out because back then people

394
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,390
printed things out and I you know wrote

395
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,950
all kinds of notes in the margin and

396
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,630
stuff like that and it's really neat to

397
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,310
see my little brain working through like

398
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,510
how does this stuff work

399
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,060
to be fair I read XML schema first and

400
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,070
so that made me really really terrified

401
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,560
but yeah so I continued with that and

402
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,150
did bigger and bigger projects and got

403
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,850
into the performance side of things and

404
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,210
really started to enjoy it and then I

405
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,120
had gotten a job at Yahoo and I got laid

406
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,550
off and that can be a huge thing right

407
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,010
you think oh no like I got granted it

408
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,390
was in the period where Yahoo was laying

409
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,840
off pretty much everyone but it's scary

410
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,730
you're like okay what am I gonna do now

411
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,290
what's what is the next thing is this

412
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,850
thing that I thought I was invested in

413
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,710
just went away from one day to the next

414
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,950
um so I started a company because I'd

415
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,570
been doing performance and UI

416
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,030
you eye development and help internally

417
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,500
at Yahoo so I thought you know this

418
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,790
could be a thing that someone does

419
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:48,730
externally as well later on I decided to

420
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,530
become a speaker kind of accidentally as

421
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,980
well it turns out when I was a carpenter

422
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,260
I had played dance dance revelution with

423
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,260
John Alsop who does the you know this is

424
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,830
ridiculous

425
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,200
in Japan played Dance Dance Revolution

426
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,290
with John Alsop who runs web directions

427
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,940
north and south and all the web

428
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,790
directions and that was not but I mean

429
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,530
it was long before I was doing any nerdy

430
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,080
stuff at all and then years later he's

431
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,610
like want to come speak at my conference

432
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,290
and I was like yes

433
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,420
sure I have not really done that kind of

434
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,980
thing but let's you know let's

435
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,530
absolutely do it and he's the kind of

436
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,330
guy who will take a risk on a speaker

437
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,610
who's never spoken anywhere before much

438
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,070
like you know Christina and Michael will

439
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,930
do when they get a really good proposal

440
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,510
does it doesn't care wants to you know

441
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,390
go for it and see what can come of it so

442
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,670
that's how I became a speaker and then I

443
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,470
told you about the conference organizing

444
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,510
I basically wanted to meet you guys and

445
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,920
so I thought okay well I'm gonna throw a

446
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,110
really big pain in the ass party and

447
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,150
it's gonna have speakers and be really

448
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,150
fun and so sometimes the stuff that you

449
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,520
do it just it's so hard to see there are

450
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,410
these moments like I didn't think when I

451
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,030
was playing Dance Dance Revolution in

452
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,980
Japan like years before I ever thought

453
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,390
about web development but that would be

454
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,060
how I'd get my first speaking gig but it

455
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,040
was fun and so I jumped in and I did it

456
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,439
and it's often those things that you do

457
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:10,240
without knowing how they add up to some

458
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,030
big end goal that end up being really

459
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:18,880
really cool um so two months ago I had

460
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,949
another one of those moments around a

461
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:23,230
really silly romantic comedy which I'm a

462
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,570
little bit embarrassed to admit but it's

463
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,060
called he's just not that into you and

464
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,680
the premise is that there's this girl

465
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,090
who is having some trouble dating she's

466
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,710
like going out with these guys but

467
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,050
they're not calling her back or they're

468
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,910
taking two weeks to call her back and

469
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,040
she's going what am I doing wrong should

470
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,410
I call them should I say this what if I

471
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,540
said that instead and then finally one

472
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,310
of her friends just says he's just not

473
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,080
that into you he just doesn't like you

474
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,530
that much

475
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,710
there's nothing you can do about it and

476
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,420
the interesting thing was I watched it

477
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,070
and I thought oh my god that's how I

478
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,140
feel about owning my own company right

479
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,510
now I'm just not that into it I don't

480
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,310
want to call it back I don't want to go

481
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,870
out on another date I'm just sort of

482
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,400
like yeah all right

483
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,800
so I have a company and so I quit and

484
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,420
sort of quit I'm getting quitting over

485
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,330
time but the truth be told right now I

486
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,400
have no idea how that fits into the

487
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,840
bigger picture I don't know what I'm

488
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,290
gonna do next I don't know why I am

489
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,110
right here right now but I do know that

490
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,390
since I did that I've been more excited

491
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,920
and I've been having more fun than I had

492
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,160
had in ages I wrote three blog posts in

493
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,170
one day after not writing any for like

494
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,900
nine months or a year it completely

495
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,640
changed my perspective letting go of

496
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,710
this thing that I thought was my career

497
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,140
and I needed to hang on to it I'm

498
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,030
learning Ruby and JavaScript to

499
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,860
complement my CSS because I want to be

500
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,660
able to build more cooler things and not

501
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,190
have to ask somebody else to build the

502
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,550
other part of it for me so why did I do

503
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,450
this I have no idea at all except that I

504
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,100
know now that I'm moving toward the

505
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,450
thing that feels like the right thing to

506
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,250
do and I'm gonna go for it

507
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,290
and I hope that the reasons will make

508
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,120
sense long-term there's these moments

509
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,620
where I go oh dear God it's not gonna

510
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,130
make sense but I believe that all those

511
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,050
other times I followed my heart you know

512
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,180
I played Dance Dance Revolution in Japan

513
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,230
and it worked out so those critical

514
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,330
life-changing moments you rarely know

515
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,550
that they're important or critical when

516
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,980
they're actually happening so I think we

517
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,900
have to jump in and like get involved in

518
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,030
an open-source project or attend a

519
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,290
conference that we weren't going to

520
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,930
attend or participate more fully in the

521
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,090
community so that we have back up when

522
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,600
we can't figure out that nasty bug so

523
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,340
you know maybe you never have thought

524
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,260
you were interested in animation until

525
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,110
you hear Rachel stock or you know maybe

526
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,180
Chris and Alex's talks will make you

527
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,830
want to get involved in pre-processors

528
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,420
and digging into the guts of how they

529
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,840
work and making them better

530
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,890
maybe roz fun and Angelina will inspire

531
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,780
you to look to the future of

532
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,250
technologies that you live and breathe

533
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,390
every day and to

534
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,549
see around that corner at what is gonna

535
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:09,130
be next or maybe Harry will help you

536
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,500
push back on the design that you're

537
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,720
getting and get better styles from your

538
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,940
designer so that you can build something

539
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,260
that you really believe in and that

540
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,900
you're happy with so I suggest that

541
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,150
today you go out and you discover the

542
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,610
secret of why you're here the thing that

543
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,110
you couldn't have planned for in advance

544
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,620
because who knew you know you had to get
