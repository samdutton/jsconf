10
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,070
so thank you for having me comms is my

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,239
first time in Carlsbad no one no one

12
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,460
will tell me why what Carl did I I've

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,880
been really nervous all week so if you

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,380
know I'd like to find out and yeah so

15
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,760
thank you for taste and for having me

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,470
thank you to all our problematic

17
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,860
sponsors for making this event happen I

18
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,979
am going to do as I usually do which is

19
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:29,140
tell a story when when I was a kid I was

20
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,390
very good at school except for history

21
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,390
class it was my least favorite class I

22
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,880
was and still am very bad at memorizing

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,950
things that I don't see the point of

24
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,680
remembering like years famous men in

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,670
powder wigs are born and as a response

26
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,490
to my frustrations about the subject my

27
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,010
father would always tell me those who do

28
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,659
not study history are doomed to repeat

29
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:52,990
it

30
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,170
imagine I'm a very thick Brooklyn accent

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,720
and I resented it because it didn't make

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,670
the class any easier and my grades

33
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,850
improve but since then I have come to

34
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,540
realize that he or the Spanish

35
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,069
philosopher George Santayana who

36
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:12,239
actually came up with that quote I

37
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,019
realize that maybe he was onto something

38
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:16,120
there are many things that have happened

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,599
in history that are happening again a

40
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,100
lot of bad things

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,960
but also good things and we're doing a

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,940
pretty bad job at recognizing that and

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,820
adapting accordingly even in our humble

44
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,810
JavaScript community like have you

45
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,180
considered that many of our so-called

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,370
innovations in JavaScript actually have

47
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,800
prior art we didn't invent functional

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,770
programming or command-line interfaces

49
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,630
you know for JavaScript frameworks

50
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,600
that's like the new hot thing now we

51
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,700
didn't invent codes of conduct at events

52
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,650
every mall in Jersey in New York at

53
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,930
least has codes of conduct this is the

54
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,080
Atlantic terminal in Brooklyn and we

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,670
also did invent baking bread which is a

56
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,510
huge trend through here this is a really

57
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,970
great photo 19:17 of a couple of

58
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,250
backbone.js developers taking a break to

59
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,420
check on their their bread these

60
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,910
particular things have not been actively

61
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,580
harming society but I think it's slowing

62
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,670
the the industry down it's been like a

63
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,160
solid five years and a few months since

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,870
I entered this industry from academia

65
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,940
and most of the public discourse about

66
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,820
the language is still just shitposting

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,910
which doesn't seem very innovative or

68
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,030
inventive to me and I fancy myself an

69
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,850
innovator and an inventor I invented the

70
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:42,430
bike plow and it was at this event in

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,990
2014 when I innovated efficient search

72
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:51,070
with the jorts sort algorithm four years

73
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,260
later and shortswords been implemented

74
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,580
in 47 different languages which means

75
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,670
I'm not the crazy

76
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,880
it wasn't rxjs but then they moved repos

77
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,280
and I think an envious soul removed it

78
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,350
so maybe one of you can make a pull

79
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,500
request and put it back in but over the

80
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,300
past year or so my my focus has shifted

81
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,100
from jean shorts and efficient sorts to

82
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,170
ethics and technology especially its

83
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,480
relationship with art history get you a

84
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,170
woman who can do both

85
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,419
[Music]

86
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:30,050
there through my explorations of the

87
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,300
parallels between ethical quandaries and

88
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,789
the art world's past and present and the

89
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,310
tech industry's President future I've

90
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,259
learned a lot more than I anticipated

91
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:41,780
about how my decisions as a software

92
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,110
engineer and citizen impact the people

93
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,699
in the communities and I'm a part of

94
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,680
I think software engineers have a huge

95
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,780
tendency to forget that we are also

96
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,310
citizens and it turns out that we may

97
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,199
have already been doomed to repeat

98
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,590
history and our industry is actively

99
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,750
ignoring that or trying to rewrite it

100
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,690
and it's driven me to take a more

101
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,940
historical approach in my education

102
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,220
around web development so instead of

103
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,220
like just learning a cutting-edge API or

104
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,289
a long existing one that I finally now

105
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,539
have to use her project I've been

106
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:20,479
researching those technologies and I

107
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,070
found that it's become a requirement for

108
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,229
me to getting a true sense of what their

109
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,180
purpose is so I know exactly how to use

110
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,430
it a lot of people that are introduced

111
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,830
introduce two new frameworks or api's

112
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,660
they use it but they're not aware of

113
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,220
what the best practices are because they

114
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,050
don't know the history of how that

115
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,820
framework came to be and through that

116
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,370
history you kind of infer those best

117
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,830
practices but I wasn't invited here to

118
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,530
talk about how our ignoring history has

119
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,240
led us to normalize the existence of

120
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,210
Nazis in person and online or how

121
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,789
several the tech companies represented

122
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,430
here are complicit by you know actively

123
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,740
allowing hateful organizations like

124
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,750
Breitbart to sell ugly t-shirts to a

125
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,610
large subset of our nation that believes

126
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,729
that most most a few of the people in

127
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,560
this room don't deserve basic human

128
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,909
rights like actually existing or by

129
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:15,409
helping ice to organize their emails and

130
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,930
outlook I'm here to talk about the

131
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,970
tiniest unit of programmable color on a

132
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,680
computer-generated image enhance thank

133
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,360
you the pixel I'm being that this is Jas

134
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,449
cough which stands for JavaScript cough

135
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:35,210
I keep being reminded I should define

136
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,150
that pixel in JavaScript

137
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,840
x coordinate y coordinate and a color

138
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,790
but this is the amp track and so on

139
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,050
legally obligated to provide

140
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,360
high-performance JavaScript free

141
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,550
examples so because of the fact that

142
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,220
anything displayed digitally is made up

143
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,220
of pixels and that none of us in here

144
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,620
not even me can truly define what is art

145
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,380
I want us to move onward together on

146
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,570
this eight-hour filibuster so that horse

147
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,290
J s is not exposed with the assumption

148
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,180
that literally everything is pixel art

149
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,410
and slide transitions my name is Jen

150
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,690
Schiffer when I'm not shining the

151
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,630
spotlight on my ADHD with my bizarre

152
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,690
tech intros I make both pixel art and

153
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,630
digital art tooling specifically around

154
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,680
pixel art that's me

155
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,190
so pixel art or it's popularly searched

156
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,010
nickname and sometimes misnomer 8-bit

157
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,320
art is a style of art that embraces

158
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
retro graphics especially from

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,240
videogames going as far back as the 60s

160
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
it's a style that works both on the

161
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,570
screen and off my Pixar it tends to be

162
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,390
more analog written on paper and pixel

163
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,860
art is abstract you don't need to be

164
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,020
great or good even at drawing photo

165
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,130
realistic art and because it turns out

166
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,950
you only need a little bit of data in

167
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,020
this case under a thousand pixels and I

168
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,600
think like six colors but a little bit

169
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,070
of data goes a long way towards

170
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,960
conveying something as complex as human

171
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,720
emotion and that's why I make art to

172
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,670
express feelings and because art is

173
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,350
abstract enough that it provides me

174
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,930
means to define what perfection is when

175
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,270
it comes to expressing those feelings

176
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,600
and pixel art lowers the barrier to

177
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,310
artistic expression while invoking

178
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,170
nostalgia in a fun and positive way

179
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,180
which is why I love it and it's what

180
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,340
drives me to work on make 8-bit art calm

181
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,620
which is a free in browser pixel art

182
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,690
editor that thousands of people use

183
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,960
every day to express themselves in an

184
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,990
abstract and nostalgic way I'm also the

185
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,550
director of community engineering at

186
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,040
glich director sounds really fancy I

187
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,560
feel like the Greta Gerwig of JavaScript

188
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,360
and this is where I build and run most

189
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,950
of my work today and try to empower

190
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,870
other creative people to love and use

191
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,900
the web to express themselves with code

192
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,610
glitches the friendliest community of

193
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,470
coders building the apps of their dreams

194
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,690
and helping others to do this to do the

195
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,100
same glitch is similar to pixel art and

196
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,630
make a pit art in that I feel like it

197
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,370
lowers the barrier to expression while

198
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,470
invoking nostalgia and a fun and

199
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,750
positive way and then the case of glitch

200
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,850
the medium is code and the tools are the

201
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,620
community and the collaborative editor

202
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,700
in the browser I didn't see some glitch

203
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,160
users in the audience already so shouts

204
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,230
out and if you haven't tried it out

205
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,600
yourself I say give it a shot

206
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,430
we're trying to build something that you

207
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,940
know leaves people feeling joy which is

208
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,520
something that I feel we've seen to have

209
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,740
lost since the days of Geocities early

210
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,100
Neopets and the hit Warner Brothers film

211
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,170
Space Jam so I've been studying art in

212
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,210
tech in tandem and through that I've

213
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,210
become a better artist engineer and also

214
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,240
a better citizen I always say that to be

215
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,700
a good programmer you need to be using

216
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,570
code to do social good and not harm

217
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,980
which lately seems to be easier said

218
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,880
than done

219
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,220
I think that a lot of Engineers have

220
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,560
forgotten that or worse actively ignored

221
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,170
that but again I'm not here to talk

222
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,240
about how there are tech companies maybe

223
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,460
some even represented here who are paid

224
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,230
a lot of money to develop unsheathe

225
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,300
black box algorithms used to sentence

226
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,430
people to prison or tear families apart

227
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,170
there are unethical deportation

228
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,030
processes I'm here to talk about pig

229
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,990
Florida and JavaScript oh I'm sorry

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,390
so yeah

231
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,180
pixel art JavaScript yes because that's

232
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,890
what the schedule says which by the way

233
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,040
my page on the Jas comp website Derek

234
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,930
had added an Easter Egg in all the text

235
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,880
is in the lower case because that's how

236
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,120
I typically write I've always been very

237
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,310
interested in pixel art as someone who

238
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,800
creates it and as I entered the tech

239
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,990
industry as a proponent of the open web

240
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,610
and the democratization of the

241
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,149
she's around it I gained a passion for

242
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:06,070
creating tools to facilitate the

243
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,649
creation of pixel art particularly with

244
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,600
the JavaScript language so it makes

245
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,370
sense that I ended up working at glitch

246
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,930
so I can facilitate the creation of

247
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,310
JavaScript and an artistic life just

248
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,649
like me pixel art has a background in

249
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,829
academia I was a professor an

250
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:26,110
administrator and academia and then left

251
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,480
for the tech industry five years ago the

252
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,490
first time the term pixel art was

253
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,820
published was in the December 1982 issue

254
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,440
of the ACM communications journal which

255
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,750
ACM is the Association of Computing

256
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,870
Machinery are there any members in here

257
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,640
it's a long-running professional

258
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,930
organization working to advance

259
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,630
computing as a profession they also

260
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,089
author the ACM code of ethics and

261
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:54,880
professional conduct which is a must

262
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,510
read I wouldn't call the 1982 issue a

263
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,730
must read pixel art was only mentioned

264
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,790
to describe how they morphed the like

265
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,970
previous white guy president ACM into

266
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,560
the next white guy president of ACM I

267
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,000
did up on Amazon this is the least

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,890
popular book in the Animorphs series I

269
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,990
think that's why ACM pivoted to ethics

270
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,290
and professional conduct like like how

271
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,140
before the painting came the paint

272
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,329
before the pixel art there was a pixel

273
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:30,519
and someone said someone say the Picts

274
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,500
was created with the invention of

275
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,620
photography in 1839 or the first CRT

276
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,970
television right here in 1927 or color

277
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,550
television in the 1950s but they're

278
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,519
wrong those aren't actually pixels I

279
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,290
would argue that it was the

280
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,390
impressionist movement in the mid 1880s

281
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,079
where we see the first pixels

282
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,790
pointillism a technique popularized

283
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,579
popularized by Georges Seurat it's

284
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:58,930
perhaps one of the earliest forms of

285
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,779
analog pixel art if you can forgive the

286
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:04,570
irregular grid each dot does have a

287
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,480
color an x and y-coordinates on some

288
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,950
sort of canvas

289
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,720
there's a Persian by the way it would be

290
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,850
out of character for me to not plug my

291
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,149
old publication Bart Institute where I

292
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:26,060
wrote code and prose inspired by fine

293
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,440
artists so if you want to learn more

294
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,720
about Seurat and see a pic sorts been on

295
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,520
some of his work you should check it out

296
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,190
so although people are not sure exactly

297
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,270
when the word was for spoken pixel first

298
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,790
appeared in print in 1965 by the Jet

299
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,089
Propulsion Laboratory or JPL

300
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:47,990
surprisingly there was a time when we

301
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,700
were just building tech to destroy

302
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,490
democracy and human rights back then the

303
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,529
JPL was trying to enhance images from

304
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,300
outer space and conduct research on

305
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,550
computer imaging so we can have the nice

306
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,760
displays that we have today and in the

307
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,770
sixties dozens of computer scientists

308
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,480
working out of iconic research

309
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,089
institutions like JPL Xerox PARC Bell

310
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:10,610
Labs we're innovating displays and the

311
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,290
creation of imagery for those displays

312
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,910
and they were hiring artists to come and

313
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,459
create art with their software imagine

314
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,320
that allowing artists into the office

315
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,670
david m was one of those visual artists

316
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,860
he was not particularly interested in

317
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,770
innovating as a digital painter he came

318
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,600
from traditional paint but it was par

319
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,220
for the course when hardware and

320
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,200
software for making art were so young

321
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,190
and also like broken all the time in an

322
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,770
intro to his book on art cleverly titled

323
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,580
the art of David M he expressed exactly

324
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,160
how I feel about my MacBook Pro with the

325
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,800
touch bar he said I quickly learned that

326
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,150
making pictures the state of art

327
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,650
computers required a lot more than

328
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,690
simply learning user tools computer

329
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,490
programs are delicate and fragile as are

330
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,079
many of the personalities who created

331
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,209
them everything was in a state of

332
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,829
development and the machines tended to

333
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:06,079
break down speaking of display woes back

334
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,670
then the only way to capture digital

335
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,130
displays was to literally photograph the

336
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,980
screen I can relate as I recently moved

337
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,589
from using a math book to this Windows

338
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,180
machine and I still have no idea

339
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,090
how to take a screenshot on it

340
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,200
David Emmel is also one of the several

341
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,700
artists were able to use super paint

342
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,890
which is an 8-bit digital color painting

343
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,870
system created out of Xerox PARC by

344
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,790
Richard sharp and its colleagues one of

345
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,370
whom was the co-creator Pixar I'll be

346
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,950
Ray Smith if you go to his website it's

347
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,810
currently updated and I think rivals

348
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,620
space jams and this is the the rack that

349
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,440
the hardware sat on super paint was an

350
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,510
innovative image and image editing

351
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,399
application that became the foundation

352
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,370
of future imaging editing editing

353
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,260
software that we even used today and

354
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,720
this artwork black girls by this artist

355
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,700
Fritz Fischer who took a job as a night

356
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,860
guard at Xerox PARC so that he can in

357
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,800
his off time use the system to draw this

358
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,790
is one of the earliest and most

359
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,920
impressive digital paintings made on the

360
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,850
system and in 1983 super paint one Xerox

361
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,430
and Emmy so take that like whatever

362
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,990
actor ever won an Emmy well perhaps a

363
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,670
charm to most about super paint when I

364
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,410
learned about it was how its tools were

365
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,770
drawn using super paint itself this was

366
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,930
a major validation for me doing the same

367
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,390
for make 8-bit art calm this is actually

368
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,029
super paint somebody running on my

369
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:37,670
macbook you can get the executable file

370
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,320
and I used wine bottles so I could run

371
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,029
it on the Mac and it worked

372
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:46,520
look at my beautiful try so back in 2011

373
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,500
I was interested in learning JavaScript

374
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,810
and leaving academia and so I built make

375
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,709
a bit art comm as a way to learn

376
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,240
JavaScript and build something I would

377
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,190
use again I don't know how to explain

378
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,390
shot unlike super paint which sat on

379
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,390
like two five-foot equipment racks my

380
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,209
system sat on like a folder on a shared

381
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:13,400
hosting site which no an initial launch

382
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,199
it was a large difficult aenor that held

383
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,819
many smaller disk wares

384
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,160
where on click it would have its

385
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,319
background color change to one of those

386
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,380
several options of the color I gave the

387
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,780
user and to save your art I told you to

388
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,510
take a screenshot

389
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,830
maybe a horrible human what I should

390
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,710
have done was tell you to photograph it

391
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,970
to make the user experience easier

392
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,620
though I learned about the canvas API

393
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,630
realized I needed to know a little bit

394
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,300
more about JavaScript than just jquery's

395
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,950
click and CSS functions in this this

396
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,230
code and make a pitar is doesn't use

397
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,500
amps so I'm not gonna do that here you

398
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,360
have it you have a canvas you grab the

399
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,090
context depending on the X&Y of where

400
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,180
the mouse clicks you just draw a square

401
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,890
on the grid using clear rector fill

402
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,120
direct I was a PHP developer at the time

403
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,010
so the save functionality that made

404
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,960
sense to me was obviously to make an

405
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,780
AJAX call to a PHP script that created

406
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,790
the file I'm a shared hosting server of

407
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,470
the image and returned that images

408
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,740
location to the user for them to save

409
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,790
and of course I forgot to write the

410
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,350
script that made this files only

411
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,440
temporary which I realized when I got an

412
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,150
email from my shared hosting company

413
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,340
reporting that like not only was i I

414
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,650
disk space but like the entire like rack

415
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,040
was like filled with about 1,200 marques

416
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,670
and I realized this all could be

417
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,220
remedied and done client-side and so I

418
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,530
rewrote the whole thing and I even made

419
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,270
the canvas of the page the full width

420
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,480
the window and a new color palette

421
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,820
features copy/paste and I realized that

422
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,030
the obsolescence of my constraints as a

423
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,740
programmer now writing client-side

424
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,050
JavaScript I was through that able to

425
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,700
remove the constraints of the artists

426
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,580
using my tools including myself and if

427
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,750
you're interested in learning about how

428
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,450
I build the app with non developers in

429
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,520
mind you should watch my notorious

430
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,320
thunder planes yes talk your grandpa

431
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,360
probably doesn't have node

432
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,070
people just call it my open-source as a

433
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,250
prison talk as I mentioned earlier

434
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,810
thousands of people use make a pit art

435
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,530
calm to draw probably most Mario's other

436
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,450
than the fact that the site loads fast

437
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,550
as hell using jQuery and web fonts

438
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,640
thanks to a lot of contributors there

439
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,770
was nothing particularly innovative

440
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,230
about what's going on on the site and

441
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,150
remember I am an innovator and an

442
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,980
inventor so naturally I was driven to

443
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,580
explore an experiment

444
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,340
I got the chance to do that in 2015 do

445
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,820
you hear my fidgets thinner so intensity

446
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,980
knows offered an unpaid artist residency

447
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,320
at the Maidan NY Media Center live in

448
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,590
the life they wanted cool technologists

449
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,269
to show the entertainment industry that

450
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:00,890
innovative things really at a median

451
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,529
image Canon to happen to your city stop

452
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:06,080
move in Hollywood where are you going

453
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,059
and I wanted to explore how to

454
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,640
conceptualize map it Florida's more of a

455
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,649
process and path from blank canvas to

456
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:13,909
something that invokes some sort of

457
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:16,669
emotion without needing to record video

458
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:18,409
or take constant photographs in my

459
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:20,600
scream and I wanted to map that

460
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,909
importance of process to the work of the

461
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:25,100
everyday developer as it seems to be

462
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,750
what artists need to do to legitimize

463
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,549
their work in the tech industry still

464
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,220
these days at least until JPL starts

465
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,279
hiring more artists so here is familiar

466
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:39,049
with the joy of painting for those

467
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:41,510
you're not it features the artist Bob

468
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,210
Ross who paints mostly landscapes in an

469
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,070
instructional format aired during the

470
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,799
80s and 90s and I don't know about you

471
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,149
all who have watched it but I never

472
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,950
watched it solely to see the end product

473
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,590
I wanted to see Ross's process see how

474
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,330
he painted those fresh mountains and

475
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,730
happy trees after all the show was

476
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,350
called the joy of painting not the joy

477
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,590
of a painting and the importance of

478
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,240
documenting process is not only

479
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,039
important in art I mean who among us in

480
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,870
this room has not cried for joy or

481
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,399
terror or sadness over version control

482
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:14,659
keeping a history of our applications

483
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:16,399
code is one of the first things we set

484
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:17,990
up before we even print out hello world

485
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,210
these days and being able to see a

486
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,549
history of what code is not only it's

487
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,149
not only useful for reverting to before

488
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:27,830
freaking commits but it's crucial for

489
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,380
auditing onboarding or simply reading

490
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,059
the history and understanding why the

491
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,250
features that exist exist and why they

492
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,789
were written the way that they were

493
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:39,799
those who do not study history of a code

494
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,389
base are doomed to repeat the same

495
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:43,250
mistakes its developers made and past

496
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:48,169
sprints I said

497
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,860
to me the joy codon is seeing how the

498
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,929
developer got there like being able to

499
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:56,200
view source in history so it's not a

500
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,659
surprise to anyone who knows my work or

501
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:02,500
knows glitch able to view the source of

502
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,000
apps and it's why we brought that

503
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,960
functionality to server side files and

504
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,640
also we ever get realigned interface so

505
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,049
you can visually slide through the get

506
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:14,650
history of your app studying history if

507
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,659
we have to do it or else be doomed we

508
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:18,789
shouldn't feel doomed and cry while

509
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:20,770
we're studying it like I did in my AP

510
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,820
government in politics class I did not

511
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:30,039
by the way so there's been a lot of

512
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,809
really weird interesting debate over

513
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,059
whether to keep you source or get rid of

514
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:34,480
it

515
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,669
as if that's even a real idea it's

516
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:39,580
already kind of hidden from view and I

517
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,029
say it's important for new developers to

518
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,820
be able to learn to build the web like

519
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,940
we did by seeing working code and not

520
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,309
learning alone others say that if you

521
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:52,990
fight for view source and that means

522
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,970
that you hate performing code you don't

523
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,409
care about the people who have bad

524
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:59,049
internet access which isn't true and I

525
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,610
think it's a completely unfair argument

526
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,830
my stance on it is that it's it's 2018

527
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,230
we have we have a robot on Mars that

528
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,090
apparently sings happy birthday to

529
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,330
itself we have a Tesla orbiting

530
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,049
in space and you can get like a 20%

531
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:19,090
discount at Helens pizza in Jersey City

532
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,630
if you pay with Bitcoin so technology is

533
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,610
like advances and it's still

534
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,210
evolving so instead of both sides

535
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,200
dismissing the other's movement we

536
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,460
should instead figure out a way to

537
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,250
provide a performin information

538
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,000
superhighway surfing experience without

539
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,289
obfuscating our coach the point that

540
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:40,330
there's no transparency as to what our

541
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,090
apps are even doing and this can mean

542
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,220
that we innovate how we bundle our code

543
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,679
or how we host it or how browsers render

544
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,250
it or even what languages we build the

545
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,960
web in which we know is changing with

546
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,240
web assembly I think that's gonna be

547
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,950
really important with the current trend

548
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,820
of developers building trackers

549
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,340
and using people's CPUs to buy and crip

550
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,990
to mine cryptocurrency

551
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,750
and consumers are becoming more hip to

552
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,640
the shitty things that are being done to

553
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,860
them through the web and I think that if

554
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,700
we want the open web to win which we do

555
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,320
we need to throw out those straw man

556
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,000
arguments and just accept the fact that

557
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,680
we have a lot of collaborative work to

558
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,620
do to promote education accessibility

559
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,770
and performance not either/or and I

560
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,980
think all of us in this room and Beyond

561
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:36,590
actually do want that

562
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,040
but I'm not here to talk about Helens

563
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,800
pizza located at 183 New York Avenue in

564
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,740
Jersey City which if you go to my meetup

565
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,600
jersey script on the last Tuesday of

566
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,360
every month you can go down the street

567
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,190
and have a slice that's really a good

568
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,290
I'm here to talk about everyone's

569
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,070
favorite no no no no I'm here to talk

570
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,790
about process so in 2005 I found this

571
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,440
flash-based drawing app called otis

572
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,150
sketch created by adobe by a design

573
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,370
agency called oda pot you may know them

574
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,750
as the premier digital partner of

575
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,510
hennessey since 2012

576
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,460
oh no sketch was really adorable to

577
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,020
provide you with small newsprint like

578
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,000
canvas to create pastel like drawings

579
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,710
and the aesthetic was really cute my

580
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,360
favorite part was that it let you replay

581
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,870
the drawing of your anyone else's art so

582
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,250
in essence it was intentionally and

583
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,870
beautifully exposing the process of the

584
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,360
art created sadly it was a prime example

585
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,250
what I've been mentioning in previous

586
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,080
talks in line non-consensual

587
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,750
ephemerality as the app and its

588
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,730
associated gallery no longer exists

589
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,030
r.i.p flash this is what happens when

590
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,410
you allow your process and final

591
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,240
creation to be locked behind proprietary

592
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,580
services and protocols which by the way

593
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,990
glitch does not lock you into

594
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,270
proprietary languages or protocols you

595
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,590
can export your apps and run them

596
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,270
anywhere there is no to engineer scoff

597
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,670
exclusive I figured an auto sketch like

598
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,380
feature that replays the process of

599
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,820
drawing Pixar would be really rad for

600
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,440
people who draw I make a pit art to come

601
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,050
and it wouldn't be too hard as I'm was

602
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,730
already saving info about each stroke

603
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,020
and paint for the reduce

604
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,120
action allottee so basically whenever

605
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,640
you drew something I would save what the

606
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,070
X&Y coordinate and the color was and add

607
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,200
that to an array so you had an array of

608
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,590
the entire history but the site is

609
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,240
making a pin art and not make 8-bit art

610
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,560
and replay it and it would be out of

611
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,600
character for me to build a monolith

612
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,310
suite of drawing and replaying tools

613
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,590
instead of having a separate app that

614
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,420
replayed the process info from my

615
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,940
drawing app and I decided that if I do

616
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,280
that I can then standardize that process

617
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,740
info in a way that it can be used in any

618
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,780
app that wanted in on the action whether

619
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,310
or not actually built it I want to

620
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:48,220
democratize the pixel and the process

621
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,160
this exploration of process in its place

622
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,350
in the open web ecosystem led to my

623
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,750
invention of picks on or Pixlr option

624
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,890
pixel art object notation and it doesn't

625
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,930
have to just be about pixel art it could

626
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,460
just be anything with pixels much like

627
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,490
how JSON is used outside of JavaScript

628
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,650
despite its name I might not write that

629
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,540
to her anymore but I always take a

630
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,980
chance to troll the daddy of JSON so

631
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,600
picks on is a proposed standard for the

632
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,850
representation the pics are using JSON

633
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,510
and properties of the exit rdf schema it

634
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,550
provides means for both lightweight data

635
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,620
interchange and the object oriented

636
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,950
creation of digital images especially

637
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,380
for pixel art I use JSON because of how

638
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,260
universal it is unlike past attempts at

639
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,080
anti compression formats like X bitmap

640
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,840
which were written in C and its sequel X

641
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,200
pixmap although this is like in the late

642
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,360
80s when the universe wasn't all that

643
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,310
big so Universal interchange was a

644
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,070
different kind of beast actually a

645
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,500
thought just crossed my mind that maybe

646
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,030
this will make a comeback with

647
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,720
webassembly

648
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,990
you know I love this format by

649
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,150
the way and it sort of inspired my

650
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,220
thinking of Brown representing animated

651
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,500
pixel art using pics on where you're

652
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,360
defining the colors as a variable and

653
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,690
then each like string is just like the

654
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,190
listing of the pixels by that color

655
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,070
which i think is pretty rad but ya pick

656
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,340
songs just JSON there are two objects

657
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,710
Exmouth and Pyxis

658
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,080
EXIF is any sort of properties defined

659
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,419
by the exchangeable image format rdf

660
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:27,970
schema which specifies the formats used

661
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,649
by digital devices like cameras and

662
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:31,539
scanners to tag digital images if you

663
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,640
look at the info of your photo it has

664
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,200
the info of like what you took the photo

665
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,630
with and you know when you think about

666
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,730
the app and software combo that you make

667
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,250
to draw pixel art is itself a digital

668
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,740
device and for the sake of Korean fits

669
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,149
art many of the properties are not

670
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:48,130
necessary or even affable applicable

671
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,590
I've narrowed it down to software

672
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,990
artists image description user comment

673
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,510
copyright in daytime but you can like

674
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,240
add as many things as you want I know it

675
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,070
J's copy you Ryan doll like one of his

676
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,330
regrets about node was how much

677
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,669
configuration is in package JSON I just

678
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:06,100
say like figure every thing and

679
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,250
package shape you can add as much as you

680
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,770
want to pics on but because it's based

681
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,120
on a schema that's existed since like

682
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,450
2003 before that pics if is the Pixar

683
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,299
it's been @exif in essence it's unique

684
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,340
to pixel images breaks down the image

685
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,590
beyond its typical metadata and focuses

686
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,570
on the individual strokes and drawings

687
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,490
of the pixels within the image

688
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,820
the first property pixels is an array of

689
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,919
pixel objects representing the pixels

690
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,960
drawn in the image so you basically push

691
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,679
to that array as the pixel is created

692
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,809
and you see those recognized with X Y

693
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:47,380
color coordinates it can or cannot be

694
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,980
immutable

695
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,659
I prefer immutable so that you're

696
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:51,039
constantly just pushing pixels so you

697
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,200
can see the whole process of drying you

698
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,240
know if you're a spy you can like write

699
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,190
a message and then erase it all and then

700
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:02,730
draw over it I love like spies seem cool

701
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,429
because it's a new idea in this format

702
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,110
the list of properties is fluid and

703
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,630
ever-changing at the moment so right now

704
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,549
it's just XY in color but it's a pretty

705
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:14,020
young standard considering how little

706
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,419
work I've been able to put into it since

707
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,549
I started I can see future Canon

708
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:21,309
properties and pics it like frames for

709
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:23,649
animated pixel art and it'll probably

710
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:26,590
look something quite like X bitmap

711
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,580
electric boogaloo and pixel objects can

712
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,010
also contain stroke IDs like they do and

713
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,900
make a bit

714
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,820
if you view the source I think Potch had

715
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,880
contributed that years ago I just

716
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,740
figured that as the community of people

717
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,540
developing what picks on grows and more

718
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,720
properties can be standardized and the

719
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,430
whole purpose of proposed in the

720
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,990
standard is so that everyone can use it

721
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,820
and build great apps on their own to

722
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,910
collaboratively and and build a

723
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,559
community of cool folks excited about

724
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,410
the open web and how it can be used to

725
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,809
continue innovating digital art I'm

726
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,400
lucky for me that's already been

727
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,780
happening in the past few years so I

728
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,210
wanted to give you a look at some of the

729
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,280
things that I've built and other people

730
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,900
have built in the past couple years that

731
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,750
import and export pick song so pick song

732
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,300
loop clip me is the original picks on

733
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,250
playground I built during my residency I

734
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,620
made in NY used to live in August dot

735
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,030
today and it's you drew it it has an

736
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,860
initial picks on file that draws that

737
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,170
message and you can export it you can

738
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,000
import picks on and play around with it

739
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,010
and it just loops drawing it over and

740
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,830
over again just want to show off that

741
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,410
glish apps have a console you can see

742
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,990
here that a the picks on file for that

743
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:45,179
drawing is only 14 kilobits and a PNG

744
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,670
file would probably be about like 50k

745
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,010
and a gif of high quality because you

746
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,140
want anti compression because pixel art

747
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,570
when it's compressed looks like garbage

748
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,210
the littlest if any compression would be

749
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,450
much higher so if you have a photograph

750
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,720
and you export it to pics on it's going

751
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,910
to be a really large JSON file you

752
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,200
probably just want to use the photograph

753
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,510
but if you're concerned about keeping

754
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,820
the process of creating abstract pixel

755
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,020
art pics on is much more performant make

756
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,840
8-bit art implements the ability to

757
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,970
import and export pics on it's not as

758
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,800
good as I'd liked it to be but I'm

759
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,390
planning to spend my open-source time in

760
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,170
q4 that's director speak for the fourth

761
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,780
quarter of the year to focus on tree

762
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,940
factory make a pit art so it doesn't use

763
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,370
jQuery I want to be more responsive so

764
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,870
it works as a PWA I got to add like a

765
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,220
manifest and all that fun stuff

766
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,020
and I want to enhance the pics on

767
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,610
experience cross-browser since there

768
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,400
tends to be issues image two picks on

769
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,399
glyph me converts her image to pics on I

770
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,460
made it on the fly because there's this

771
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,259
kid who is making a video game for his

772
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:55,859
final project in college and he had it

773
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:58,499
saved but then like his browser crashed

774
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:00,749
and localstorage for some reason cleared

775
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:03,599
out i implemented or just save your

776
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,879
artwork and he was like I need to import

777
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:07,679
this image so bad and I don't have that

778
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,749
part of me beep at art so I gave him

779
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:14,070
this evening for him to import the pics

780
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,080
on version of art and he did really want

781
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,139
less final which is really cool so even

782
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:20,580
though that's not really what the point

783
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,249
it picks on is like it's there you can

784
00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:24,809
do it people do weird stuff with all

785
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:27,479
tech that we do anyway terror against

786
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:29,460
Allah made pixel eyes which is inspired

787
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,969
by the previous app and it lets you pick

788
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,210
flies or pixel ties the image before

789
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,639
converting to pics on which i think is

790
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:40,529
pretty rad

791
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:43,049
Blake Winton made an acorn extension if

792
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:44,849
maybe use the acorn image editing app

793
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:47,369
that lets you export your images to pics

794
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:50,669
on just search acorn pics on and you'll

795
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:53,879
find the gist come up Matthew Hudson

796
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:56,879
made an NPM module I haven't had a

797
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:58,469
chance to use yet it's fairly new he

798
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,149
emailed me he said pick songs available

799
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:02,700
can I like name my module that I was

800
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,499
like I'm not your mom you can name it

801
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:06,089
that but I don't think it's like the

802
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:07,739
right name for it but he Lee did it

803
00:34:07,739 --> 00:34:13,740
anyway take me to church and then this

804
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,409
guy Annie made an SVG picks on renderer

805
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,629
which is really rad so it just takes

806
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:22,440
picks on and then converts it to SVG so

807
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,929
there are people who have made art make

808
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,849
8-bit art and they're like I want to

809
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:29,220
convert this to SVG and I'm like export

810
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,139
the pics on run it through this renderer

811
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,359
and you've got your SVG so I don't have

812
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,000
to build that monolith image editing app

813
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,859
I can have the set of like apps that I

814
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:41,490
list in the app for people to use and I

815
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,409
think you can just search SVG picks on

816
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,510
renderer on code pen and have it going

817
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,990
there and basically it just creates the

818
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:52,409
SVG element and just adds a little

819
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:55,770
pixels to it so yeah the future of pixel

820
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,720
is unknown it needs work I plan to

821
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,170
improve its usage

822
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,660
art and build more apps on glitch that

823
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,849
you all can remix and create the apps of

824
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:05,559
your dreams with and if you're

825
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,119
interested in getting involved the spec

826
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,210
can be read at Gen money dot biz slash

827
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,059
pics on of course I should probably get

828
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:15,549
its own official site who knows if you

829
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:17,170
want us to watch more of me talking

830
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,760
about pics on pixel art of computer

831
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,680
graphics in general I mean such a

832
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,630
prototype of pixel art process for

833
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,039
animation in my thgs

834
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,220
talk about the array prototype before I

835
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:33,230
had my residency it had rave reviews

836
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,099
much like he also loved my jorts art

837
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,920
talk I also then spoke at James comp

838
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,539
Columbia after my residency where I

839
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,339
launched pics on shortly after I

840
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:44,109
released the first draft yeah shout outs

841
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:47,289
in Columbia dev that's one of the best

842
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:49,299
conferences ever and I sort of

843
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:51,130
deconstructed the pixel and talked about

844
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,930
the things that I was working on back

845
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,640
then I was the only one that had been

846
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,619
doing anything that picks on and as you

847
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:58,569
can see in the past couple of years more

848
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:00,220
people have the communities growing

849
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,369
which is great I talked about some

850
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,529
computer graphics theory on specifically

851
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:07,390
how to use bresenhem's line algorithms

852
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,880
to draw lines and pixel grids at code

853
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,259
genius and some year yeah that that

854
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:18,369
crowd they think I look like Golding but

855
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:20,140
yeah that was that was a fun that's one

856
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,730
of my favorite talks

857
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,269
despite the comments so yeah yeah in

858
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:27,789
2014 I authored an algorithm ingest and

859
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,769
shortly after I authored the original

860
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:32,589
spec for picks on not not ingests this

861
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:35,230
isn't a joke and I think that anyone can

862
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,089
and should do that kind of stuff and the

863
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:38,619
great thing about tech is that much of

864
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:40,269
its history has been documented and we

865
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:42,579
could take that and run with it and then

866
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:44,079
our own technologies and help people

867
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,630
make great things and just like how

868
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,980
there's always a new framework in our

869
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,660
ecosystem that makes development easier

870
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,670
for us the evolution of all technology

871
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,829
needs us to have room to explore an

872
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:56,890
invent you know like remember how like

873
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,779
those prestigious research institutions

874
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:01,359
like JPL and Xerox PARC and Bell Labs

875
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,309
they needed help from artists and

876
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:05,230
computer scientists who had a passion

877
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,960
for art and they needed them to drive

878
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,670
innovation so we can see pixels on a

879
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,530
screen today and I feel

880
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,660
like I could already feel see it

881
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,950
happening already that history is

882
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,810
repeating itself and we're gonna need

883
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,240
artists and web developers and computer

884
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,190
scientists interested in art to drive

885
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,990
how future pixels are shown and I think

886
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,720
it's imperative that more women need to

887
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,730
be given a space and credit for that

888
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,670
exploration so I dedicate this talk to

889
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,670
Joe Miller who in 1969 in Bell Labs

890
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,880
pioneered paint software by creating the

891
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,720
first frame buffer that was three bit

892
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,820
you can't really find much info on Joan

893
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,680
and when they talk about the frame

894
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,970
buffer they're like yeah it's the first

895
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,420
but it was pretty slow it was 1969 like

896
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,390
everything was slow so yeah not

897
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,980
surprisingly homegirl doesn't have a

898
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,780
Wikipedia page and hopefully that will

899
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,040
change anyway I hope you all enjoy the

900
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,470
rest of this incredible conference I

901
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,680
think I earned this if you have

902
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,740
questions about pics on or glitch please

903
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,790
do email me or come up to me throughout

904
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,800
the day I really want to talk to y'all

905
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,150
and see what kind of cool stuff that

906
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,190
you're making and yeah thank you very

907
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,930
much
