00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,799

hi so I'm changing live audio with the

2
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:14,080
Web Audio API yes I'm going to talk

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,150
about today but first let me quickly

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,640
introduce myself I'm some belem I'm a

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,349
front-end engineer it's made with love

6
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:22,210
you can find me on the Internet as some

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,020
me so I'm a guitar player I play guitar

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,300
in my bedroom in my living room just at

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,980
home and I have this collection of of

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,160
pedals to put effects on my guitar and I

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,079
got interested in how to display these

12
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,059
pedals work how did these effects come

13
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,879
to life so I started researching making

14
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,239
the pedals myself with electronic

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,100
circuitry and stuff and then I got the

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,720
idea like a we have the Web Audio API

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,970
maybe I can create this with just using

18
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,430
javascript so that's what I try to do

19
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,920
and that's what today I will just try to

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,590
explain how I did it and you'll get a

21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,480
live demo yeah first the first thing we

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,739
need to do is get the sound of the

23
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,899
guitar in the browser so you can hear it

24
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,579
through the speaker and you can

25
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,579
manipulate the sound of the guitar with

26
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:12,549
the Web Audio API it's actually kind of

27
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:14,409
simple first you create a new audio

28
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,869
context which is the basics of the Web

29
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:21,100
Audio API then you get the audio input

30
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,649
of your computer so I just put the

31
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:26,229
guitar as a microphone basically I

32
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:28,299
connected it to my computer use

33
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,759
navigated up guess it getusermedia and I

34
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,929
can access the microphone this has been

35
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,459
deprecated like this and it's been

36
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,619
changed to navigator dot media devices

37
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:41,259
don't get user media but it only works

38
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,929
in Firefox and in chrome behind an

39
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,819
experimental web platforms feature flag

40
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:49,990
so for now I use the old version because

41
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,009
it's better supported and then basically

42
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,810
we're almost done getting the sound of

43
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,029
the guitar into the browser all you have

44
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:00,729
to do is create an input nodes from the

45
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,229
media stream we just cut from the

46
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,389
microphone off or from the guitar and

47
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:06,849
connected to the audio context

48
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:09,270
destination which is just the speaker's

49
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,239
that's step one I will demo this later

50
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,470
but basically that's all you have to do

51
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,860
to just get the sound of your guitar in

52
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,069
your browser and

53
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,090
you play guitar on the app step to add

54
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,189
effects to the guitar sound because

55
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:27,319
that's what I wanted to do I just wanted

56
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,200
to alter the sound you use some effects

57
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,040
and make some cool noise basically then

58
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,739
you have a few of different pedals which

59
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,709
you can find on most pedal boards the

60
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,840
most basic one is a volume pedal in

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,239
which with which you just can change the

62
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,439
volume of your guitar this is quite easy

63
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,329
because in the Web Audio API you have

64
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:51,620
something as the gain note which

65
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,349
controls the game or just the volume you

66
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:56,689
can create one which is odd with just

67
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:58,459
doing all your context or create game

68
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:01,819
and then set the game which is usually

69
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,189
between zero and one or zero percent and

70
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:07,159
1 percent then you connect the input

71
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,810
node to the gain nodes we gain out to

72
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,000
the audio context destination and you

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,489
have a chain of input gain and output

74
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,310
and the gain in the middle will control

75
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,909
the volume of your signal signal I have

76
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,079
a quick demo of how the gano it effects

77
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,629
your audio waves this is just an audio

78
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,349
wave of a fixed node but again out of

79
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,519
100% so the volume is 100% if you change

80
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,319
it to 50 you will see that the waves are

81
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,870
getting thinner if you put it bigger you

82
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,909
will see the way is get bigger but they

83
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,500
get clipped on the top of the top and

84
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,079
the bottom that's basically how the gain

85
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,840
no it works it just decreases or

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,650
increases the gain of your signal this

87
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,419
is the audio chain I talked about if you

88
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:55,819
just want to put a volume pedal on your

89
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,609
guitar sound or on any input sounds this

90
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:00,199
is what you have to do inputs do not

91
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,909
gain out outputs

92
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,479
done then the second one when you play

93
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,900
guitar unless you play country music or

94
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,540
so you want to have this little bit

95
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,870
gnarly sounding guitar or metal rock

96
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,909
whatever doesn't matter you want it to

97
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:19,639
be rough this is usually a distortion

98
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,530
pedal or a first pedal or an overdrive

99
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,360
pedal does it really matter it's all

100
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,780
something that affects the waves of the

101
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,510
sound waves in a way that it sounds

102
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,650
rough

103
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,440
dirty doesn't matter

104
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,720
we can do this with a wave shaper note a

105
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,790
wave shaper note is basically just a

106
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,670
note that you can create and you can

107
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,760
give it a mouth curve and it will apply

108
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,420
this curve to your audio signal it's

109
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,360
very complicated to calculate these

110
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,860
curves so there's one very good one on

111
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,910
stackoverflow there's a link in my

112
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,070
presentation if you want to see it it's

113
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,500
just a lot of math stuff which I don't

114
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,300
really understand but it works I can do

115
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,760
I can show you what it does because we

116
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,770
have the basic inputs I'm single again

117
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,060
it's just the sine wave if you apply the

118
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,830
formula or the curves to this sine wave

119
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,810
you will see that it's suddenly becomes

120
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,340
a totally different way if it's get

121
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,140
chopped off at the bottom and at the top

122
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,510
and this is what makes your sound

123
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,320
actually rough dirty proof you'll hear

124
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,540
this later as well one of if you want to

125
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,520
make it a single path it's just again

126
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,070
input wave shape or node output it's

127
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,450
always this simple you have the input

128
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,860
node you have the output which are the

129
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,020
speakers and in between you can just put

130
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,830
as many audio nodes as you want in this

131
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,050
case the volume and the distortion are

132
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,380
quite simple the next few examples will

133
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,020
be a bit more nodes in between but the

134
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,690
basic stay the same inputs audio notes

135
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,170
other audio nodes outputs then a third

136
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,330
pedal which you can commonly find on

137
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,790
guitar players or keyboard players or

138
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,370
whatever is a delay pedal a delay effect

139
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,050
is basically something that takes your

140
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,150
sound and repeats a few times while

141
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,940
failing out so you have this delayed

142
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,540
sounds after you play it to make this

143
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,610
there's a delay nodes in the Web Audio

144
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,630
API it's the same we do audio context or

145
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,700
create delay you can say the delay value

146
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,210
in this case it's one second you connect

147
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,090
it from input to delay node to the

148
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,690
output you have a delay but in essence

149
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,240
until I know it just delays the sound

150
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,940
and it doesn't really repeat it so if

151
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,320
you want to really make the delay effect

152
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,550
of the you want to rig ATAR it's a bit

153
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:45,820
more

154
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,850
complicated it looks like this we

155
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,620
basically just send the delay it sounds

156
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,570
too gay no it's decrease its value send

157
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,280
it back to delay back and forth until

158
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,560
the gain or the gain is zero so the

159
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,290
volume is zero so it will stop repeating

160
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,310
that way it fades out the next one is a

161
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,880
flanger pedal anger is a bit like a

162
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,110
delay but it has a dynamic time or

163
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,630
duration or speed of the delay so it's

164
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,460
not going to repeat like pom pom pom but

165
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,890
it's going to be like a sine wave going

166
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,100
up and down fast and slow and to create

167
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,840
a sine wave if we can use an oscillator

168
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,450
note oscillator notes are basically just

169
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,600
audio notes which create a sine wave or

170
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,710
a square wave just one big stone you can

171
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,930
use to make a synthesizer for example it

172
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,720
has a few values you can edit the most

173
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,000
important ones are type which is a sine

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,820
wave for a more a nice sine wave or a

175
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,550
square wave or a sawtooth wave or a

176
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,800
triangle wave and you can set the

177
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
frequency which is basically the tone of

178
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,520
your of your sounds if it's a height if

179
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,020
it's a high frequency it will be a very

180
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,090
high tone with a low frequency it will

181
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,180
be a very low tone you can put any

182
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,820
number you want but humans usually can

183
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,520
just hear that the frequency is between

184
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,920
20 and 20 thousands but if you want to

185
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,200
annoy your dog just put it on five you

186
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,940
will hear it you will not you will not

187
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,360
be happy I will here you can see and

188
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,100
also they don't know it by default it's

189
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,890
a sine wave which is just a sine wave if

190
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,440
you make it a square wave it's something

191
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,770
else

192
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,090
triangle wave sawtooth that's all

193
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,219
something else and then you can control

194
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:38,530
the Hertz which you will see it goes

195
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,080
faster and faster the higher the the

196
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,020
Hertz go and I can annoy you and let you

197
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,250
listen to the sound which is kinda

198
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,950
annoying but that's what is what an

199
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,320
oscillator does it just creates one one

200
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,650
sounds that just continues to be

201
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,899
annoying

202
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:01,490
one of the cool things though is that an

203
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,459
oscillator note it creates a wave so if

204
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:07,130
you want to create a dynamic delay like

205
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,410
in a flanger you can just create the

206
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,990
wave of the oscillator to the delay time

207
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,300
the delay note we saw earlier which you

208
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,279
can set the time so it will just go up

209
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,440
and down constantly depending on the

210
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,720
speed of your oscillator so the delay

211
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,769
will be dynamic a.k.a flanger basic

212
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,800
flanger then the last pedal I want to

213
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,430
talk about is a reverb pedal a reverb

214
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,820
effect is usually a bit of eco

215
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,680
atmosphere behind the sound of your

216
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,370
guitar or your keyboard or whatever

217
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,519
instrument you want to play and we can

218
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,540
do this with using a convo over note

219
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,100
it's a bit more difficult because you

220
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,529
have to load an impulse response file

221
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,260
then get an array buffer out of it and

222
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,839
then decode the audio data and put it as

223
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,600
a buffer of the controller nodes and

224
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,920
basically what this will do is an

225
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,440
impulse impulse response file is just a

226
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,110
file with characteristics like is a big

227
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,149
room it has some echo that

228
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,370
characteristics are in that file and the

229
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,959
convolve inaudible projects these

230
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,209
characteristics on the sounds you're

231
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:18,260
making so on my guitar I didn't make

232
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,450
this impulse response file myself but

233
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,550
I'm Chris Wilson has the Webber the

234
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,920
playground which has a very few very

235
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,410
good example or a few good examples

236
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,740
actually and then if you want to make

237
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,140
the effect it's also just a few notes

238
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,209
together with the convo over notes and

239
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:38,570
you get the the effect you want the

240
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,100
river actually so there are a lot a lot

241
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,600
of other notes I'm not going to talk

242
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,550
about all of them you have and as

243
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,890
analyzer note which just analyzes your

244
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,190
auto audio and you can get data like

245
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,560
frequency or stuff like in the first

246
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,089
slide I add the wave which you could see

247
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,730
it was just an analyzer node analyzing

248
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,190
my microphone if a big quad filter note

249
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,959
which is just to filter some frequencies

250
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,510
channels better and merger shell split

251
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,630
channels from stereo to mono or the

252
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,970
other way around I don't know to go from

253
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,340
left

254
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,760
right or if you have a seven points one

255
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,560
Dolby Surround system or something to

256
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,500
just position the audio inside a space

257
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,530
which can be 3d and you can use a

258
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,390
paranoid for that or a dynamics

259
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,370
compressor not-it's just to compress

260
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,520
audio and I'll go do it go into details

261
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,080
of these because they're cool but

262
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,420
they're not necessary for my

263
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,250
demonstration then it's cool that you

264
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,720
can create all these things but as

265
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,460
you've seen some of these effects are a

266
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,470
little bit complicated you have the

267
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,850
schemes and if all the notes working

268
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,420
together so I started building a library

269
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,360
where you can just create easy audio

270
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,360
effects it's kind of working

271
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,910
I used it there's still a lot for it to

272
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,560
do if somebody's interested you can

273
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,800
still help me or give feedback whatever

274
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,870
you want but basically it works like

275
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,300
this you want to have an input you want

276
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,310
the distortion or delay effect import it

277
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,230
create a new distortion or delay effect

278
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,330
and chain it all together that's all you

279
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,540
have to do so I'm quite happy with the

280
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,930
results already and now let's see if it

281
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:37,070
works

282
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,149
I'm not really good and playing guitar

283
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,750
in front of people but we'll see I've

284
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,040
made this small application on top of

285
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,500
this library I was I am building which

286
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,410
is just an interface to create the

287
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,890
effect notes first off you start by

288
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,399
creating an input node and let me see if

289
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,270
it's going to use my guitar yep if you

290
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,760
this is just now going from the input my

291
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,910
microphone to the output the speakers

292
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,709
which will just let you listen to the

293
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:13,800
guitar it's nothing effect yeah there's

294
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,860
no effect yet it's just input output

295
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,230
guitar but then you can start adding

296
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,550
effects like volume pedal which is now

297
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,810
the full volume but you can put

298
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,670
unless to create just control the volume

299
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:37,940
next up we have distortion it will just

300
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:47,089
make your guitar sound super badass the

301
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,730
next one is the delay effects I'm going

302
00:13:49,730 --> 00:14:07,650
to put it a little bit faster so you can

303
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,460
just keep some going and fades out

304
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,080
eventually you can still control the

305
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,850
parameters but that's something you can

306
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,220
play with for hours and hours so I'm not

307
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,500
going to do this next up is the flanger

308
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,650
let me switch off the delay turn these

309
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,560
on because it's badass and then this is

310
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,110
the dynamic delay which goes faster and

311
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:33,500
slower waving sound in the audio that's

312
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,080
the flanger and then last the reverb

313
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:50,880
effect in the background

314
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,200
so we had this is basically just using

315
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,480
javascript to control the sound of my

316
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:03,850
guitar pretty cool Danny we're not

317
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,130
finished yet what if you have our hands

318
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,540
of not view if you don't have our hands

319
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,250
available to control the mouse because I

320
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,290
have my left hand on the guitar my right

321
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,180
hand on the pig but I want to switch

322
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,310
between effects and stuff there's

323
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,320
something called about MIDI API which

324
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,260
we've seen yesterday night it was very

325
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,470
cool so I've tried to integrate it with

326
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,870
this little app I have so I can just use

327
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,720
my feet to control the switching on and

328
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,200
off of the effects what I did is I built

329
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,620
this stuff which is just a piece of

330
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,830
aluminum with some switches and a Tesla

331
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,590
inside it it looks like the schematic is

332
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,200
roughly this hardware is just buttons

333
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,680
then they connect to the tassel which

334
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,690
has a socket connection to a server

335
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,180
running on my laptop which just converts

336
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,940
the signal to a MIDI signal basically I

337
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,330
wanted to put do to create a MIDI signal

338
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,880
on my Tesla but it doesn't support it

339
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,460
yet because the node libraries are just

340
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,880
bindings to the native core MIDI or the

341
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,010
windows engine experience so now I'm

342
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,350
just having a socket connection between

343
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,790
my laptop and my my pedals and hopefully

344
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,870
they will work because yeah Internet

345
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,980
network other web MIDI API is very

346
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,870
simple you just request MIDI access you

347
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,020
get a list of devices and then you

348
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,280
basically just choose the device you

349
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,750
want in this example I take the first

350
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,850
one but they have name so you can just

351
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,880
search for the name of your device let's

352
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,049
see if it works

353
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:50,659
I just turned off my inputs which is

354
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:56,569
nice I can just

355
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:01,499
all of the effects on my pedalboard

356
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:05,159
which is me you can you can just buy me

357
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,079
the pedals and use it but where's the

358
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,189
fun and that's just created yourself and

359
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:18,370
this is the end of the presentation

360
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:25,500
thank you if any of you guys are

361
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,720
interested if a few project and get up

362
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,490
which is the audio effects library or

363
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,960
the pedal board the little app you saw

364
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,970
the oscilloscope which is to create the

365
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,340

367
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,179
early so maybe questions is somebody

else who wants to come and play this

369
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,779
week we could do a Q&A or you could just

370
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:57,120
do it like a concert you know why that's

371
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,519
not going to happen they won't have any

372
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,340
questions I'll bring the microphone to

373
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,639
you

374
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:09,480
hopefully it's not gonna feedback hi

375
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,600
awesome presentation thank you how's the

376
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,110
latency it's sometimes really bad

377
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,440
sometimes super good it's depends on the

378
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,299
amount of tops fear you're running in

379
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,279
your Chrome or in whichever bus you're

380
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,590
using I found out that using Chrome has

381
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,639
the best audio that's because in Firefox

382
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:32,159
you have this annoying sound in the

383
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:34,110
background but Firefox does have very

384
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,299
cool developer tools to debug your audio

385
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,809
chain so I just use them to develop I

386
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:42,240
use the Firefox and Chrome just to

387
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,460
listen to it but yeah the latency like

388
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,470
you asked is just depends on your

389
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,230
computer on your tabs on the amount of

390
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,840
effects you put together that kind of

391
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,610
stuff all right thank you cannot do

392
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,340
superfast solos because you'll hear it a

393
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:10,430
bit later okay

394
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:19,390
hottest one

395
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,650
I want an extended demo please it was so

396
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,900
short please show us the pedal again

397
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,090
that was so nice I want to get a video

398
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,290
please just do something with the guitar

399
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,240
and use the pedal please that's my

400
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:47,130
question

401
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,300
I'm very happy is for questions so what

402
00:19:53,300 --> 00:20:00,590
do you want to hear let's just create

403
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,710
some dirty stuff does anybody know where

404
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,760
a nice riff or something that's not a

405
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:18,350
riff that the whole song

406
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:26,650
quite hard because create a lot of cool

407
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,700
sounds and just play around with the

408
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,900
stuff let's see what we get for maybe we

409
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,130
get noise maybe we get something very

410
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:48,669
funky I really love flanger by its

411
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:51,250
sister makes everything seems like it's

412
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,320
a psychedelic rock band was playing then

413
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,919
it's all the pedals and all the settings

414
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,090
but I don't think that's interesting if

415
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:14,039
I can 70 be kidding I'm a musician
