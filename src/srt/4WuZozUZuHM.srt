1
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,150
That's it!

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:22,920
Now I'm a star.

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
I'm done!

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Thank you.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:35,260
Okay, today I'm going to be talking about
JavaScript is for everyone.

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,870
That wasn't supposed to happen!

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,010
And also that wasn't supposed to happen!

8
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,780
Okay, hello.

9
00:00:48,780 --> 00:01:00,039
I'm Kenigbolo Stephen, a lead and advocate.

10
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,030
I'm also the community manager for Code Afrique
story, and I will tell you about the Code

11
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,830
Afrique story and why JavaScript is for everyone.

12
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,270
You can find me on Twitter.

13
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,860
Please don't ask me how I came about that
handle!

14
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,190
It's one of those things I don't really want
to talk about!

15
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,910
But, yes.

16
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,520
I work in Finland.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,290
Who knows about Finland?

18
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,290
That's nice.

19
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,290
This audience is way better.

20
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,819
In Finland, we don't smile, so it is do you
know about Finland?

21
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,619
That's pretty much it!

22
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,130
I'm going to be talking about JavaScript being
for everyone.

23
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,539
This is basically how it's going to go.

24
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:47,400
I will talk about what Code Afrique is, why
we do what we do, an important disclaimer:

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,649
you may not like a lot of the things I'm going
to say today but I think it's important to

26
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:52,780
state these things.

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,200
There's been a huge dysfunction between teaching
JavaScript and getting beginners into the

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,310
industry.

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,830
I'm going to talk about the team behind Code
Afrique.

30
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,530
I'm going to be telling you how we teach JavaScript.

31
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:14,840
I'm going to tell you about Amber, how the
conventions of configuration have changed.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,060
Beginner concepts that we used Ember to do,
and a history of where we came from and how

33
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,560
we decided to go with this.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,519
What is Code Afrique?

35
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,790
Nothing fancy, just giving back to the community.

36
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,319
It's a bunch of students, doing a masters
in software engineering.

37
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,689
We figured out the problem in Estonia and
decided to get together to solve it.

38
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm going to tell you what we did.

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,470
What do we do, and why do we do what we do?

40
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,489
Who understands what this means?

41
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,730
Okay.

42
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,469
Very few hands.

43
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:07,269
But this basically explains why I'm giving
this talk.

44
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:14,909
In case you missed it in my previous slide,
I used the word "under represented" highlighted

45
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:17,870
in red for a reason.

46
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,379
I would like to redefine this word.

47
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,110
I see myself as a marginalised person.

48
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,859
In 2015, I was doing a Masters in software
engineering?

49
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:27,859
In Estonia.

50
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:36,939
We have a lot of people of colour in the country,
not so many but a significant number.

51
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:40,519
The issue was it was difficult to get jobs,
right?

52
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,040
There were a lot of people who wanted to get
into the tech space and it was difficult to

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,999
get in and the reason was we had created this
barrier for them, assuming that everyone had

54
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:54,420
the same cognitive abilities.

55
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,499
This is a bias, a lot of us have.

56
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:59,370
We don't necessarily do it intentionally,
but this is it.

57
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:06,219
A random question: how many people who make
tutorials or teach people think about learning

58
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:10,489
disabilities like ADHD, for example?

59
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,489
Very few hands.

60
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,209
How many people think about people who are
not really able to learn not because they're

61
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,070
not smart enough, but because they didn't
have the same privileges that you had?

62
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,460
Do you ever think of that?

63
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,020
How many people here got their first computers
before 15?

64
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,370
Okay.

65
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,540
You see these hands?

66
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,360
I never got a computer before 15.

67
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,060
So, what whether I like it or not, I didn't
get the advantages that others had.

68
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,960
This is why we came about Code Afrique to
actually try to boost that gap and give people

69
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,380
the ability to actually get into the industry
without thinking so much.

70
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,330
Yesterday, something happened, and I basically
wanted to call out this.

71
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,600
I thought it was important.

72
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,280
I would like to change the narrative of we
being under represented.

73
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,060
I quote Brian Lyells when he says you're not
under represented before, you're over represented.

74
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:13,200
I'm sorry, but this is fact.

75
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,650
We are black, indigenous people of colour
in IT, and we are supposed to be here.

76
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,380
We're not here as a quota, we are here because
we're supposed to be here.

77
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,010
We don't want to use negatives to address
ourselves in the industry, we want to be seen

78
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,120
as people managing our lives, not under represented.

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,020
Hopefully, I hope that by the end of this
talk everything thinks this back and puts

80
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,890
it on the back of their minds.

81
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,900
Would you believe me when I tell you there
are a lot of amazing ideas that because it

82
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,400
belongs to a person of colour or a marginalised
community?

83
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,800
How many people actually believe this?

84
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,830
It is always difficult when you need to go
and talk for funds when you belong to a specific

85
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,090
demographic.

86
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,520
It's not as easy as a lot of people think.

87
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,620
This it is one of the reasons where we decided
we want to bring this community to get people

88
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,370
together, people who belong to these under
represented groups and then teach them JavaScript

89
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,280
in such a way where they don't need to be
so much worried about the toxicity we have

90
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
not industry.

91
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,940
They could just come and learn, and afterwards
explore.

92
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,140
So, yes, like everyone else, I think we all
deserve an equal chance.

93
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,950
It might not be nice, it might not be comfortable
for some people, but we all deserve an equal

94
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,950
chance.

95
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm not sure about pizza and - I'm a pizza
person, so maybe the Americans may not be

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,590
so happy but I like pizza more than ... we're
a bunch of regular people.

97
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,940
The folks who work at Code Afrique, that's
Gabriel.

98
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,400
This is Sunday.

99
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,000
And this is Victor, all senior software engineers.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,530
Two work in Canada and one works in Estonia.

101
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,570
We started Code Afrique together in 2016,
and we've been going strong there ever since.

102
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,030
I'm going to give an honourable mention to
a friend called Fortuna based in Estonia.

103
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:19,180
He helped us discover a better way to actually
accommodate people when we need to teach JavaScript.

104
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,930
Now, one of the biggest things we found out
about JavaScript and getting people into the

105
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,860
industry is the conceptions of pure evil.

106
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,280
One of the preconceptions is that JavaScript
is easy.

107
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,030
You can say that when you're not a beginner.

108
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,970
If you've never written a line of code, programming
is never as easy as you think, and this is

109
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,810
something I want us to remember when you have
to teach people.

110
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,860
The fact that you understand it does not necessarily
mean they will understand it the way that

111
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,860
you do.

112
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,360
The fact that you have the ability to assimilate
things does not necessarily mean they would

113
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,680
have the ability to assimilate it in the way
that you will.

114
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,860
The JavaScript community out here, there is
no control of people grasping the concepts.

115
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,360
This is not the fault of JavaScript but down
to the fact that people learn differently.

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,830
Where we've made the mistake is not taking
time to find ways to accommodate the different

117
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,720
type of people who need to learn.

118
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,021
We have been very mainstream in the way we
teach JavaScript, and I'm hoping that, as

119
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:24,270
we go back today to mentor people, those who
have junior developers, we take this into

120
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,960
consideration about who we are teaching what
the situations might be.

121
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,460
Sometimes, it's not only about learning disabilities,
it could be emotional, mental, physical.

122
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,580
Let's always put that into consideration when
we need to teach.

123
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:45,420
Now, JavaScript does not have to be complicated
as much as we tend to make it complicated.

124
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,810
I strongly believe it doesn't have to be.

125
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,370
JavaScript is a beautiful language.

126
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,850
I didn't come from a JavaScript background.

127
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,629
I came from a C++ background but of since
I got here I don't want to go back because

128
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,370
I love being here.

129
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,540
However, we have created a barrier that makes
it difficult for people to come into the industry,

130
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:08,029
and just before I go, a quick question: how
many people here work in front-end development?

131
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,040
Awesome.

132
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,100
That's a lot of hands.

133
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Okay.

134
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,999
This should have been named JSConf front-end!

135
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:22,279
How many people as front-end engineers have
had to traverse a binary tree in their regular

136
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,999
day jobs?

137
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,249
That's very few hands.

138
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:27,689
I can't even count.

139
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:33,759
How many have had to use the big notification
in the regular jobs and front-end engineers?

140
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,759
Also very few hand.

141
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:41,060
Now, think about it: why do we need to actually
make beginners scared of getting into the

142
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,649
industry by bombarding them with all this
information instead of getting them in and

143
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,579
easing them into learning?

144
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,190
Why can't we do that?

145
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,029
Why do we always have to make it so complicated?

146
00:09:52,029 --> 00:10:00,300
So we designed a simple way to actually teach
beginners, and it's basically this: because

147
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,720
whether you like it or not, these are the
three building blocks of JavaScript.

148
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,810
The moment you can understand these three
concepts, it makes it easier for you to go

149
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:13,709
on and explore different other things.

150
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:21,509
We basically decided to use the pattern explaining
variables and objects and methods going through

151
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:22,509
this way.

152
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,120
We think it's easier.

153
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,139
It has worked for us and enabled us to get
out the 15 students we initially take, get

154
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:33,579
nine of them into the industry, they're good
engineers, they're still young, they still

155
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,389
have a lot of time to improve, but they're
learning, and it has shown us that there is

156
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:41,540
a possibility to actually ease people into
the industry without necessarily complicating

157
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,670
the entrants.

158
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,900
We need to think about the different type
of people.

159
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,170
We need no to think about the different communities
and find a way to get everyone in without

160
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,889
necessarily unintentionally excluding them.

161
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:02,550
Now, the biggest problem we face when we need
to teach people, and this is not - this is

162
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:09,470
by no means me lashing out at anyone, or any
particular thing, I'm just saying the JavaScript

163
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,490
community has grown so big, and something
that is supposed to be a huge help for us

164
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:20,259
has unfortunately turned out to be a problem,
and that is that?

165
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,259
This is it.

166
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,259
Yes.

167
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:24,819
And, again, pretty much frameworks.

168
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:28,810
Frameworks was supposed to make software development
easy.

169
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,699
Frameworks were basically - we started building
frameworks to enable people become productive

170
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:37,819
easier.

171
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:43,180
Unfortunately, we have started making frameworks
that by making it more complicated for people

172
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,529
to get in, and this is now not a lash-out
to anyone or framework.

173
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:53,300
In my team, we use four different JavaScript
frameworks for different projects.

174
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,600
Every one has its pros and cons.

175
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,369
I think that it's important that when we build
this, and even when we make tutorials, we

176
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:06,579
take into consideration the different type
of people that need to learn.

177
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:13,060
Now, I like Ember, and I'm going to make a
disclaimer: I am not sure I'm not connected

178
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,660
to Ember.

179
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:25,910
I'm only speaking it in the context of how
we use them by giving people simple instructions.

180
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,740
There's something very controversial about
Ember.

181
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,180
I wouldn't say controversial but a diverse
opinion.

182
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,800
It's a convention over configuration.

183
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,120
A lot of people feel that this is not so good.

184
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,259
And that's not justified.

185
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,259
They have their reasons.

186
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:46,930
A lot of people do believe that conventional
over configuration is quite important, and

187
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,550
they have their reasons.

188
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:54,720
Now, starting in Code Afrique, we actually
went ahead to teach people in terms of the

189
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,399
different things that we needed to show them.

190
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,949
What we discovered was that it was easier
to actually use Ember because we could give

191
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,879
them a set of instructions to follow.

192
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,899
One of the most important things you enjoyed
as a beginner was writing the line of code

193
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:09,899
and seeing it work.

194
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:16,170
We gave them an opportunity to see their work
progress, enjoy that excitement, and then

195
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,769
go on to dig deeper behind the basics, why
this works the way it works, with , instead

196
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:23,949
of working in the reverse pattern.

197
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,259
So typical pit stalls we encountered with
trying to use frameworks.

198
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:29,509
Lazy-loading.

199
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,339
Too many computer science concepts that is
front-end development.

200
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,709
It doesn't have to be so complicated.

201
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:36,930
Come on.

202
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,769
Some frameworks seemed to be front-end frameworks
designed for back-end developers.

203
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,129
A lot of people here can agree with that,
I'm pretty sure we've all seen it.

204
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,579
You probably know what I'm talking about.

205
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:51,170
Yes, and then some things aren't designed
for beginners, it's true.

206
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,910
As much as we would like to say it is, it's
just not designed for beginners.

207
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,910
It's not beginner-friendly.

208
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,380
There are tons of other things but I will
skip that and talk about the basic ones.

209
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,590
At this point, I'm going to play a nice video.

210
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,590
Hopefully, the musical part is actually removed.

211
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,590
This was a video made by one of our students
and I promised him I was going to play here.

212
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,590
>> Thank you.

213
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,590
God bless America.

214
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,590

technologies and frameworks.

Oh.

242
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,590
She is so beautiful.

Mmm.

I want another one.

There you go.

246
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,590
Precious.

247
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,590
Beautiful.

248
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,590


249
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,590

250
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,590
This is Libia Roogie.

Come on, there he is!

252
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,590
All right, very good to meet you.

Here we go.

254
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,590
[Laughter].

255
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,590
"
>> Okay, so I'm just going to round up.

256
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,590
That was pretty much it.

257
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,590
I would say a big thank you to all the people
who work with Ember guides, teaching Ember

258
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,590
and JS has been amazing because of the way
the documentation is designed.

259
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,590
A huge shout-out to your communities.

260
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,590
The documentations are totally amazing and
they make teaching easy for us.

261
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,590
Routers, and this is no beef against any framework,
but not having to teach people about routing,

262
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,590
not having to tell people listen, I need you
to go and install this particular framework

263
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,590
router to get started helps us a lot because
it eliminates the need for people to worry

264
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,590
about that.

265
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,590
When they want to learn about routers is doing
it in their own time.

266
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,590
They want to get productive and learn code.

267
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,910
Handle - data binding.

268
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:09,949
We can't actually teach data-binding without
teaching data-binding.

269
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:14,809
Basically, they can get productive and understand
it and when they want to dig deeper, they

270
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:19,389
have a better overview of what data binding
should be and how it should work.

271
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:20,389
Lastly, convention.

272
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:25,600
We all have different ideas about convention,
but as someone who has taught Ruby on Rails,

273
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:35,420
and em-R Ember, I think for beginners, it's
important to give learners a set of guidelines

274
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,140
to use and work in.

275
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,829
Just I'm going to show a couple of little
things.

276
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:46,709
So this is pretty much lazy-loading in Ember.js.

277
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,160
This is how straightforward it was.

278
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,500
I only need to explain what Lazy Loading is
and show them is.

279
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,949
No disrespect to Angular, if I want to do
this in Angular, it's not so straightforward.

280
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:05,819
This is one of the issues we face.

281
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:10,439
You need to make sure you can go into a lot
of core concepts.

282
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:14,959
Going into a lot of core concepts for people
you're trying to get into the industry might

283
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,100
just be a way to chase them away.

284
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,190
So using simpler methods, using this kind
of method, and using convention over configuration,

285
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,189
we can do this and show it to to them better.

286
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:32,259
I hope a lot of frameworks will make it easier
for people getting into the industry.

287
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:36,579
This is a simple routing function in Ember.js.

288
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,740
This is a simple explanation.

289
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,009
This is all I need to tell the student that
how the routing itself would work, and this

290
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:48,160
would make logical sense because it follows
systematically the way it will flow.

291
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,369
Lastly, this is a code written by someone
who learned JavaScript for four days.

292
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:58,110
He literally just learned objects, variables,
and functions, and then he came up with this.

293
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,519
I promised him I was going to put this up
there because four days in, I couldn't write

294
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,519
this.

295
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:10,030
Somehow, we are actually doing something right,
and I'm hoping as we go back, we learn to

296
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,300
actually help people learn properly.

297
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,880
Moving forward, we've run the code to reload.

298
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:25,829
We still have Code Afrique as an online version
and Reload is a boot camp for people who identify

299
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,100
as marginalised groups.

300
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,049
You can find us on Twitter.

301
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,490
If you would like to be a mentor to some of
our students, we would love that.

302
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,640
And many thanks to the following organisations.

303
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,490
The Association of African Students in Estonia.

304
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:46,510
They gave us to the - and the Talin Institute
of Technology.

305
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:53,779
Our classrooms are located in the institute,
and a huge thanks to my company.

306
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:59,880
I'm paid to be a developer-advocate that doesn't
need to come and talk about ... but I - our

307
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,360
huge thanks to them.

308
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,750
Lastly, I wanted to mention about mentoring,
because this is also a fundamental part of

309
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,780
JavaScript that we have actually forgotten.

310
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,299
Now, a huge shout out to the node.js community.

311
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,019
They have an awesome mentoring system.

312
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:21,211
It does have a little flaw and hopefully sometime
I'm going to bring that up when I can, but

313
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:28,520
I just wanted to point out that if you know
you mentor anyone, if you know you're a senior

314
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,740
engineer and you have junior engineers in
your team, mentoring is not good enough.

315
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,850
You need to open them to your network.

316
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,250
You need to give them opportunities.

317
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,370
It's wanting to say yes, I'm a teacher, I
have four mentees.

318
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:48,169
How many are working?

319
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,500
It's important that we keep this at the back
of our mind when we teach.

320
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,919
It's another thing to pass knowledge and another
thing to give people confidence.

321
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,820
While you mentor people, giving them opportunities.

322
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:14,630
I used to be at fault for this because I have
seven meant yes, sir - what was I missing?

323
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:21,169
On linked linked, if I see a job, I - if - I
can say all seven are working today.

324
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:26,160
One will be a senior engineer, he's just within
three years be he is smart because he has

325
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,669
a CSS background.

326
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,250
It's important that we open up people to our
networks.

327
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:37,270
I'm highlighting the mentees that we have
at Code Afrique because they came from a very

328
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,270
different background.

329
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:47,160
He's a journalist, and when I look down there,
he actually also doesn't have a CS degree.

330
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,230
She started studying marketing, but they're
all engineers now, and we're really proud

331
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,279
of what they do.

332
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,450
I hope we can encourage people to get into
tech this way.

333
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:05,970
Lastly, I'm going to point this: who has had
this raised before? - who has heard this phrase

334
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,970
before?

335
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,140
What this means is that it is all about sharing
what has been bothering you for a long time.

336
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,159
Mostly things that, you know, you usually
don't have anyone to talk about, but you would

337
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,159
like to talk about it.

338
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,039
The reason why I do this is because every
time I come to a conference, I have students

339
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:27,179
who are back home listening, and I want the
experienced developers here to please go on

340
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:34,059
Twitter and talk about your most vulnerable
times, talk about those things that you can't

341
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:35,059
remember.

342
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:39,750
You can go on Twitter, for example, every
single time I need to Google how to use the

343
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,679
reduce function because despite the fact I've
been programming for over five years, I don't

344
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:45,679
seem to grab it.

345
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,919
I have to check out the reduce function.

346
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:53,970
When you say this to young people, it doesn't
matter the age, but people who are young in

347
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:54,970
the industry.

348
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,880
You give them some sort of confidence and
let them know we're not all Superman.

349
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:04,299
Everyone makes mistakes and has a part they're
not comfortable with.

350
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,039
I want you please to share your stories.

351
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:10,190
I'm going to go on Twitter quickly and post
this.

352
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,090
So please indulge me.

353
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,960
I prepared this tweet just ahead of time.

354
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,490
You can go on the there and write the themes
that you consider to be the most vulnerable

355
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,360
things as a senior developer, what things
do you forget regularly?

356
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,529
As a senior developer, no matter how much
I think I know, I really don't know shit,

357
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:39,220
unfortunately, because, when I went to EmberConf
I sat with Yehuda who was a role model for

358
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:49,039
me, when he started to contribute - I realised,
like, oh, boy, I have a long way to go, you

359
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,039
know?

360
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,539
So please share your stories with them, and
encourage them and make them understand that

361
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:55,990
it's okay to make mistakes.

362
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,691
We all make mistakes regardless of how many
years experience we have not industry, everyone

363
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:05,980
makes mistakes and you can learn from them
and be better.

364
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,020
I started going back.

365
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,440
And with that, I say thank you.

366
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,070
You can find me on GitHub, and Twitter, and
you can send me an email.

367
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,700
The word you see there is the one thing I
want you to learn about Finland today - how

368
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,960
we say thank you.

369
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,620
Thank you very much!
