Which are gonna be Shocking and hurtful

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,720
Which are not directed at you at all

45
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,220
Ok?

46
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,320
JavaScript is a hot mess

47
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,400
All they could do is add more problem... problem..

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,760
And they are busy doing that

49
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,220
That's only because of it's the worst API

50
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,360
ever developed in the history of computer science

51
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,320
Now the problem with

00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,000
Now... Now the problem with...

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,860
As everybody knows... Right?

54
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,440
With JSON...

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,700
is that when you get a huge payload from your server

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,600

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,680

Let me gain something

63
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,860

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,720
Because, we needed more terms that no one understands

68
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,840
Is... Is... is Just from generic information

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,260
You know this is not scary at all...

70
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,760

inputs and outputs from the program

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,700
kind of like the concept of time
