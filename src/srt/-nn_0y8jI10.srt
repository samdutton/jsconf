presentation actually I made a game

5
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,660
because it's more fun to talk about

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,020
games while you play game right and we

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,060
had a whole bunch of really hardcore

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,640
technical talks yesterday and today

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,460
morning so just like treat it like a

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,950
break for your brain or something like

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,980
that and there is one issue I made a

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,940
game on the oh yeah console and I just

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:14,269
Jas and it's maybe it's hard to like get

50
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,709
this from the name but that's the

51
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,250
JavaScript conference and Antarctica and

52
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,650
I've been there last year check the

53
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,079
venue and you have followed Antarctic

54
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,130
Jays and twitter for more info I hope it

55
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,410
will take place next year around

56
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,640
Antarctic summer and i'm also addicted

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,920
to TV shows i watch tons of crappy

58
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,739
TV shows all the time I have my github

59
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,340
repository of a list so so far since

60
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,980
tuta since 2010 I watched more than

61
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,470
4,000 episodes and that's more than

62
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,480
2,000 hours and if you if you go there

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,109
and see that there is one show that you

64
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,120
know and it's good and I don't have it

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,859
on the list just fork the repo and send

66
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:06,620
me pull request please I'm not kidding

67
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,200
really ok so as I said I didn't make a

68
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,729
game I made I me didn't make any stuff

69
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:26,640
okay you haven't seen that sorry mm-hmm

70
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,099
okay that wasn't really as I said that's

71
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:38,060
not really stable thing ok so here we

72
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,150
are again so the game is more or less

73
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,410
about

74
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,150
it's Thomas somewhere here can I switch

75
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,550
to my computer because I don't think it

76
00:04:51,550 --> 00:05:01,090
want to cooperate today ok so so oh one

77
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,830
more thing even if I'm a game developer

78
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm not really good player so I second

79
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,490
gaming and like playing and talking in

80
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,160
the same time it's impossible for me so

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,160
i will probably yeah i improved this but

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,720
I improved the wrists bound algorithm

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,580
recently so it should work better ok so

84
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,160
the game is like I just traveled through

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,200
the oh it's actually just slightly

86
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,670
changed site of on game start 2012 and

87
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,890
you control this astronaut inside the

88
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,560
spaceship with lasers and talk to people

89
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,530
this yellowish things are kind of people

90
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:51,430
ok so i will talk today about game

91
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,700
consoles and browsers and games so first

92
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,330
time i get interest in like I get an

93
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,510
idea that maybe it's possible to okay

94
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,150
that the idea of running HTML or any

95
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,920
even JavaScript on the game console it's

96
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,740
kind of new thing we I mean we have

97
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,110
javascript in like almost everywhere

98
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,950
like in the server side mobile phones

99
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,640
fridge printers whatever right so why

100
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:31,930
not on the game console and the first

101
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,830
attempt to do that I ever seen was

102
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,520
running JavaScript games on xbox so xbox

103
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,880
house has this thing called XNA so you

104
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,070
can basically run your own game britain

105
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,040
in.net and XNA framework on xbox 3060

106
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,560
and there is this small thing called

107
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:06,530
Jurassic and it's Wow no no no yes there

108
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,620
is this thing called Jurassic and that's

109
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,740
a JavaScript engine for.net so there is

110
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,830
this guy that made an impact jas game

111
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,980
engine Dominic's a black ski and he made

112
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,310
the first attempt to run his own game on

113
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,430
xbox so basically what he did was okay

114
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,120
yeah what he did was cross compiling

115
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,400
JavaScript to the.net bytecode and then

116
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,750
ran it on XNA and he has outstanding

117
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,220
performance of six seconds per frame so

118
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,050
that's not actually what we want to

119
00:07:43,050 --> 00:08:03,510
achieve in games and okay okay yeah so

120
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,370
but as you could see for 30 seconds it's

121
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,070
possible to run JavaScript game on the

122
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,530
oh yeah console so oh yeah is this small

123
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,960
cheap not cheap inexpensive device that

124
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,650
run Android so you can run your android

125
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,710
games on this game console and there is

126
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,530
this cross compiler record kun je yes

127
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,700
it's made by the some startup from Spain

128
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,159
I mean they're now starter from Silicon

129
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,560
Valley it's always happens with European

130
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,140
startups after a while and they so it's

131
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,450
really easy I mean everything you need

132
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,400
oh I don't have it but so you need to

133
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,570
believe me that everything you need to

134
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,900
do is just write your game like you do

135
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,940
for the browser compress it to one zip

136
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,740
file uploaded to cocoon Jes cloud server

137
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,290
service and then download the APK file

138
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,300
for Android and it kind of works as you

139
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,330
could see I have no idea why it worked

140
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,580
for 30 seconds I I really

141
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,750
it worked in my room on my TV anyway so

142
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:25,080
that was a quite like new thing that but

143
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,520
why actually we want to do that like how

144
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,020
far is our console from our mobile phone

145
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,640
like what's the difference today I mean

146
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,050
okay the difference is obvious right you

147
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,870
know one has do you don't like work with

148
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,340
your PlayStation in your backpack like

149
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,290
most of the time and you don't play it

150
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,330
in subway but from the hardware point of

151
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:59,400
view like ps2 was 53 times worse device

152
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,850
than ZT open the cheapest Firefox OS

153
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,310
phone now so when when I when I saw this

154
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,060
thing I thought okay so why mobile

155
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,490
phones are not our game consoles now

156
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,380
right simple idea so oh I forgot one

157
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,800
slide because we talked about how to run

158
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,130
our JavaScript things on the console and

159
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,090
what about running console games in the

160
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:40,290
browser so oh this a lot of thing

161
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,240
doesn't work today but it so there is a

162
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,870
how many of you ever heard of Emscripten

163
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,430
okay so Emscripten is lv v m2 JavaScript

164
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,900
compiler so you can compile your C code

165
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,200
or Python code or whatever code to

166
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
JavaScript and run it in the browser and

167
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,790
we have this subset of JavaScript called

168
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,260
a sm j s so it's it's low level

169
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,210
javascript with memory management and

170
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,930
things like that so recently we created

171
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:23,850
this demo of the Unreal Engine in HTML

172
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,930
in

173
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,589
javascript is rendered using WebGL and

174
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:32,550
it was written in C so as far as i know

175
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:38,790
and it's kind of yes so you can work

176
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,670
look around and all this take in a

177
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:49,760
real game blah blah blah okay nice so so

178
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,880
what's the other important difference

179
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,860
between the browser and the mobile phone

180
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,959
so for me like the game changer is the

181
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,520
support of all the web api so we do have

182
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,360
now most in firefox OS but well when

183
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,430
they will became part of the standard

184
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,260
will have them in all the mobile

185
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,570
browsers and not only mobile browsers or

186
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:20,850
also desktop browsers as well so what

187
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:30,150
exactly like okay give me a second if i

188
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,700
want to create a game for the conference

189
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,100
next time please punch me in the face

190
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,550
okay so we have using web AP is we have

191
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,190
the main advantage for me is that we

192
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:49,170
have different ways to manage to handle

193
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,959
the input player input so on your gaming

194
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,640
console you just have your ipad and

195
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,820
that's all like oh this ridiculous

196
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,310
connect thing if you are too lazy to do

197
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,190
jogging in real life you can run in the

198
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,400
front of your TV right but in the

199
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,260
browser we have like the unlimited

200
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,950
actually ways of handling input so

201
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,650
probably all of you know accelerometer

202
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,540
right like we can use accelerometer from

203
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,100
our mobile browsers so like user don't

204
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,350
need to use a keyboard mouse or touch

205
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,320
events to control your game it just tilt

206
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,610
the phone and that's all I mean it was a

207
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,769
big thing

208
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,369
when it was invented now it's not really

209
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:45,670
original but yeah let's that's the first

210
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,559
thing so what about geolocation so

211
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:57,220
geolocation is more or less the GPS API

212
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,009
in your browser and there is whole bunch

213
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:03,990
of games that use them like I don't know

214
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,059
that's one of the game in where you need

215
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,689
to run to the particular place faster

216
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:17,379
than your friends or tour force is quite

217
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,540
nice it's like a gangster game but in

218
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,279
real life it doesn't sound very good

219
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,470
it's in the real and fire oh you get the

220
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,679
idea so and also like one of my

221
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,529
favorites but I couldn't find it is

222
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:34,269
there was a hackathon in war so a couple

223
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,300
of years ago and one of the like 48

224
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,910
hours to build the html5 game and one of

225
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,429
the team builds a geolocation paint

226
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:44,379
application so you just run with your

227
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,990
phone and then you could see like your

228
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:53,350
drawing on the map was kind of fun okay

229
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,970
sorry because I have no idea where my

230
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:03,180
next slide is okay upper platform

231
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:37,129
Oh No XC know yeah oh wait okay

232
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,699
yay so we have the gamepad API as well

233
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,639
so you can control your game with

234
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,819
gamepad so that's boring that's not

235
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:52,239
really something you want to do on the

236
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,639
browser because we have consoles for

237
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,719
that but if you write html5 game for the

238
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,269
oh yeah console for example you can run

239
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:08,049
it in you can you need to implement the

240
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:11,709
gamepad ap either and the API actually

241
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,689
like it'sit's though if you want to

242
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:19,539
teach your kids how not to create the

243
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:22,089
architecture of an API just show them

244
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:26,259
the w3c documents about the gamepad API

245
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:29,079
because it's like the worst API ever we

246
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,689
don't have events there but you need to

247
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,839
pull on every frame to huge array of

248
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,919
buttons and check if the button is 0 or

249
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:46,239
1 that makes no sense at all yep so

250
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:51,189
which one is the next Oh tight I hate

251
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:57,579
this part just in case yeah okay so what

252
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:02,259
about getusermedia so there is this

253
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:06,389
thing in the browser called WebRTC and

254
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:10,839
part of WebRTC is get user so WebRTC was

255
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,289
created to create skype like

256
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:15,220
applications inside the browser's you

257
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,769
have peer to peer connection and part of

258
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:21,779
this API is the get user media it's

259
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,259
access to your video and audio of the

260
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:30,580
browser so how many of you seen my talk

261
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,259
from last year okay like five people

262
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:41,799
great so it will be fun so I create the

263
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,369
really simple example of how get user

264
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:48,800
media works so that's the video

265
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,670
part those are just the puzzles like you

266
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,980
just need to grab one and put grab one

267
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,730
and grab one and put in the proper place

268
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,090
if you don't know where to put it you

269
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,460
can cheat like okay my hand is in here

270
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:20,680
yeah yep hmmm

271
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:26,630
voila yeah so that's the simple example

272
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,330
of how video can I mean that's not

273
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,920
really useful example but you get the

274
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,420
idea right and so how we can that's the

275
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,460
hardest part of this level I hate it but

276
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,500
how we can okay it's nice that we can

277
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,660
access the the video but how we can

278
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,770
actually use it so my idea from last

279
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,360
year I had to talk about the face

280
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,480
recognition and I created simple example

281
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,700
of so first of all what happens in the

282
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,360
first step is just we draw the stream

283
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,880
from the camera on canvas and run the

284
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,100
face detection algorithm there and when

285
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:23,650
the face is detected we stop like yeah

286
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,040
that's the first step so the second one

287
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,790
was we have a texture of the 3d model

288
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,580
from the WebGL game and then when we

289
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,740
detect the face we put the face on the

290
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,720
texture in the place where the face

291
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,680
should be so in this yeah yeah so

292
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,260
now we have a texture with our own

293
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,170
character and the second day third step

294
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:58,970
of course is to put this face on the

295
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,950
real model and so the algorithm detects

296
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,950
where the eyes are and put them in the

297
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,590
glass into the glasses where the nose is

298
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,630
and mouth and things like that so we

299
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,240
have our own 3d model and we can use it

300
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:22,060
in games or whatever

301
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,160
so that was one of the use cases one of

302
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:33,300
the things where you can use the yeah so

303
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,220
but if we can find the face in the video

304
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,650
can we use our heads as game controllers

305
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,380
and I had an example last year and I

306
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,870
think it worked but this year I couldn't

307
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,890
make run I don't know why there is this

308
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:57,840
game hook called head punk oh yeah

309
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,280
that's this and I'm not yeah exactly it

310
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,670
doesn't really work but what happens

311
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,150
there is you play a punk game with your

312
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,820
head that's quite kind of stupid but

313
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,110
it's possible so why not and like the

314
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,890
project i started last year and I'm not

315
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,380
working on it anymore was quite

316
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,220
controversial so if we can detect our

317
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,250
own face on the video can we detect the

318
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,630
face of the animal and there is this

319
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,490
library called kitty door I showed it

320
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,720
last year that you just put the cat's

321
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,120
photo there and it starts looking for it

322
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,080
and voila so we created together with my

323
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,760
friend the prototype of a game that you

324
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:01,890
control of your cat but I mean it was

325
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,440
quite fun for us it wasn't as fun for

326
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,670
the cat because oh I will not say why

327
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:13,650
but anyway you need to trust yeah so

328
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:19,830
where's the next side there i mean the

329
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,180
the game wasn't really a playable there

330
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:29,670
is is it even a word anyway because the

331
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,440
algorithm is really slow so we need like

332
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,230
a second for a frame so

333
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,549
that's not really funny but getusermedia

334
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:41,390
it's not only the video as I said before

335
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,150
it's also and people usually forget

336
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,600
about it it's also about audio so you

337
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,390
can access your microphone as well not

338
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,679
only the camera and so is it possible to

339
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,690
write a game that you control with a

340
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,210
microphone I mean of course it is

341
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,270
everything is possible right but let's

342
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:13,710
try so first of all I need to whoa no no

343
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:23,690
no no

344
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:37,640
whoops sorry

345
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,600
okay so first of all I need to do a

346
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,900
little calibration so please be quiet

347
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:54,090
for a second okay ok and now on three

348
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,740
can you all shout like really loud one

349
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:09,480
two three okay so I stole one of the

350
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,780
open source games example of the impact

351
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,470
j/s engine and I wrote my own plugin

352
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,520
that that blocks the keyboard control

353
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,130
and the character is always running and

354
00:24:26,130 --> 00:25:14,430
it jumps when you scream so let's try

355
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:30,200
okay enough you get the idea yeah so so

356
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,700
we have other web AP ice as well like FM

357
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,540
radio API battery API light sensor API

358
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:44,140
and can we do a game controlled by the

359
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,350
battery status actually we could we can

360
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:55,970
I it's not really smart thing but there

361
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,130
was the guy like almost a hundred years

362
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,840
ago called Greg Mallory and he was the

363
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:10,160
first guy that probably attempt the peak

364
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,700
of Mount Everest but he died when he was

365
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,590
getting back or going there so we don't

366
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,900
know but like three years before he get

367
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,660
there someone asked him man why do you

368
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,330
want to do that and he was like because

369
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:29,210
it's there so I like of course we don't

370
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,400
need to use those AP is for our games

371
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,870
but they're there why not and I actually

372
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,140
don't have a demo I I'm it's a pity but

373
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:50,990
in Firefox OS in Firefox ok so in

374
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,610
Firefox OS simulator when you plug and

375
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,170
unplug your charger or your USB cable on

376
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,640
the phone it triggers an event so it

377
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,220
easy to create a game like to change the

378
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,260
game I did with a microphone for the

379
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,210
battery status API so the character

380
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,890
starts when you plug or unplug your

381
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,540
phone I mean it's make no sense but why

382
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,610
not you cannot do that with your console

383
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:30,870
right and towards next oh my god there

384
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,320
yeah so there is this guy said that

385
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,930
yearly or something like that he's a CEO

386
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,840
of the company called Crytek that's like

387
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,830
the biggest gaming company in the world

388
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,220
or one of the biggest dick sorry they

389
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,220
create the big titles like far cry or or

390
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,870
something else and he said in the Indian

391
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,550
interview last year that the next

392
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,700
console generation will be the last and

393
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:10,240
it's mostly because we have we don't

394
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,240
have so many hardcore gamers now like

395
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,380
regular gamer for for now for this time

396
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,070
is a women in late thirties should I

397
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:25,960
stop already or okay and playing like

398
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,620
twice a day with her mobile phone and

399
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,480
another thing really important is that

400
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,760
we have how many seven billion people in

401
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,210
the world something around that and we

402
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,180
have 10 billion phones and only four

403
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,590
billion toothbrush brushes so mobile

404
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,470
phone like mobile industry is getting

405
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,780
bigger and bigger and the next

406
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,060
generation of the cons of the next

407
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,950
console generation will be just in our

408
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:59,380
pocket because why not like and for the

409
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,910
last thing I want to say it's thank you

410
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:09,940
that's what's all actually
