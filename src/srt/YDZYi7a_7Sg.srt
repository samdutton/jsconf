00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:17,130

reject hello everyone thanks for coming

2
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,930
to our talk we're going to talk about

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,980
today and experience experimental

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,039
performance experience one that involves

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,859
not only the perform on stage but also

6
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,880
you as an actively participating ad hoc

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,600
performers as well so a little bit about

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,239
us first I'm Jocelyn I'm a classical

9
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,510
pianist and composer and here is my

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,180
collaborator I'm drew drew peterson i'm

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,940
a software engineer javascript engineer

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,270
at spotify all right so I was really

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,539
excited about Mouse's talk because music

14
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,039
is really a empathic activity between

15
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,460
the audience and the performer and today

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,729
we're going to do this extend this by

17
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,580
making your mobile phones into makeshift

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,210
instruments all right so a little bit

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,450
about the background i'm running a

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,479
year-long project called synesthesia

21
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,619
playground a project that is

22
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,170
interdisciplinary and collaborative

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,530
involving myself for other composers a

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,920
visual artist and drew here I'll star

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,320
software developer this project is

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,150
commissioning five multimedia works for

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,460
piano which I'll take on to the next

28
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,000
year the goal of this project is to make

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,310
the classical music experience

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,240
accessible dare I say transform the

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,030
classical music experience even to

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,159
something that is interactive fun

33
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,390
relatable and appealing to all audiences

34
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,009
with mobile phones and that's everybody

35
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,940
basically so what is this word here this

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,840
long word synesthesia our five senses

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,670
though we think of them as separate

38
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,170
turns out not to be so distinct when we

39
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,129
hear sounds we often think of space like

40
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:29,290
high-end no sounds we think of colors

41
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:37,330
like bright Oh dull or temperature like

42
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:45,940
warm and I see so some people feel this

43
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,150
intermixing of the senses more acutely

44
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,250
than others and this neurological

45
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,110
phenomenon is called synesthesia so for

46
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,209
instance synesthetes people with

47
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,400
synesthesia might see sounds very

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,860
vividly see colors associated with

49
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,959
specific harmonies or pictures and so on

50
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,840
or have some kind of tactile experience

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,829
when they see colors on here sounds so

52
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:14,890
synesthesia inspires an altogether new

53
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,250
way of listening to music through all

54
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,569
the senses of our bodies so the goal of

55
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,519
synesthesia playground is to get at this

56
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,040
bodily experience appealing to sound

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,980
through other senses now throughout

58
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,319
Western historical thought music has

59
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,340
been debated as a pure abstract

60
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,000
idealized form of art however you cannot

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,970
only listen to music in your mind the

62
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,040
split between mind and body is just an

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,989
artificial divide that takes away from

64
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,560
the fullness of this bodily visceral

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,930
experience in fact the 20th century a

66
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,169
phenomenologist maurice merleau-ponty

67
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:01,000
here goes even a step further and

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,169
associate every knowledge that we have

69
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:06,639
every experience we have in this world

70
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,900
is first and foremost through our body

71
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,569
no thought no emotion if ever away from

72
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,489
the bodily knowledge that you have

73
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,510
acquired throughout years of living so

74
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,120
synesthesia playground aims to celebrate

75
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,789
this bodily experience bringing music

76
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,570
music from the abstract and the head

77
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,800
to this very basic full human experience

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,030
alright so that's the context of

79
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,889
synesthesia playground this year-long

80
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,199
project the piece we're discussing today

81
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,370
is one of the five commissioned works

82
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,080
while the other works deal with the

83
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,930
bodily experience of an individual this

84
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,210
piece we're talking about today involves

85
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,330
the collective experience of

86
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,770
interconnected communal bodies now music

87
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,210
has always been something that humans

88
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,490
have done collectively as a form of

89
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,970
cultural sharing its practiced as a type

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,370
of communal bonding since the beginnings

91
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,620
of the ages whether it be in ceremonies

92
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,590
in churches and late night jam sessions

93
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,880
and so on for this piece our vision is

94
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,270
this type of communal music making we

95
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,789
want to create a collective structured

96
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:25,210
improvisation involving a flexible

97
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,490
amount of people with one guiding

98
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,330
improviser me at the front we aim to

99
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,199
transform the classical piano concert

100
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,510
into a collaborative bonding musical

101
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,940
experience with instruments relevant to

102
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,680
the 21st century our mobile phones so we

103
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,690
decided to use mobile gestural

104
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,470
technologies both in terms of screen and

105
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,539
a seller ometer detected gestures

106
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,240
because it appeals immediately to the

107
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,590
bodily sense of touch and off movement

108
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,419
now what could a particular gesture

109
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:06,750
sound like like a shake or a flash or a

110
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,509
slow scratch what could a certain touch

111
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:19,630
like tickling or tapping sounds like now

112
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,940
in addition the Kinect is going to be

113
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,310
used to detect the pianists movements

114
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,130
they cannot augment the piano by so

115
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,970
using gestures in the air with sounds so

116
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,680
for instance one of the gestures I use

117
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,259
is this very dramatic arm gesture and

118
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:37,810
its associated with a drastic change in

119
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,230
the pace of the music

120
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,400
alright so I'm the pianist at the front

121
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,710
and the audience somehow interacts with

122
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,720
me and you know amongst themselves as

123
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,390
well so now we've got a framework let's

124
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,340
talk a little bit about the content of

125
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,120
the piece visit the set up we have here

126
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,640
actually opens up a lot of opportunities

127
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,810
as well as questions now what is the

128
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,900
relationship between the pianist and the

129
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,640
audience what's the relationship between

130
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,550
the audience members from one to the

131
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,810
other more practical question is how do

132
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,810
I juggle interactivity with kind of

133
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,330
performative satisfaction or

134
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,660
performative sportsmanship now more

135
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,570
philosophically is the issue of game

136
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,320
versus performance so game is about you

137
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,630
know involvement where everyone's

138
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,640
participating doing stuff and

139
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,800
performance involves kind of

140
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,100
spectatorship so is it still a

141
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,680
performance if everyone is a player and

142
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,060
there are no spectators or are the game

143
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,600
players also spectating so on this

144
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,910
spectrum how much of the piece is

145
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,620
actually a performance and how much of

146
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,060
it is a game so with this new kind of

147
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,330
performance / game consists of in place

148
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,729
I've decided to exploit this very

149
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,860
interactive environment by coming up

150
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,250
with a piece about social dynamics

151
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,930
psychology and social behavior so think

152
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,080
of a room of people at a party like Ren

153
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,100
was boat party how do people relate to

154
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,919
each other how do people act in response

155
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,250
to what they hear do you chime in when

156
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,890
people talk or do you fill in silences

157
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,039
when people don't talk in some

158
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,169
situations people choose to talk over

159
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,169
one another well some people just you

160
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,120
know choose to reflect back or imitate

161
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,630
what they hear now self-consciousness is

162
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,700
something we are all familiar with at a

163
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,270
party what do people do in response to

164
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,810
how con

165
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,040
sures of of themselves and in the

166
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,290
presence of an influential individual is

167
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,440
the possibility of just mindless echoing

168
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,190
or emulation so the piece that I've

169
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,339
wrote I've written heightens this bodily

170
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,640
experience of these social interactions

171
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,950
how does it feel to be hesitant and

172
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,640
uncertain anxious self-conscious elf

173
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,970
conscious or confident so I've turned

174
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,380
these kind of social behaviors and

175
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,450
consciousness into sound into a piece of

176
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,720
music alright so back to the concert

177
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,330
hall now we have a room full of people

178
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,970
each with their phones so I've split up

179
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,880
the audience into four quadrants now for

180
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,750
each quadrant or group green red blue

181
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,260
and yellow I devised game like rules for

182
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,490
gesturing with the phones these rules

183
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,589
explore how people act and listen to

184
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:56,510
each other in different social dynamics

185
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:02,480
so here is an example of one of them so

186
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
in this one the audience is asked to be

187
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,030
hyper aware of their own bodies like be

188
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,870
very aware of swallowing your saliva so

189
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,880
which is which is a bodily experience of

190
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,500
being self-conscious being hyper aware

191
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,990
of what you're doing which usually is

192
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,980
automatic so these rules change as the

193
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,750
piece is played as the soundscape

194
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,880
changes the audience is also given

195
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,740
different rules to adapt to the

196
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,380
environment all right and I'm talking so

197
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,540
let's hear some excerpts of the preview

198
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,720
performance we had last week at spectrum

199
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,860
NYC an experimental music venue alright

200
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,310
so the piece

201
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,160
is divided into three sections so this

202
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,390
is the first section which you're

203
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,910
hearing now so this section is called

204
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,029
metals you can hear a lot of metallic

205
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:02,670
down inside the piano stuff you can see

206
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,010
very dark but some some of the people

207
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,160
are raising their phones to admit sound

208
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:18,460
from the mobile phones

209
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,570
the rules of the mobile phones that you

210
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,450
said they have all right so all right so

211
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,149
this is section 2 that was the Kinect

212
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:35,640
gesture to go into section 2 section 2

213
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,050
is called underwater and the audience is

214
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,470
compelled to be self-conscious or hyper

215
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,540
work themselves following the rules on

216
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,850
their phones all right so this is

217
00:11:50,850 --> 00:12:00,089
another example so this is the gesture

218
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,790
going from

219
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:27,350
the underwater section 2 section 3

220
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,660
alright so that's the content and the

221
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,880
kind of lots of it behind the piece but

222
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,330
how did we do it yes so let's find out

223
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,240
the answer in case you're wondering is

224
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,370
just a lot of JavaScript just JavaScript

225
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,550
all over the place here's the setup you

226
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,100
saw a little exercise before I'm going

227
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,180
to be moving pretty quickly because

228
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,040
there's a live demo so forgive me if I'm

229
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,810
speeding but this is actually my brother

230
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,570
and joseline at the piano up at the top

231
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,660
in the middle there's a little like I

232
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,400
looking thing like Curiosity rover at

233
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,080
that's the Kinect looking at Jocelyn and

234
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,030
my brothers on the computer controlling

235
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,740
the Kinect so there were a few

236
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,480
challenges with this thing and it's a

237
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,130
challenge to get any sort of phones to

238
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,780
kind of coordinate this you know this

239
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,790
many phones we had about 30 people which

240
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,680
was a great turnout we're going to have

241
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,180
even more today so hopefully it works

242
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,820
we'll see what happens but I started

243
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,290
writing my own thing and then turns out

244
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,450
Oh someone already wrote a thing that

245
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,850
does this exactly it's a server called

246
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,070
rhizome and you should all check it out

247
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,020
it's amazing it's basically just an

248
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,430
automatic messaging service with

249
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,160
supports for web sockets and osc which

250
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,920
is a sound protocol it does things like

251
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,370
reconnect automatically and also just

252
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,470
does some pub/sub stuff so here's how

253
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,480
like a typical real-time server app

254
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,400
might work you've got the client like a

255
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,590
phone and some server and the client

256
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,300
says like hey what's going on the server

257
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,680
is like there's what's going on sends it

258
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,780
back and then also just like sending

259
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,790
back updates to the client because the

260
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,970
server knows everything about the state

261
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,320
and in this case the server would know

262
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,140
everything about the performance and

263
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,830
that kind of looks like this

264
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,790
topologically in the what we did for

265
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,730
this performance is used instead a

266
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,990
distributed messaging server app which

267
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,000
of course still has a centralized server

268
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,700
still has the rhizome central server but

269
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,860
certain clients are elevated to a super

270
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,110
client status and that's actually where

271
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,450
all of the state and logic of the app

272
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,760
are so a client might tell the server

273
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,490
hey tell me about world events the

274
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,080
server says sure I'll do that when they

275
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,050
come in and then a super client such as

276
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,330
the computer that I was controlling

277
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,910
during the performance which has all the

278
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,530
state and logic and is may be receiving

279
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,600
events from the connect

280
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,310
sends a message to the central server

281
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,410
saying hey everyone there's a new world

282
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,870
event and then the server distributes it

283
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,000
to everyone what this means is that the

284
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,740
central server is really just routing

285
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,199
messages and and doesn't have any logic

286
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,730
built into it and it looks kind of like

287
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,709
this in our performance we had a few

288
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,750
different super clients the conductor

289
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,360
and the performer and we also had other

290
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,190
special clients like the laptop

291
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,649
controlling the Kinect so the Kinect

292
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:05,850
would send a signal to the central

293
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,709
server which routes it to the conductor

294
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,470
because it knows the conductor is said I

295
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,240
want to know about connect events the

296
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,610
conductor goes hey cool this is like

297
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,199
this is like a world event thing I

298
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,490
should do so it sends out a new event

299
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,990
and it gets sent out to all the clients

300
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,259
so just very fairly standard pub/sub and

301
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,540
this is not like a crazy architecture

302
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,130
but it took me a while to figure out and

303
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,540
that's why I'm sharing it with you

304
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,040
because I'm like oh that's how you do

305
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,279
this it's nothing it's something that

306
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,930
crazy and you might be thinking like hey

307
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,370
the conductor always output state to the

308
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,399
client in one direction and you know one

309
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,230
direction state and you just like you

310
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,790
have to mention react well the second

311
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,440
you talk about one direction in state

312
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,540
and i just want to mention it because i

313
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,430
did use it for the views and you're all

314
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,380
going to see it in a little bit it

315
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,370
worked really well to go from the state

316
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,410
coming in to each audience client state

317
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,120
lessly render and then each client is

318
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,430
basically just a terminal that doesn't

319
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,709
know anything but its own potential it

320
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,779
knows what it can render it doesn't know

321
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,509
when it needs to render or how just that

322
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:09,689
it can also use these tools and I'm just

323
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:11,279
going to keep going because you know i'm

324
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,310
sure you all have used these before next

325
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,410
challenge just physical challenge was

326
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,920
networking AKA how many clients can

327
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,509
connect to my Airport Express I'm sorry

328
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:24,029
extreme this guy right down here the

329
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:26,100
answer is 50 you can search high and

330
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,230
wide the internet and you will come up

331
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,360
with 50 it's hard coded so if you want

332
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,079
more you need to do your own Wi-Fi setup

333
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,810
and the author of the rhizome server has

334
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,130
actually written a blog post about how

335
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,990
to do this and it basically involves

336
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,040
custom ApS separate router separate

337
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,810
switch and hooking it all up and

338
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,730
carrying it all for the venue short

339
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,430
answer for us we were expecting no more

340
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,190
than 50 luckily so the airport extreme

341
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,120
yeah brought it home the next challenge

342
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,470
we faced was something I'm calling

343
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,000
audience engineering you might consider

344
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,030
it user experience or user engineering

345
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,640
or something this is this was a complex

346
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,430
piece to get people to buy into for

347
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,720
example they had to connect to a

348
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,240
specific Wi-Fi access point type in a

349
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,819
password visit a web page all on their

350
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,650
phone and check that audio works and

351
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,000
check that they have accelerometers

352
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,250
working all these things so how do we do

353
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,959
this well one thing we did was we just

354
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,180
printed out physical cards that had the

355
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,670
Wi-Fi information on them and it was

356
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,900
still troublesome for people people

357
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,030
still had trouble but it worked out

358
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,040
better the passwords there because you

359
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,530
know you have to have a password when in

360
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,970
New York because otherwise people will

361
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,880
try to steal your free internet and even

362
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,720
though it wasn't connected to the

363
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,920
Internet it would have taken up one of

364
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,320
those 50 slots and last but not least

365
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,810
people well it's really hard to type an

366
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,750
IP address on a phone let alone on a

367
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,060
desktop let alone the phone so I had

368
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,270
them type in playground CO and I did

369
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,820
that by using my own DNS server not my

370
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,560
own i didn't write it I just started it

371
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,170
up it's super simple I had every single

372
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,170
thing any query that people asked going

373
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,020
to pointing at my server so even google

374
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,610
com would have pointed at my server all

375
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,230
their mail and stuff would have gone to

376
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,820
my server so check this out if you're

377
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,470
ever doing some kind of like custom art

378
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,240
piece within an installation you want

379
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,040
people to connect to it it's way easier

380
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,160
than typing in an IP address next

381
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
challenge the connects the connect to

382
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,690
how many of you have used to connect how

383
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,860
many of you have programmed for a

384
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,820
connect Wow awesome so you know that you

385
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,010
know it's really cool super powerful but

386
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,450
for me this boil down to do I really

387
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,550
have to use windows because I'm a Mac

388
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,650
I'm primarily on a Mac and I knew that

389
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,150
carrying laptops around we pretty

390
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,490
difficult and the windows windows is

391
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,330
like you know do you want to program

392
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,620
your own body appendage and figure

393
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,210
tracking and I said yeah that sounds

394
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,220
like a ton of fun do you want to do that

395
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,410
you know what others have spent a PhD

396
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,540
program doing in two weeks and I said

397
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,610
okay fine Windows you win I'll use I'll

398
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,980
use you and in this case it was actually

399
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,200
my brother who did the mostly connect

400
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,970
this is him testing out front and back

401
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,740
detection you can see it knows which

402
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,020
hand is which even though he spins this

403
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,280
is his contact information there if

404
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,140
you're curious

405
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,060
and this is the connect you can see it

406
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,980
it tracking Jocelyn I just want to show

407
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,240
it to you it's way at the bottom there

408
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,000
but it's kind of cool so you'll see her

409
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,120
do the gesture

410
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,080
and it's actually very accurate

411
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,580
and that triggered the section the next

412
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:32,169
part of the piece of the audio okay by

413
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:33,640
the way shaking your phone doing

414
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,169
gestures you'd think these are solved

415
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:37,929
they're not they're totally not they're

416
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,580
really hard there's all these techniques

417
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,700
for doing it I studied a few of them I

418
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,110
didn't have a time to look into all them

419
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,669
but I wanted to walk through at least

420
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:48,659
one which is called dynamic time warping

421
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:50,830
just want to mention it really because I

422
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,360
want to make sure we have time for more

423
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,429
stuff but basically you take a sliding

424
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:56,470
window of events you take a pattern and

425
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,909
then you try to match the events to your

426
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:00,789
pattern and it tries to compensate for

427
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:02,580
the patterns not perfectly matching

428
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,929
which is cool this is a cool paper you

429
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,130
can read about it explains it pretty

430
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,440
well however I did it totally wrong and

431
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,080
it just ended up working by lucky my

432
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,200
lucky chance really so there was that

433
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,820
and in addition one other technique for

434
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,279
gestures that I used was just like

435
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:20,470
taking the magnitude of the vector of

436
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,669
the events as they're coming in and

437
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,830
saying if they are all greater than 1.8

438
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,620
then do it it's a magic number it's just

439
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,590
totally magical and it kind of works but

440
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,480
I would love it to be better

441
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,570
unfortunately slow time and finally won

442
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,120
one thing that was a challenge with the

443
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,480
gestures was reality versus the intent

444
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,010
of the piece the intent of the composer

445
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,279
and the intent of the the you know the

446
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,380
the idea of the music some of these

447
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,909
gestures were really hard to do so

448
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:50,590
instead of doing them we just changed

449
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,409
the gesture which was a compromise that

450
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,270
I was willing to make maybe not joseline

451
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,210
as much but you know we kind of were up

452
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,450
against a wall with some things so now

453
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,399
that we are now that you've gotten

454
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,470
through that tech stuff just because I

455
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,360
thought you might be curious let's do

456
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,830
something or not you're never supposed

457
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,080
to do which is a live demo so I love it

458
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,360
if everyone could try this out we're

459
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,529
going to try a performance this thing

460
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:18,669
right here so everyone pull out your

461
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:20,620
phones has to be a phone can't be a

462
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,070
laptop it can be an iPad or a tablet

463
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:29,140
visit this IP address and hopefully

464
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,960
hopefully this works and the Wi-Fi holds

465
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,460
make sure you're on the

466
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,740
the cat pictures here Wi-Fi if you get a

467
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,580
begin button go ahead and tap it I'm

468
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,560
going to escape out of this for a moment

469
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,590
just so I can make sure that things are

470
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,310
fluxing over here yeah we've got people

471
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,740
connecting so that's good okay that's

472
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:01,100
great here's the IP address again there

473
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,490
we go and when we've got like a

474
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,890
significant amount of people who are

475
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,480
pressing that button and hearing square

476
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,050
waves I want to hear your square waves

477
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:16,220
come on hopefully it were there's one

478
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,270
yes by the way I am asking you to turn

479
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,400
on your phone volume so it's okay if it

480
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,370
rings it's okay if it blew you know it's

481
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:31,760
going to and that's totally fine it's

482
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,980
very slow i'm sure so much javascript is

483
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,230
it coming is it like pausing for some

484
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,070
people like your nice nice it's kind of

485
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:52,190
their sort of okay let's wait like two

486
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,630
minutes and see if we can get everyone

487
00:22:53,630 --> 00:23:01,550
kind of connected also it shows the grid

488
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,490
there and the grid is somewhat arbitrary

489
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,290
but it's basically you know the front is

490
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:12,780
us so the top of your phone is us yeah

491
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,100
is anyone having like just crazy crazy

492
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,660
issues I feel like we're kind of good

493
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:23,020
here oh really it won't stop playing

494
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,920
okay oh no well I do love the sound of

495
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,260
square waves frankly especially in the

496
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,480
morning or the afternoon where are we

497
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:41,710
all right Berlin alright cool

498
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,260
feel like maybe we're yeah we're okay

499
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,090
yeah so obviously this the demo is going

500
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,669
to not have a piano Stan we didn't

501
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:55,929
sponsor my talk so there's going to be

502
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:59,380
kind of like a modified demo where I'm

503
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,090
not going to be really that much

504
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,710
involved so you guys are kind of like an

505
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,520
autonomous system just doing your own

506
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,610
improvising for most of the time but

507
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,770
let's just see something here question

508
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:26,559
Oh question wizard oh no no the the

509
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,980
Wi-Fi of the convention cat pictures

510
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:36,159
here cat pictures here get your cat

511
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,980
pictures actually miles had great ones

512
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:47,679
we had none yeah failing you all all

513
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,840
right I think my socket did die hoo boy

514
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,010
wow it died alright well we'll just try

515
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,289
it again this is how you test scale by

516
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:05,770
the way in production it's actually this

517
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,090
I want to talk about this but it's a

518
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,220
very difficult thing to test to get this

519
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,210
many phones give it a minute get a

520
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,640
minute I should hit the wrong the other

521
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,909
button alright see ya

522
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:35,910
ok

523
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,490
there we go cool we have 64 people

524
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:45,260
connected or so maybe some more cool all

525
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,880
right you just try it yeah all right

526
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,870
let's just try it we're running out of

527
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,520
time I don't want to go over too much

528
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:59,050
here so uh what oh no I'm still getting

529
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,550
requests sort of yeah they're coming in

530
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,770
hmm I mean my we'll see what might have

531
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,860
my laptop can handle it but all right

532
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,750
let's just do later let's try it go

533
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:26,330
ahead oh oh did I again no did the Wi-Fi

534
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,870
actually die

535
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,990
oh no did it did it really die I think

536
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,440
it really died because if my phone

537
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,860
doesn't have Wi-Fi anymore all right

538
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,360
we'll do it from the will do it from the

539
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,809
computer here all right all right here

540
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:49,030
we go so yeah this is hang on a sec hang

541
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,070
I said no it's not it doesn't work that

542
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:58,090
right there we go try that did it quick

543
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:03,750
oh does it not it's a touch you I

544
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,400
it doesn't have click events it has tap

545
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,130
events hang on a sec there's a way to do

546
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:19,120
this this is i use firefox every day

547
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,120
just so you know just not we're in

548
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,530
responsive mode device there we go thank

549
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,890
