started first wait isn't a gangster a

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,440

no this is a talk about gangster rap

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,289
idioms versus open source workflow so

14
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,390
just sit back relax and enjoy the

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,210
metaphor so let's get started first you

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,030
try to make something out of nothing

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,720
starting from scratch an open source

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,670
everyone starts at the same place it

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,560
doesn't matter who you are everyone

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,810
starts with one line of code everyone

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,270
starts with no knowledge everyone starts

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,950
from scratch you're making something out

23
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,220
of nothing you got respect the game

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,080
you're not the first you're not the best

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,340
and you're not going to be the last

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,680
you're only a player in the game the

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,360
sooner you can recognize this and get

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,380
perspective the sooner you can advance

29
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,700
people have come before you people have

30
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,540
come after you you gotta listen to the

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,530
og's the original gangstaz you have to

32
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,479
find mentors you have to ask questions

33
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,180
you have to ask questions to those with

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,740
more experience but you need to keep an

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,340
open mind you need to have a

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,229
bi-directional communication with these

37
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,119
mentors because they have experience

38
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,979
that you don't have and they're going to

39
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,420
be able to tell you things and help you

40
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,670
along the way but at the same time you

41
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,960
need to have an open mind to know that

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,569
their old guy

43
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,249
sirs there are some things that they

44
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:11,390
just haven't done there's new things

45
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,180
that you can improve on so you just need

46
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,730
to keep an open mind knowing that

47
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,959
they're your mentors will be able to

48
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,249
give you information that you might not

49
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,989
know but at the same time it might not

50
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:25,250
necessarily be correct you got to keep

51
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,790
your ears to the street you need to

52
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,310
follow other developers follow projects

53
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,989
stay informed I think one of the biggest

54
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,969
mistakes I see is somebody might toil

55
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:36,469
away at something for two or three

56
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:38,510
months and make it really awesome and

57
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,310
then say oh this is the coolest project

58
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,079
ever and it's like well no it's been

59
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,879
built five other times and you know one

60
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,290
of those initiatives has like a five

61
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,790
hundred thousand dollars behind it and

62
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,680
like you also solve the wrong problem

63
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,889
you need to have perspective you need to

64
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,329
be able to see what's out there you need

65
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,340
to research you can't just say I'm going

66
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,389
to make something and it's gonna be the

67
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:57,859
coolest thing ever it doesn't work like

68
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:03,310
that you got stay on your grind

69
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,159
persistence tenacity follow through you

70
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,989
just have to keep going if you fail you

71
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,269
need to try again if you fail you need

72
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,370
to try again if you fail again you need

73
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,889
to try again if you get it right you're

74
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,859
wrong you got to do it again it's just

75
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:25,020
like if you hit a wall you break it down

76
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,930
everyday i'm hustling you gotta treat

77
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,030
your product is code you gotta treat

78
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,129
your kotas product you got to slang your

79
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:36,019
code it represents you it's what you're

80
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,489
putting out there people don't care

81
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,409
about anything else but the quality of

82
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:40,970
the code does it work or does it not

83
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,430
work is it easy to use is it not easy to

84
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,769
use your code represents you and you got

85
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,669
a slang it you got to put it out there

86
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:53,810
the first one is always free you got to

87
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,819
go free open source you got to put it

88
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,680
out there you have to put an MIT license

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,409
a bsd whatever you want the point is is

90
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:01,759
that people are going to be able to see

91
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,919
your work and sit your code and if they

92
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,150
like it they're going to pay you to do

93
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,409
something else because they know you can

94
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:07,699
do it and you've already proved it to

95
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,439
them so i'm saying you give them the

96
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,129
first one and then they get hooked you

97
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:17,719
got to only deal with the pure stuff you

98
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:19,750
got to write flawless projects

99
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,530
code conventions unit tests

100
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,690
documentation get tags get workflow if

101
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,690
you don't have these you have nothing

102
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,450
process process process you gotta write

103
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,620
good code and you have to write it

104
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,600
consistently if you don't you're a joke

105
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,740
no one's going to want to use your

106
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,910
projects they're not going to work

107
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,710
they're going to have bad documentation

108
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,910
the unit tests are going to be

109
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,850
non-existent you have to write flawless

110
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,500
projects a strong word call consignment

111
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,120
strictly for live men and not for

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,610
freshmen not everybody got the hook up

113
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,710
for that pure product not everybody got

114
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,090
the hook-up you know I'm saying you

115
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,740
don't got the connection you contribute

116
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,050
to other products other projects still

117
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,020
be gangster the point is is that not

118
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,550
everyone can say on their first day you

119
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,200
know i'm going to write the best project

120
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,880
ever and i'm going to write flawless

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,070
code and my method is unstoppable and my

122
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,710
unit tests could cause an earthquake who

123
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,660
knows and it's like it's just you need

124
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,940
to find someone else's project and you

125
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,380
need to be able to contribute to it and

126
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,400
you need to be able to kind of learn

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,950
what they're doing and get into it still

128
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,410
be gangster you got to get users hooked

129
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,270
you make your projects easy to use you

130
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,040
make the api's accessible you solve the

131
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,169
right problems if you make your products

132
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:33,669
easy to use people want to come back

133
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,680
they got that good good project I got

134
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,020
that good product they want it it's easy

135
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,610
they're used to it it ain't hard to find

136
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,810
me you have to be accessible this is

137
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,640
something I see all the time people will

138
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,380
put something really good out there and

139
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,700
like someone will ask a really basic

140
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,410
question that's pretty reasonable and

141
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,790
like you won't see a response for weeks

142
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,320
if you're going to be slangin your

143
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,550
product and you're going to be putting

144
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,990
your project out there and you're going

145
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,850
to be putting your code out there you

146
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,169
need to be accessible people are going

147
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:03,669
to have questions you need to be able to

148
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,380
listen to their input you need to be

149
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,450
able to take their input and regurgitate

150
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,100
it and put it back into your project you

151
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,810
got treat your clientele well because

152
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,439
they will come back for more product

153
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,879
you got provide good support being

154
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,159
available is good you can say oh hey I

155
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,569
got your message but you really need to

156
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,330
help if someone has a problem like you

157
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,009
might think that they opened up a bad

158
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,689
pull request or maybe they opened up a

159
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,610
stupid issue or maybe oh they didn't

160
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,680
read my documentation that's a

161
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,539
reflection on your project not on the

162
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:37,889
person if you haven't made something

163
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,330
easy enough and you're not able to

164
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,039
provide good enough support you have a

165
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,439
problem you need to fix that you need to

166
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,330
be proactive you need to treat your

167
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,370
users well if people are using your

168
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,680
project it's your prerogative to help

169
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,819
them if you don't your projects nothing

170
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:57,120
you gotta slam your product evangelizing

171
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,339
your code this is something I see all

172
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,529
the time brilliant people write these

173
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,599
beautiful projects they put them up put

174
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,860
them up on github and they don't tell

175
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,210
anybody and they just sit there and

176
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,919
maybe you'll like stumble upon it or

177
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,569
maybe you'll find some random person who

178
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,639
has 10 of the best projects ever but

179
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,830
nobody knows about it you need to put

180
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,089
your code out there you need to be able

181
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,740
to tell people how to find it you need

182
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,259
to be able to evangelize it but

183
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,659
unfortunately when you start putting

184
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:25,610
yourself out there haters gonna hate

185
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,379
yeah you got to ignore distractions

186
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:33,330
people are haters ama hater you're hater

187
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,589
everyone's a hater it's just life some

188
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,330
people are going to give you criticisms

189
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,860
that are useful some people are going to

190
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,110
give you criticisms that are pointless

191
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,360
you need to be able to just ignore the

192
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,399
distractions if there's good information

193
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,110
coming in you need to filter it out but

194
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,550
for the most part if someone's Hayden

195
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,930
and when your eventual eyes and just

196
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,229
ignore them you gotta keep it gangster

197
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:00,180
now how do you keep it gangster you slay

198
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,639
your enemies through github we accept

199
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,839
pull requests we accept pull request if

200
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,849
there's a problem with my project and

201
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:10,589
you tell me about it I'm gonna fix it

202
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,360
and if I don't know how to fix it I'm

203
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,729
gonna be like what's going on give me a

204
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,949
pull request I will accept it it's about

205
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,259
quality it's about improving it's about

206
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,539
moving forward if someone is hating on

207
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:22,949
your project and they're being a hater

208
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,169
you got to keep it gangster and you got

209
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:26,459
to slime them and you got to slam

210
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,560
through github you put the good coat on

211
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,460
there and you get pull requests

212
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:38,090
real recognize real recruitment if you

213
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,470
follow all these steps you have the

214
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,060
workflow you have your projects out

215
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,770
there you have good projects you're

216
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,540
providing good support other people are

217
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,250
going to recognize this real recognize

218
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,380
real you'll see through the

219
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,000
they'll understand that you're doing

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,350
something that you have a good project

221
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,420
and they'll kind of come together and

222
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,500
now you're going to have a whole bunch

223
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,450
of developers all following the same

224
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,980
mentality working on these great

225
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,290
projects providing great support taking

226
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,910
it as much input as they can to just

227
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,960
improve quality and then once this

228
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,070
happens now you got a bunch of

229
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,540
developers with you you got to put the

230
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,720
hood on your back what does that mean

231
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,760
community building you need to reach out

232
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,950
you need to do meetups you need to go to

233
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,870
conferences you need to post to mailing

234
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,610
list you need to do demonstrations you

235
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,430
need to do blog post you need to post it

236
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,530
to the social bookmarking sites which I

237
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,000
will not name and the point is is that

238
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,010
you're not just evangelizing for

239
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,570
yourself anymore you're evangelizing for

240
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,220
your users the people using your

241
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,120
projects and using your product now need

242
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,470
to have the community built up around

243
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,220
them so that they're not alone so that

244
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,170
you get seeds growing everywhere of

245
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,400
these great codons great projects and

246
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,630
then finally you got to put the crew on

247
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,150
the payroll and this is building an

248
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,610
open-source company so at note jitsu i

249
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,380
would estimate eighty to eighty-five

250
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,330
percent of our code bases open source

251
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,210
and on github right now we're an oj s

252
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,440
hosting company it's a very competitive

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,170
field and it's difficult to decision to

254
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,220
do this but it's the right decision

255
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,390
because the quality code will stand out

256
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,930
and finally you got to keep it real now

257
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,850
I can't really tell you how to keep it

258
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,550
real it's not really something that you

259
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,090
learn it's just something that you do so

260
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,290
I'm going to try to do the realest thing

261
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,080
again which is just release a project

262
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,610
live right now and it's not just any

263
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,820
project it's a pretty disruptive lon so

264
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,630
to give a little background in je s com

265
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,070
2010 I announced the hook

266
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,090
project hook io is a full-featured io

267
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,520
framework for no Jas since the release

268
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,650
it's got over 700 Watchers on github

269
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,530
there's over 18 hooks for the

270
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,480
application hosted here there's probably

271
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,520
another 15 floating around there's 10

272
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,030
active contributors it's a big project

273
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,230
to give it a little idea of how it works

274
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,590
we can look at this blog post made by

275
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:12,660
pair there is thank you so just to give

276
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,610
you a quick idea of what hook I 0 is 0

277
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,090
chi 0 is a way of distributing your i/o

278
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,710
and an application in a traditional

279
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,300
application you might have your web

280
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,310
you're logging your IRC your email all

281
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,720
this logic is coupled together in the

282
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,360
same process this is bad it's not so

283
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,100
smart if you have a problem in one of

284
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,330
these pieces is going to take the whole

285
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,080
app stack down ko kayo allows you to

286
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,940
distribute this among multiple processes

287
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,270
this is really cool but what I came to

288
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,130
realize is that people build web

289
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,260
applications and they want real-time web

290
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,860
applications so we'll go here so what

291
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,800
I've got is hook j/s this is hook io

292
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,350
brought to the browser so real quickly

293
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:02,370
we'll just do this

294
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,420
make it public boom so now this is live

295
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:18,370
I don't know if you can notice it's been

296
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,410
a very great conference great great

297
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,700
parties very late parties so yes poop

298
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,580
dot Jaso okay what exactly did I just

299
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,990
release oh yeah okay brought hook I owe

300
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,210
to the browser excellent so it's great

301
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,440
that we have all these distributed

302
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,850
events but now what we have is the

303
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,160
ability to actually do this in a web

304
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,110
browser so let's just get it started and

305
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,770
do a live demo so first I will start up

306
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,590
see if we can see this cool oh that's

307
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,150
the rainbow repple you can't see it yet

308
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,190
okay so we're going to start our top

309
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,900
level hook this is going to be the the

310
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,430
master hook at the top of the stack

311
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,170
which will be the repple and we're just

312
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,370
going to do this so that we can kind of

313
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,690
look at the messages as they come

314
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,430
through and then in addition to that

315
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:06,070
we're going to start hook jas will go to

316
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,510
our browser window and load up the

317
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,030
interface for hope Jas it's very basic

318
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,030
we just did this in the past few days so

319
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,680
the way that this works is now you have

320
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,100
this magic variable called hook I'll

321
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,400
back it up a step you require hook j/s

322
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,460
in any page this file can be local or it

323
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,110
could be remotely hosted and then you

324
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,210
have access to the hook object the hook

325
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,920
object allows you to have this

326
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,170
distributed event emitter where you can

327
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,990
just omit events on the browser and on

328
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,350
the server you can get them in addition

329
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,300
to this you can omit the opposite way

330
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,940
and you can also do a callback API so

331
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,270
from the browser you can emit an event

332
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:52,210
with a call back on the server it will

333
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,000
accept the event and then it will

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,130
process it so if we call hook damn it in

335
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,200
the browser it'll outputs up since the

336
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,330
server responds back so we can actually

337
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,770
do a lot demo of this right now so we'll

338
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,800
got this one open here and we'll open up

339
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:17,810
this one here cool so just to give you

340
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,240
an idea in Firefox we're going to do

341
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,920
hooked on browser sup and we'll do that

342
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,740
binding and then over here will do hook

343
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,950
dot emit sup dawg so this is going to

344
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,579
omit the sup event with the data dog

345
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:35,570
will hit that and then if we go back to

346
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,970
the other browser session oh not run

347
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:47,870
that awesome oh there it is cool I

348
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,350
thought it didn't work so as you can see

349
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,850
the the message has gone through now

350
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,260
this is a pretty trivial example we're

351
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,880
just doing basic message passing between

352
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,579
browsers but what the important thing to

353
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,170
understand here is ho gaya was a full

354
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,149
featured event framework I offering work

355
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:04,519
rather for node so we have a whole

356
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,140
series of these hooks that have

357
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,209
independent functionality for things

358
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,420
like simple as making a HTTP request and

359
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,209
as complicated as consuming the data

360
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:18,070
from the Bitcoin exchange mtgo X we had

361
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,420
18 or so officially sponsored in

362
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,550
probably another 15 floating around so

363
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,550
being able to do this distributed event

364
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,770
emitter across the browser is kind of

365
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,020
cool you know we have D node which is

366
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,709
this is built on and but you need to

367
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,480
take a step farther because when you

368
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,560
send these events like what are you

369
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,029
really doing at the end of the day

370
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:39,230
you're probably going to be delegating

371
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,339
it back and you're probably gonna be

372
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,560
saying oh well I'm going to say so the

373
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,149
send email event and then somewhere in

374
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:45,320
your controller logic you're probably

375
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,240
going to parse that out and hook I oh

376
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,959
just makes this way simpler so to give

377
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:56,870
an example we could actually I'm not

378
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,399
going to try to connect to the IRC here

379
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,110
but just to show you on the repple we

380
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,990
could capture any of these events so as

381
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,250
we've been firing these events the

382
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,630
repple has been running and it's just

383
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,010
keeping a log of everything that goes

384
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,930
through so it would be trivial for us to

385
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,579
just catch any event and to remit it

386
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:14,959
into the hook io cloud in addition to

387
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,339
just having this distributed event

388
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:17,779
emitter thing in the browser now it's

389
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,130
it's actually doing a bunch of stuff

390
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,860
this is um I don't know if it's coming

391
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,300
across well or not but this is

392
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,750
very disruptive this is providing a pub

393
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,180
sub that anyone can just deploy anywhere

394
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,010
anonymously and they just connect to it

395
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,740
if I provide a unique hash up here

396
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,480
that's going to subscribe it now to this

397
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,100
channel and the only way to enumerate

398
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,540
the events from there is if you know the

399
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,279
name and this is all open source you can

400
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,839
deploy this right now it just released

401
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,089
it in addition to just having this pub

402
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:45,800
sub that anyone can subscribe to it also

403
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,959
launches up to other hooks one of which

404
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:51,560
is the web hook which is on port 9001

405
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,950
what this allows here we go is for you

406
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,230
to post arbitrary HTTP requests such as

407
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,040
a JSON RPC so you have this endpoint

408
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,959
that's not WebSocket based and not

409
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,550
socket i/o base so if you need someone

410
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,890
to broadcast the message into your hook

411
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,220
io cloud or into your hook j/s rather

412
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,230
they can just hit it with a HTTP request

413
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,569
here and then it'll pipe through and in

414
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,250
addition to that it also spawns up a

415
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,010
feed so if you're not using a web socket

416
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,420
interface and you want to subscribe to

417
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,559
the events from this hook you can also

418
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:24,439
listen to the feed so the idea with this

419
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,699
is that you could essentially just

420
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:28,730
deploy this little pub sub sano jitsu or

421
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,740
a similar hosting company and then you

422
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,360
could just start subscribing to messages

423
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,640
just pumping stuff back and forth and

424
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,380
that you're hooked into hook i oh so you

425
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,270
have full access to the entire book

426
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,630
library so this is kind of like I

427
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,980
consider this the next step in

428
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,900
distributed our pcs and the next step in

429
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,390
pops up and I think a lot of people are

430
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,500
going to be really worried about this

431
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,800
yeah so I think that's pretty much it

432
00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:08,960
same what have any questions

433
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,350
so the first question is how does it

434
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,460
scale yes what was the second question

435
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,120
what is the web the protocol so it

436
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,700
actually right now the Elm the idea is

437
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,129
to become an enterprise service bus so

438
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:29,559
the current protocol is denote protocol

439
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,919
so if we go to sub stack denote protocol

440
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,679
so it's just a on it's a JSON RPC so if

441
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:40,480
you're familiar with Dino Dino tis a way

442
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,570
to communicate between nodes and between

443
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,519
browser and node and nodejs and it also

444
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,500
gives you a really neat way of calling

445
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,389
our mi doing the remote method

446
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:50,919
invocation without serializing the

447
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:53,110
function so to give you an idea it kind

448
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,769
of looks like this but what's

449
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,299
interesting is that we're working on

450
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:00,220
making it multi transport and making it

451
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,620
not coupled to denote so we already have

452
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,480
the couchdb transport in place so you

453
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,370
can actually use CouchDB as the message

454
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,429
bus instead of using node and we're like

455
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:13,169
yeah so right now it's denote protocol

456
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:17,500
yes it scales if you're going to ask an

457
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,909
open-ended question there's only so much

458
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:23,230
I can say like what do you mean say

459
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:32,440
again multiple instances of the oh so I

460
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,389
mean it's still an open it in question

461
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:35,919
like which piece do you need to scale

462
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,929
what part of the i/o is important to you

463
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,039
are you talking about concurrent

464
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,720
requests your web server are you talking

465
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,120
about making a spider that's spidering a

466
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,649
thousand different sites are you talking

467
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:45,669
about something that has a lot of

468
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:47,230
database access are you talking about

469
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,669
something that's communicating with 10

470
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:50,860
different web services like there's no

471
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,450
magic bullet to scaling hook I hope

472
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,610
provides you a framework for being able

473
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,169
to implement all these different load

474
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:57,789
balancing strategies so it's not really

475
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm not tying you into anything it's

476
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,070
very open right now and before we

477
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,740
release we're in the 0.7 X branch right

478
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,480
now and before we release one point oh

479
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,429
we're going to include a bunch of load

480
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,110
balancing strategies most available

481
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,039
around Robin etc etc it's scaling is no

482
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,520
magic bullet

483
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:30,549
anybody else yes um yeah there's a bunch

484
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:33,820
of them I could check one right now yeah

485
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,980
why not maybe it won't load so this yeah

486
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,230
it's gonna take a little bit to load so

487
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,970
we've built a few things on it this is

488
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,610
station this is a third-party monitoring

489
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,880
service for no Jitsu so the way that

490
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,010
this works is that internally we have a

491
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,230
lot of we have agents on every machine

492
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,870
similar to nagios so we have them

493
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,610
reporting to our central server and

494
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,140
internally we're tracking a lot of stuff

495
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,179
now this is cool but I don't trust

496
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:03,390
anybody's code by my own so this is a

497
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,799
redundant monitoring system so what this

498
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,390
is doing is this is a combination of

499
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,270
seven different hook io hooks including

500
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,070
the hook Jas what you've just seen which

501
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,340
is the web server it's using twilio it's

502
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,220
using request it's using cron it's using

503
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,409
web hook so if a site goes down it's

504
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:22,240
going to flash offline and then everyone

505
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,890
on the team is going to get an SMS every

506
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,380
one of the team's going to get an email

507
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,659
yes this is one example application and

508
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:35,010
that latency seems a little off
