1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,040

yeah thank you very much

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,750
I'd like to start with a kind of

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,020
question because as I said I didn't

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,910
really prepare something and this would

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,160
be a live coding session and so I'd like

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,439
to know why what you're interested in

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,430
and I show you two projects of mine who

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,110
we can write tests for right now and one

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,470
is a note project is that that's a

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,360
helper for writing better commit

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,140
messages you see I sneak in some parts

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,050
of my part of my talk that has been

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,090
rejected I show you how that works so I

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:01:00,080
have a project here that's and add some

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,180
community it's big enough can you read

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,990
this ok I for the whole talk if you have

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,960
anything any ideas anything how to make

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,630
the think better if I should talk slower

19
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,409
or you just want to say something or see

20
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,860
an arrow i do just yell at me and feel

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,060
free to interrupt that would be nice so

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:31,670
I add the package Jason here and there's

23
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,120
a tool called committed sin and I can

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:44,210
say get it set and now here is proposing

25
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,130
types for for this commit so the package

26
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,190
Jason will probably show commit and

27
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,780
that's on the package and now i can

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,860
write something here I don't yeah I

29
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,020
don't know basically the note package is

30
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,940
a small tool that can help that's part

31
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,489
of this chain to write better commit

32
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:14,480
messages so in depth that's untested

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,209
right now and we could write notes unit

34
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:21,730
tests for that too the other thing is i

35
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,950
work at gym no

36
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:34,180
and we do have this UI library it looks

37
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,080
like this it's basically a long list of

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,420
how i can scroll somehow so a long list

39
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,769
of patterns that we can use in our you

40
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:50,890
is and I don't know if there's that's

41
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,410
not really a use case but a lack of a

42
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,140
better project to chest we could write

43
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,650
some entry and chest for this library so

44
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,040
basically we can switch from production

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:11,019
to better state and see marcos for

46
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,290
example and yeah we can basically use

47
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,079
selenium to click on that and Maggie

48
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,950
make some screenshots so that these are

49
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,400
the two projects i propose and now by a

50
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,280
sign of hand who would like to see you

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,760
know chest 44 no project okay and enter

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,440
and test for for another okay we do nain

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:52,180
test i can close this

54
00:03:52,190 --> 00:04:03,830
I reset this commit so i won't go into

55
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,350
the details of setting up this stuff

56
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,270
because i use not that fancy new

57
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,720
technology i will use Night Watch which

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,860
is kind of a yeah and then not a hipster

59
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,520
just new project that came up but some

60
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:29,560
some good software that in my opinion is

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,010
stable and I won't be really opinionated

62
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,070
about what to use for for that stuff but

63
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,060
instead I'd like to show you the

64
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,740
concepts that I think you can apply on

65
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,250
other frameworks like protractor or some

66
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,710
new newer stuff so I worked a lot with

67
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,770
projector for angular halves and s you

68
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,780
might hurt all angular apps are now

69
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,070
dying and we skip to react and stuff so

70
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:09,890
a protractor is not that really think so

71
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:16,710
let's go to Night Watch

72
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,960
I prepared what i did is i installed

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,130
Night Watch npm install Night Watch you

74
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,490
can get it and installed a selenium

75
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:34,050
helper that is called webdriver manager

76
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,710
and that can help me to set up a

77
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:49,690
selenium server locally here we go

78
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,480
selenium service up and running so what

79
00:05:52,480 --> 00:06:02,150
we now can do is start the demo app I

80
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,090
think I killed the summer so yeah that

81
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:21,839
might take a little while and then

82
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:35,760
Night Watch is testing something

83
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,840
I'm not really sure but because the

84
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,900
screen is so small maybe we can we will

85
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,849
run into issues because of that but we

86
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:51,039
will see no actually okay my first chest

87
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,319
I prepared is passing so everything is

88
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,000
fine here's what I did we have a Night

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,259
Watch Jason oh that's a wrong project

90
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:07,870
one moment we take this one he's a Night

91
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,229
Watch Jason basically this is just cargo

92
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,630
coding from the Night Watch home page

93
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,639
interesting is that we connect to a

94
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,780
selenium here so we started a selenium

95
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,650
server and that's running on my local

96
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:35,800
machine here on port 44 44 and here

97
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,990
we're saying Night Watch to connect to

98
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,449
you this that could be also some cloud

99
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,669
service like sauce labs or browser stack

100
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,750
or something anything that can that

101
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,610
provides a selenium API and we are

102
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,620
saying hey we want to use a chrome and

103
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,960
the rest of this fire is pretty much

104
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,060
just cargo coding setup here's my first

105
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,159
test so basically what we're doing is

106
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,590
we're assigning the browser to weigh

107
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,699
more than you know can show us so every

108
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:21,219
600 to 800 800 600

109
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:24,389
then we want to test something so let's

110
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:33,209
test the production check what we first

111
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:36,149
need to do we tell the client to go on

112
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,089
this website so that's exactly the one

113
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,729
that I showed you here running on my

114
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,620
local machine could be anywhere I could

115
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,910
run this test against a production side

116
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,770
icon could run it against Google or

117
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:55,770
whatever and then I'm just asserting

118
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,209
that there is an element with this CSS

119
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:04,250
selector on the page it's a UI check

120
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,339
that's active and I want to ensure that

121
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,920
this is production so basically this

122
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,940
would be a chest to ensure that we see

123
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,250
this state when we land on this page it

124
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,870
could be that some person things that

125
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,579
would good would be good to it we have

126
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:29,339
the beta enabled by default and then

127
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,120
this check this chest would fail so if

128
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,500
we say we would like to have the beta

129
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,820
enabled by default and run the test

130
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:47,220
again I can watch it here yeah and now

131
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,990
it says hey the element was this

132
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,670
selector contains the text beta that was

133
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,149
our assertion but we got production so

134
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:09,870
something is wrong

135
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,950
it will but we actually want to have it

136
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,360
to be production and now let's change

137
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,230
that lets say hey what happens if we do

138
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,340
this we land on the page we click this

139
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,320
button and then we click this button now

140
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,050
we want to have one to ensure that the

141
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:36,410
beta button as a active it's simple as

142
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:49,100
that we say click here now we should

143
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,120
have a state where where there is no

144
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,380
active check and then we click on the

145
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:03,340
other

146
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,420
check when I'm searching for a selector

147
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,580
that we can actually click on you I take

148
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:26,269
better looks promising

149
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:34,110
and now we assert that this is Vita and

150
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,240
in case you wonder I have a palace here

151
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,300
just to have a chance to see the stage

152
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,499
before the browser quits if we would run

153
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:47,730
that in CI or some headless draw that is

154
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,610
pretty much useless so we can skip that

155
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,040
but right now it's kind of interesting

156
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,839
to see the state that we are after

157
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,410
having menu eadha manually clicked not

158
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:12,089
manually click I rerun this and that

159
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:16,579
word so these are our two assertions

160
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:18,959
then we have production better and

161
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,350
everything is fine I think you get the

162
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,490
idea you can basically go crazy with

163
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:34,769
this and we could yeah normally on the

164
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:36,300
left side here would be a navigation we

165
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,430
could check if the navigation works so

166
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,920
we see the exact pattern that we

167
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,519
navigated to we can check the context

168
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,250
switch that we have here but i think

169
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,809
that would be repetitive so let's dig a

170
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,750
little bit into a regression visual

171
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,649
regression stuff what we just recently

172
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:02,670
did is to use exactly this tool to do

173
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,309
then screenshots of this page so what we

174
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:13,679
can do is say hey please screen shot

175
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:21,149
here and i think i have to it's safe

176
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:30,259
screenshot and i have to say beta

177
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,160
something like that I don't actually

178
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:42,800
know if this works that's chick

179
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:49,480
you

180
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:55,020
doesn't look like it and so them oh here

181
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:06,680
it is nice we have a screenshot so and

182
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,900
we could now take this screenshot and

183
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,880
run some image analysis against it and

184
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,070
compared with another to ensure that we

185
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,160
made made few years ago and say hey we

186
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,070
want to have want to ensure that there's

187
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,860
no difference between this and that

188
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,710
there are tools that do all that out of

189
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,250
the box like phantom CSS and webdriver

190
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,780
io problem is right now I feel that both

191
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,440
of these projects are kind of not that

192
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,320
stable State so that's why we used Night

193
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,010
Watch but i highly recommend to to check

194
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,220
for pro for projects that do all that

195
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,280
out of the box before you try to to make

196
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,360
come up with some solution for your own

197
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:11,640
m so what's the time that was just a 50

198
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:29,490
minutes ok what we do now any ideas

199
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,430
that's a really good question I kind of

200
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,660
hope that we just came into a situation

201
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,420
where that happened and then I forgot

202
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,060
about that thing so there are a

203
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,950
synchronous things so maybe the web page

204
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,290
will load some scripts after user

205
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,260
clicked on a specific pattern or maybe

206
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,570
you have a really big JavaScript app

207
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,820
that just takes some time to calculate a

208
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,560
state or whatever one thing I really

209
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,080
loved about protector is that protractor

210
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,500
can hook into angular and kind of asks

211
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,360
angular if there is a state that that is

212
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,170
stable so you can if you know a little

213
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,880
bit of the insides of angular angular

214
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,370
has this digest loops so basically

215
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,590
whenever I click on a button angular

216
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,160
just runs and waits for state where

217
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,980
there's no change and with protractor

218
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,500
these angular can tell hey I have a

219
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,420
state where where I don't expect any

220
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,960
changes and now you can make assertions

221
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,960
um so and basically if you happen to

222
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,850
work on an angular app i highly

223
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,740
recommend to use project over because

224
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,440
you normally don't need to think about

225
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,730
that but let's just assume we are not a

226
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,940
name on an angular app and we have some

227
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,699
asynchronous stuff here so as you see

228
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,620
when I read out that page maybe can

229
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:20,960
throttle that a bit

230
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,829
there's this loading screen and if I

231
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,750
happen to make assertions by this

232
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,350
loading screen is active normally what

233
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,640
what selenium will say hey and this

234
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,200
button that you try to click on it's not

235
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,559
visible to me right now so right now if

236
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,789
I click here nothing will happen because

237
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:49,850
the button is not there and therefore

238
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,620
mostly all so there's not not a nice

239
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,059
what Night Watch specific thing most

240
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,840
yeah most implementations for selenium

241
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:13,169
do have such things I'm it's a wait for

242
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:23,250
state so I could say hey um I know that

243
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,230
when I go to this URL there's some kind

244
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,320
of loading overlay or some asynchronous

245
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,519
stuff and I could say hey let's wait

246
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,429
until this loading overlay is not

247
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,559
present I'm not visible would be another

248
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,309
thing so the the difference between

249
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:48,279
presence and visibility is basically an

250
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,620
element could be on the page so the dumb

251
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,419
notice on the page but it's on this

252
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:55,929
plane on or hidden between after another

253
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:58,450
element or something and in that case it

254
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,909
wouldn't be visible and if that dumb

255
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:03,760
mode simply doesn't exist it isn't

256
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,110
present so let's try to figure out how

257
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:22,220
that loading overlay

258
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,029
if I just had watched the war and the

259
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:49,680
talk about service workers yesterday

260
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,230
it's just this loading class on the body

261
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:58,950
so there was actually this one that was

262
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:21,520
correct let's check if that works nope

263
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,300
so he expected a second parameter on

264
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:45,280
that I think it's a timeout

265
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,930
okay yeah and that's not actually what

266
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,560
we wanted but it's traits the the issue

267
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,380
here because now we're getting an error

268
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,770
that we timed out while waiting for the

269
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:04,760
element loading to be present and we

270
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,240
expected it to become not visible but it

271
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:15,860
wasn't actually found so we need to

272
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,240
ensure that this element where the

273
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,130
selector loading is not present after we

274
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,020
go to this website and wait for five

275
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:37,760
seconds for at most five seconds okay

276
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,990
here we go element loading was not

277
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,110
present after 33 milliseconds and then

278
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:54,130
all the rest of our sessions were okay

279
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,430
that's a bit tricky because yes you can

280
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:05,070
do that but maybe if you any made an

281
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:10,380
element in the view and you say hey wait

282
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,660
for this element to be to become visible

283
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,360
it will be visible when it just enters

284
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,520
the view a little bit so I know how

285
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,520
angular is solving that and I don't know

286
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,560
if I assume that other animation

287
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,570
frameworks have another approach so I

288
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,970
think if you have I guess jquery can do

289
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,540
that too that you just manually inject

290
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,600
the JavaScript into the page that sets

291
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,840
all animations 20 so it just happened

292
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,140
instantaneously that's the magic one of

293
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,210
the testing magic behind angular animate

294
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,010
and I think other animation framework

295
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,380
can support something simular so the

296
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,660
ideas that you just disable animations

297
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,750
for inch and tests and what I just did

298
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,560
in a case where I wasn't able to do that

299
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,950
is work with palaces but that's not

300
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,090
elegant so we checked what is the

301
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,890
longest animation that we can expect and

302
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,140
then when there was a state that we know

303
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,390
here an animation is happening here we

304
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,700
just waited for 500 milliseconds but I

305
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,160
see that this is not a good nada not an

306
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,050
elegant solution but it works for all in

307
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:33,039
our case so

308
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:37,019
no sorry the question was if I had

309
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:40,970
problems with scroll events not really

310
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,370
ran into problems why not try to scroll

311
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:49,129
in phantom ge'ez because that kind of

312
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:53,309
don't support scroll events but I

313
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:56,549
haven't dicked into that so we just

314
00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:00,539
didn't use phantom j/s then I think it

315
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,909
would be possible somehow that we used

316
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:07,259
native products or Firefox and Chrome

317
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,259
for most parts and there the scrolling

318
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:13,590
was we had no problems did you have any

319
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:24,799
problems concretely or okay

320
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:29,220
okay so the problem was with phantom Jas

321
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,889
yeah I can relate to that but I haven't

322
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:35,269
I don't have a good solution for that

323
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:37,379
should we just continue with some

324
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:41,460
questions or should any thing in that

325
00:24:41,460 --> 00:25:02,769
you want to see or I can show you the

326
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:07,619
the visual regression stuff we did but

327
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,259
as a disclaimer we didn't actually test

328
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,419
it so right now that's just a tool that

329
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:16,529
produces screenshots and we are in the

330
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:19,080
process of using that screenshots to to

331
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,999
actually test that against in other

332
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,309
states so basically it's just what you

333
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:26,669
just saw we are going on a page like

334
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:30,899
this and clicking around two to produce

335
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:33,179
a state that we want to test and then we

336
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,490
make a screenshot of that and the next

337
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,769
step would offer used to be be to have

338
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:41,279
some kind of image dipping 20 to say hey

339
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,929
we have a change and we don't have a

340
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:47,909
change and the big question that is most

341
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:49,679
of the parts not really solved in my

342
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,019
opinion is how to say how to to come up

343
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,369
with a state that we want to test

344
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:00,389
against with so it's kind of easy to

345
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:03,720
make a screenshot of a page but how do

346
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,090
what's the state that we compared

347
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:12,600
against so well if this runs on a Cir I

348
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,460
have a pull request test that makes

349
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,889
automated three shots what is the state

350
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:19,379
that we want to achieve here I do a pull

351
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:20,610
request because I want to change

352
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,869
something and when the two were just

353
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:28,640
said maybe it fails because it's

354
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,340
hey the button that you just changed its

355
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,960
now no red instead of green maybe that's

356
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,140
exactly what I wanted to have so the big

357
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,830
question is how how do do we create the

358
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:58,200
input for the test so what's this date

359
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,590
so when we are in a great point with

360
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:10,100
lesson two young two of them the contest

361
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,280
no sorry

362
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:19,030
this

363
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:26,150
okay so what was it anyway Galen yeah so

364
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,460
there was just a comment about the Galen

365
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,490
framework and I haven't had it looked at

366
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,880
it but that what maybe that maybe in

367
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,130
framework to solve exactly the issue

368
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,920
that I just said and I have ideas on

369
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,290
that and would like to talk about that

370
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,010
but these are not in this presentable
