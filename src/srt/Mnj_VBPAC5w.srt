1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,189

so hello everyone

2
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:13,200
Theodore engineer in an applicant

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,570
tracking system called workable you can

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,310
find me online with under the nickname

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,699
wordless and I flew my way here from

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,800
Athens Greece actually the verse from

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,840
the very same neighborhood the current

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,910
aim and being the people air Jensen

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,570
takubo was born and raised so today I'm

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,369
super excited to be with you because I

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,079
have the chance to talk to you about one

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,059
of the most interesting projects that I

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,190
have ever had the chance to work with so

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,660
today we're gonna talk about how

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,110
JavaScript and accessibility can can be

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,270
used in real-life situations

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,160
before we start though it's really

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,039
important to take a step back and take a

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,989
look her community has evolved over the

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,510
past few years we are extremely

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,760
extremely blessed to have so many great

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,859
people among us

23
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,320
people that have actually broaden our

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,070
aspects and our vision so we can talk

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,260
beyond code so we can talk about human

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,180
rights about inclusivity and more often

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,990
about accessibility so what's

28
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,659
accessibility all about if we take a

29
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,009
look at the dictionary term of

30
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,869
accessibility we will find out that

31
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,420
accessibility fair or refers to all

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,329
these actions we have to take in order

33
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,909
to create products environments or

34
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,000
systems accessible to everyone as far as

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,430
we concerned those software engineers

36
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,070
web developers web designers we are

37
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,770
mostly focused into creating accessible

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,409
communication systems like we want to

39
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,140
communicate with our end-users so we are

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,600
using semantic hTML we are integrating

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,030
external software like screen readers or

42
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,060
external hardware you will be very

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,430
surprised though if I tell you that the

44
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,320
very first accessible communication

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,590
system was introduced nearly 200 years

46
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,810
ago so this is loose bright bright was

47
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,400
born and raised in a small city outside

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,170
of Paris in the early nineteen

49
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,060
chewing and as a child he suffered a

50
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,500
terrible accident that left him

51
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,470
completely blind from both his eyes but

52
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,739
still he has managed to excel his

53
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,260
education and finally got accepted at

54
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,420
the national institution for blind youth

55
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,970
in Paris it was back then where she

56
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,380
found out that the reading and writing

57
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,270
system used by visually impaired people

58
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,670
back in the days were how can I say bit

59
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,030
absurd so people who are using brush

60
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,580
strokes trying to create and boast

61
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,220
letters trying to recreate the alphabet

62
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,720
used by the sighted people

63
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,760
so at the age of 15 yeah 15 she created

64
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,480
the famous brag system brag is a tactile

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,940
system it actually it's actually the

66
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,819
very first binary encoding system ever

67
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,890
made so we can actually say that Bragg

68
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,280
was the great-grandfather of computer

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,860
science right so usually bright comes in

70
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,980
to a shape of six positions and the

71
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,069
system encodes characters letters or

72
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,079
symbols using combinations of raised

73
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,260
dots and spaces in its very first form a

74
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,959
sly a slate and stylus were used in

75
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,859
order to allow people to write and brag

76
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:30,720
so the readers can use their fingers

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,320
their fingertips trace down the letters

78
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,090
combine them creating words sentences

79
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,570
and so on brag system quotes good it was

80
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,430
actually so good that hasn't literally

81
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,280
changed since its birth as we speak brag

82
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,500
is translated more than 200 languages

83
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,859
and has found applications from math to

84
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:55,650
music composition and so on okay

85
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,239
so soon after Bragg's death typographers

86
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,459
used heavy weight paper and make endless

87
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,510
type sets and books and brags get start

88
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,750
getting out in public

89
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,959
soon after in the early 20th century

90
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,180
typewriters were invited so modified rag

91
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,220
typewriters allowed the gives provided

92
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,229
the users with a semi-automatic way of

93
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:22,229
writing break by the way the happy

94
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,640
typing lady you can see in the video

95
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,620
this is

96
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,010
Keller Helen Keller was a famous

97
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,190
American author and activist about human

98
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,990
rights for people with disabilities and

99
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,720
also the very first blind deaf person

100
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,229
that has managed to graduate college

101
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:41,120
Buckner's third line the last person in

102
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,760
our puzzle was introduced in the late

103
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,540
1990s 1919 so this retro-looking devices

104
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,970
are called a refreshable blog this place

105
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,000
as you can see in the bottom the bottom

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,669
device there like a fixed set of bragg

107
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,740
cells brake artists are also known as

108
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,380
bright cells so the users can load text

109
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,030
or they can pair these devices with

110
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,389
external hardware like laptops or mobile

111
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:12,979
phones so let's recap the year is 2019

112
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,750
organizations and individuals

113
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,139
individuals are raising concerns about

114
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:20,630
literacy rates over around the globe we

115
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,850
have the tools we have the assets we

116
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,490
have the mindset we have this system

117
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,470
that actually works for so long

118
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,410
so someone could say that we're good in

119
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,770
a really good shape right well actually

120
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,650
wrong numbers and statistics ours are

121
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,919
heartbreaking I called according to the

122
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,870
world World Health Organization 2253

123
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,150
million people are living with visual

124
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,669
impairment all around the globe most of

125
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,270
them are suffering poetry or living

126
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,710
within war zones only 10% of these

127
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,570
people can have access to be appropriate

128
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,820
education material or even a chance to

129
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,099
get a job and someone could say that

130
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:10,160
cannot relate with within these numbers

131
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,780
right so we're talking about developing

132
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,030
countries or I don't know people living

133
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,360
in Syria or Libya right bear with me for

134
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,330
a moment according to the National

135
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,090
Federation of the blind

136
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,030
90% of visually impaired children living

137
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,430
in the state are not capable of reading

138
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,310
and writing because they're not being

139
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,200
taught brag or a given access to a

140
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,650
proper educational material just to give

141
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,650
you a perspective

142
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,960
about how low these numbers are I'm

143
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,360
gonna compare them against the literacy

144
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,419
rate of Ethiopia Ethiopia is a country

145
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,389
that has suffered poetry and civil war

146
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,790
for more than 30 years but still fifty

147
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,090
percent of the citizens of Theo Pia are

148
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,160
capable of reading and writing the most

149
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,410
important fact about these numbers is

150
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,840
the fact that these numbers are

151
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,060
increasing as we speak year by year but

152
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,510
still bright literacy rates for excuse

153
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,050
me

154
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,690
literacy literacy rates for visually

155
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,449
impaired people living in the States are

156
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,530
stuck since the 70s and we have to think

157
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,660
ourselves what did we do so wrong so

158
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,460
what actually causes this disaster as a

159
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,199
matter of fact we're lucky enough we're

160
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,440
lacking of assets so books brilliantly

161
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,930
brag are like super expensive that cost

162
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,580
three to eight times higher than a

163
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,639
regular book and also just 1% of the

164
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,470
available books are also available for

165
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,010
bribe professor will brag this place are

166
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,840
like super expensive they cost five

167
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,280
hundred to eight thousand dollars

168
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,710
depending on the number of the cells

169
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,310
provided and last but not least

170
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,450
typewriters are super expensive as well

171
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,599
and although the typewriting acknowledge

172
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,950
its a bit observing people are still

173
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,530
using them because they're like a more

174
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,360
appropriate way and they provide the

175
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,160
users with a more delicate way of

176
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,360
writing brag and now imagine that

177
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,180
someone hunched give this problem like

178
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,310
he was a member of the JavaScript

179
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,229
community is there anything that we can

180
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,590
do in order to help these people when I

181
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,020
first tried to test myself break I was

182
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,669
stuck with this problem like lot and I

183
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,860
thought think about I keep thinking

184
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,729
about the like a lot so I have decided

185
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:29,849
to trying creating a device advice that

186
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,800
we could actually try to mimic how

187
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,770
refreshable break this place work so I

188
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,650
want to try small maybe starting with a

189
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,680
single bright cell and maybe scaling up

190
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,790
as the person as my prototype could

191
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,610
start taking shape before we start

192
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,200
though have to set up some goals right

193
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,510
so since I had no prior

194
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,970
experience with hardware or embedded

195
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,930
development

196
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,270
I wanted my advice to be as simple as

197
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,880
possible obviously it has to be

198
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,340
accessible to everyone and finally I

199
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,900
want to make my device as simple as

200
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,220
possible but how we start is it even

201
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,990
possible for software engineers like me

202
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,320
to prototype hardware device apparently

203
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,400
piece we're gonna accelerate that our

204
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,320
development process using a piece of

205
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,030
technology called micro controllers so

206
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,310
micro controllers for those that are not

207
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,060
familiar with the subject are like tiny

208
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,260
computational units they're usually

209
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,490
coming into the shape of a board they're

210
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,230
relatively cheap and easy to get our

211
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,410
hands on Arduinos raspberry PI's photon

212
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,440
just name a few so for the purpose of

213
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,340
this experiment I have decided to one to

214
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,980
stick with one of the most famous one

215
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,110
Arduino Uno I purchased mine online from

216
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,170
like a couple bucks as you can see the

217
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,450
board has pins popping out from the

218
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,690
device so labeled with numbers so we can

219
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,850
actually expand the functionality of the

220
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,740
board just by attaching or detaching

221
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,340
external modules sensors and so on so

222
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,140
for the purposes of this experiment I

223
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,230
want to start coding and experimenting I

224
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,030
will try the hello world hello world the

225
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,310
project of hardware development like

226
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,710
flashing an LED light so I have attached

227
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,240
an LED on pin labeled 13 and the ground

228
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,230
just power up the LED but how can we

229
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,290
code a development board so they are

230
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,180
doing a comes with an IDE called the

231
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,720
Arduino IDE obviously and we can use C

232
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,320
code just to write code for the device

233
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,840
assemble piece of code for flattened LED

234
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,550
would look like this so we're

235
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,780
initializing the pin labeled 13th we are

236
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,790
doing of house building functions like

237
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,470
the setup function show we're setting

238
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,680
the the appropriate pin as an output and

239
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,500
it has also a loop function that runs

240
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,840
all the time so we're gonna blast the

241
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,660
LED look high and low using a delay

242
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,320
of 500 milliseconds and that piece of

243
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,710
code actually works but as I was trying

244
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,690
and experimenting with different modules

245
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,090
and I was trying to integrate my device

246
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,440
with maybe a web interface

247
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,360
I found myself stuck just be honest with

248
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,790
you haven't written C since my college

249
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,360
years so it was really hard and luckily

250
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,530
there was stumped up on the project

251
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,970
called John 5

252
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,390
so John fives an ID in a platform

253
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,250
developed by Canadian company called Bo

254
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,230
coop that allows us to write JavaScript

255
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,950
code no Jes code for microcontrollers in

256
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,990
some cases like the raspberry PI's we

257
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,750
can create standalone prototypes in our

258
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,340
case using the Arduino we can actually

259
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,040
remotely johnny-five creates a think

260
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,930
lines so we can actually remotely

261
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,700
control the device from our development

262
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,420
machine and we can actually rewrite the

263
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,730
flashing example the flashing LED

264
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,190
example just like including the

265
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,220
johnny-five module initializing a new

266
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,680
board and using the callback when the

267
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,990
board is ready we're going to flash the

268
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,680
LED using the blink LED the blinking LED

269
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,880
function and I can barely hear some of

270
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,190
you whispering what's wrong with this

271
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,650
with this guy why does he want to write

272
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,240
JavaScript for a freaking

273
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,590
microcontroller okay

274
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,900
when JavaScript was born it was the

275
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,880
implementation was how can say a bit

276
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,850
naive so we will use JavaScript as an

277
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,640
event-driven programming language and

278
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,930
this thing actually works the same

279
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,790
concepts work for microcontrollers

280
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,350
you're gonna integrate external external

281
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,340
components with your device so you're

282
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,530
gonna you have to listen for buttons

283
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,960
clicking or flashing LED and so on and

284
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,850
JavaScript feels way too natural to

285
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,320
program these boards also you can use

286
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,540
the registry we can use whatever is on

287
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,840
the registry and enhance our development

288
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,280
experience so we can use loaders for

289
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,860
utilities you can use the Bluetooth API

290
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,950
web service whatever you can imagine if

291
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,230
we can bring the same experience from

292
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,730
the web

293
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,550
to the micro controllers also

294
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,740
portability it's a real thing

295
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,260
so even within the same family like they

296
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,510
are doing a family we have different

297
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,170
software and hardware specs from device

298
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,449
to device so they are do know is totally

299
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:34,040
different from the Arduino none of the

300
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,170
Arduino mega and so on but we can use

301
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,910
the same code for different devices and

302
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,199
that's actually awesome

303
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,089
and finally least but not last we have

304
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,240
to admit that it's in our DNA we are

305
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,949
trying to run JavaScript actually

306
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,350
everywhere so we want to make developers

307
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,360
have using JavaScript giving them the

308
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,550
ability to actually create products from

309
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,970
the web for the web for the server for

310
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,740
mobile devices smartwatches

311
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,110
so when not giving them the ability to

312
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,550
run code for a microcontroller right and

313
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,880
next up that was really rough period I

314
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,010
had to teach myself using something like

315
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,889
a 3d design software so that piece of

316
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:23,750
hardware that looks like a blue lasagna

317
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,500
that's a brag sell my original idea

318
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,569
please don't judge so my original idea

319
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,660
was that I could somehow create

320
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,949
individual bright cells that could be

321
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:36,079
easily attached or detached with the

322
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,410
device since this was a prototyping

323
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,760
period I could I used my own 3d printers

324
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,430
so it was really relatively easy to

325
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,529
design something evaluate the design and

326
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:53,600
keep the process going on and finally we

327
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,779
have to think how are you gonna actually

328
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:00,380
pop up in how can we translate data to

329
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,069
motion so as I kept experimenting with

330
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,010
different modules I have decided to

331
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,519
stick up with this little fellow this is

332
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,040
called the solenoid so solenoids are

333
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,490
like tiny push and pull actuators they

334
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,130
have a tiny electromagnet inside they

335
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,100
are actually used for watering systems

336
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,220
or electronic lock so using six

337
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,829
solenoids combined I can create a brake

338
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:29,630
cell since they're like six positions

339
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,140
per

340
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,160
CEL I purchased mine I purchased a bunch

341
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,480
of them for like a couple of bucks

342
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,110
online and finally we can bring

343
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,230
everything together so first things

344
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,410
first we have to think how we can

345
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,130
actually encode text brags so taking up

346
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,650
the alphabet numbers and symbols as you

347
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,510
can see we've done allocate an array of

348
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,330
six positions so zeros stand for Adel

349
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,210
pins and once stand for rest pins

350
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,130
unfortunately the brag alphabet ins is

351
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,110
not deterministic so we have to actually

352
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,760
create a map of all the available

353
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,510
characters letters and symbols and

354
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,240
afterwards we can create a symbol

355
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,890
utility function that takes up a

356
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,810
character as a single parameter and

357
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,910
turns the brag representation next up we

358
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,750
can create a really simple class that's

359
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,820
cell class in the constructor we are

360
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,250
using the allocated pin so we want six

361
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,930
pins from the board in order to control

362
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,070
it solenoid so we're using six pins as

363
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,830
an argument for the constructor and the

364
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,380
journey 5 instance and finally using a

365
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,690
private method that accepts a single

366
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,230
argument we can decide we can look

367
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,690
through the through the array of the

368
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,900
race the middle pins and decide if pin

369
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,890
is up or it's down so the this class is

370
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,310
stateful so we don't have to we don't

371
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,920
have to reset the pins it's time the

372
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,209
characters change and finally our main

373
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,490
product would look like this we're

374
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,530
including the 25 module we're including

375
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,220
the cell class we're initializing the

376
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,839
board and one of the board is ready

377
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,120
we're creating a new instance of the

378
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,720
brake cell using just six pins as an as

379
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,870
arguments and finally printing out the

380
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,230
character a so I think most of you are

381
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,090
quite bored right now so why not bring

382
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:44,770
up a live demo for you

383
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,150
okay let me break down the slide a bit

384
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:53,700
so as you can see I have here I have

385
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,240
life in from my camera this just be

386
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,100
honest with you this is my very first

387
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,870
time in the state and I got really

388
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,220
scared of getting detained at the

389
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,850
airport so so I had to break down a

390
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,580
device and I just bring with blood with

391
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,730
me a single character so my

392
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,730
interpretation runs using javascript and

393
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,770
HTML in my browser so um I have a live

394
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,510
feed from my camera on the right side on

395
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,570
the left side I have I'm using a

396
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,880
brilliant typeface called bright knowing

397
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,169
which will give you a visual

398
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:29,970
representation of the characters pretty

399
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,570
doubt and using the input text field on

400
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,760
the top I can write something and print

401
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,350
out print it out from the device just

402
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,020
like that so let's try to write

403
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,360
something meaningful rather than hello

404
00:18:45,360 --> 00:19:47,030
world okay cross your fingers

405
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,710
thank you so much so apparently our

406
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,750
prototype works it works have every

407
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,480
single time I promise you so let's bring

408
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,230
up some results as you can see I had no

409
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,400
prior experience with embedded

410
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,700
development but the embedded development

411
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,950
her family as well as the JavaScript

412
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,220
community are really helpful so building

413
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,120
up this device was relatively stable no

414
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,220
sophisticated coding no sophisticated

415
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,840
modules everything was purchased from

416
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,480
online so we can say we have achieved

417
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,140
that goal next up we can actually expand

418
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,840
this device so based on the number of

419
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,730
pins provided by the device we can

420
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,669
expire we can attach or detach browsers

421
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:42,750
on demand and finally we can bring up to

422
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:48,690
12 cells just for 40 bucks so we have to

423
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:55,350
think ourselves oh sorry what's next so

424
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,240
I wish as we speak I'm trying to

425
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,880
improvise the device I'm working on the

426
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,549
second version and I'm trying actually

427
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:08,850
to improve the design and get feedback

428
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,260
from from static groups from people that

429
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,600
could actually use this device in order

430
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,070
to learn bright also so naturally

431
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,620
beautiful prototyping but they're a bit

432
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,669
clunky and they're energy inefficient so

433
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:30,210
I think we can improve the design using

434
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,130
a piece of module called micro snipers

435
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,830
these are tiny tiny stepper modules that

436
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,250
are used in controlling camera lenses or

437
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,429
DVD Drive so we can actually recycle old

438
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:44,220
parts and improve the design using a

439
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,669
bunch of them and finally using micro

440
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:50,900
stepper motors we can bring we can

441
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,360
improve we can actually reduce the cost

442
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,460
of the actual device finally I think

443
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,860
people can use this same piece of

444
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,770
technology and create their own devices

445
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,230
like attach creating something like a

446
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,450
weather station for people that need to

447
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,850
know that weather using sensors modules

448
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,640
and so on and actually you can go beyond

449
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,700
25 and try different frameworks like

450
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,030
this premium one which is actually

451
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:24,660
project that runs JavaScript in the

452
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,460
microcontroller and for the past one

453
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,650
year and a half I kept dot I keep

454
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,360
talking and presenting this device to

455
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,280
people and I keep thinking I have

456
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,660
different talks with some colleagues of

457
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,490
mine and people that I meet at various

458
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,240
meetups and conferences and I have

459
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,670
thought about maybe trying to seek for

460
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,420
funding or raising crowds crowdfunding

461
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,490
campaign because I want more people to

462
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,740
have the ability to use this device and

463
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:01,380
actually help people but instead wanna

464
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,620
ask for your help so the entire

465
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,290
prototype is open-source and you can

466
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,210
find it online you can actually build

467
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,000
this device for yourself for yourselves

468
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,100
I think it's a great project to get you

469
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,020
started with the IOT world in the

470
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,070
upcoming months we I'm planning of

471
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,690
delivering the very first bright

472
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,420
open-source bright britain printer that

473
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,610
runs JavaScript as well so we're

474
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,530
experimenting with some wearables so

475
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,750
great things to come and I actually

476
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,690
think that we as the JavaScript

477
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,630
community we can do more so somehow we

478
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,720
do actually care and we are now openly

479
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,090
speaking about things that actually

480
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:52,160
matter this beyond the digital world and

481
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,450
if there's something that you can take

482
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,090
away from this presentation is the fact

483
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:01,440
that we are we have power in numbers

484
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,660
and we can actually really raise

485
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,350
awareness and at the at the very end we

486
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,560
can somehow affect the world thank you

487
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,180
so much for your time and patience

488
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,700
[Applause]
