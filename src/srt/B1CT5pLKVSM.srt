00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,380
hi it's me again

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,940
so yesterday noticed I'm into pretty

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,650
formal computer science II stuff and I

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,369
wanted to show you what you can do with

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,820
theoretical computer science and plants

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,099
so I'm not going to dive too deep into

8
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,160
it but you can describe plant growth the

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,019
way you describe human language with a

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,460
grammar a plant is basically just a seed

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,160
that grows and we start with the seed we

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,570
have one leaf then we have a couple of

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,469
leaves and the end we might have a tree

14
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:45,510
every step of that growth is a legit

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,920
plant so we can describe that with so

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,579
called generative grammars generative

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,210
grammars are grass that generate

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,010
sentences or other structures that can

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,050
be interpreted into sentences or plants

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,359
if you want to google that later you

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,159
should search fall into Maya systems or

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,060
else systems how does our grammar look

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,670
like we've got one thing that's called

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,040
the axiom that's the initial word or the

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,290
seed of the plant in our case and we

26
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,840
have replacement rules they describe how

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,840
the plant grows this is a replacement

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,090
rule you replace every occurrence of the

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,299
symbol on the left hand side with the

30
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,860
symbols on the right hand side not like

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,180
it's written here but the other way

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,590
around

33
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,229
I'll show you so on the left side we

34
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,409
have rules for SLR

35
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,380
our first word is the s in the next

36
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,890
iteration we replace the s with LS then

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,320
we replace the s and the new word and

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
the L in the new world and so on so the

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,540
board or it gets longer every step this

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,820
is not really a word yet and that's not

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,950
a word that we can understand but we can

42
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,049
apply a transformation function that

43
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,909
translate it into something that we

44
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,500
understand that might be actually human

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,110
words but also can be plants so you

46
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,060
could write a function that draws this

47
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,480
word onto canvas into a frame or WebGL

48
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,610
so the theoretical foundation for that

49
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,810
is the same and the cool part would be

50
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,299
how to translate it into a tree and I

51
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:24,459
want to show you one way to do it with

52
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,769
canvas and so called charter graphics

53
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:28,930
how they work if you never heard of

54
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,090
title graphics before just imagine a

55
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,989
turtle with a pen and the turtle with

56
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,239
the pen is following directions so for

57
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,010
example an S would mean draw straight

58
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,290
line and L would mean turn left and then

59
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,950
R would mean turn right so for that word

60
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,230
we have here first would be drawing a

61
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,599
straight line that we turn left draw

62
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,940
sight line again turn right turn right

63
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,450
trust right line turn left again and

64
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,500
draw a line I had started graphics and

65
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,140
I'll show you how this is actually used

66
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,980
by someone this there's a repository by

67
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,799
John Bravo for Lindenmayer systems in

68
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:11,620
JavaScript that has some nice code

69
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,959
prints you can play around with and also

70
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,790
it's super accessible and super well

71
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:21,010
documented this is the first iteration

72
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,040
the first part of a tree the grammar is

73
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,389
here on the side it's not super

74
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:26,739
important how it looks like it's a bit

75
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,319
complicated if you've never looked at

76
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,730
this before but just to show you what

77
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,090
you can do you see that shape that goes

78
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,480
to lines up and one to the side and from

79
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,900
this shape the whole tree will grow and

80
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,730
I'll just show you by increasing the

81
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,280
iterations that we're going or we can

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,440
actually draw the tree with it and

83
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,459
that's Lindenmayer systems that's a way

84
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,350
to describe plant growth with grammar

85
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,970
