1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,670

before before I actually start I need a

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,849
couple of things from you guys I need an

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,030
iPhone six-plus does anyone have an

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,969
iPhone six-plus can I borrow that I will

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,100
I will not damage it I promise you was

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,930
very reluctant always Canadian that's

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,070
why thank you very much

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,489
and I also need a tissue I didn't I

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,200
didn't bring my own tissues and I need I

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
really need a tissue oh okay perfect

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,730
all right okay with that I can actually

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,030
go in character and do this talk I am

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,829
I'm running Windows 2000 I've seen a lot

14
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,820
of very startup sound I've seen a lot of

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,739
very amazing operating systems that look

16
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,960
like they must be experimental Apple

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,420
projects but I'm running good old

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,110
Windows 2000

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,600
all right my name is Gary Bernhardt I'm

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,850
very happy to be here at demo comp and

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,160
this talk is a survey of where we are

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,080
how we got here where we might go and

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,620
how great everything is this is the

24
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,180
stock price of Apple over roughly the

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,980
last year from quarter four ninety nine

26
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,950
until now you can see there was a brief

27
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,080
uptick and then it has crashed to about

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,050
ten percent of of its stock pricey

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,720
about a year ago Microsoft is a little

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,730
bit better off they are they're down to

31
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,390
about half what they were a year ago

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,890
simultaneously with this I don't think

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,570
it's a coincidence this has happened in

34
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,520
the same year that Linux has become very

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,810
usable on the desktop this is this is

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,490
enlightenment 16 running the brushed

37
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,830
metal theme probably the most widely

38
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,230
used one there are many others this is a

39
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,510
really cool theme there are some that

40
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,550
are just really strange and if i zoom in

41
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,290
you can see there are super cool fonts

42
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,070
in this enlightenment theme and I think

43
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,000
what's I don't know what table 2 is I'm

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,030
sorry this I think what's happening here

45
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,010
is that Linux on the desktop has finally

46
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,320
become viable and everyone is switching

47
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,900
to it and that is what is happening to

48
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,790
Microsoft and Apple and this is

49
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,780
happening because no one wants

50
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,040
proprietary operating systems

51
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,410
everyone now even our parents understand

52
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,180
that software freedom freedom as in

53
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,130
speech is the most important thing about

54
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,459
a software system and regular people now

55
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,040
care about this which means the

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,989
mainstream is switching now you may have

57
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:42,640
noticed that I'm running Windows 2000

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,860
there is a reason that I'm doing that

59
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,120
and that is I could not get external

60
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,680
displays to work I am sure that external

61
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,720
displays will be working at any time in

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,810
the near future because with many bug or

63
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,420
with many eyes all bugs are shallow you

64
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,800
you may recognize this guy this is a

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,460
bonsai buddy but

66
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,380
before your parents switched to Linux on

67
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,580
their desktops you may have had to

68
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,740
remove this from their machines or you

69
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,580
may have had to deal with a lot of

70
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,450
toolbars on their machines and of course

71
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,520
everyone knows pop-unders you close your

72
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,600
browser window and there's a there's

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,100
another window under it with an ad in it

74
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,800
all of these are terrible scourge is

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,450
that we want to fight we want to fight

76
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,600
these invasive forms of advertising now

77
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,770
we are making some technical headway

78
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,040
here

79
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,500
Mozilla now blocks pop-ups as of a few

80
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,320
months ago so that's a great start but I

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,340
think what's going to happen in the long

82
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,500
term is that we no one likes

83
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,300
advertisements right nobody chooses to

84
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,460
see them and we all know that the web is

85
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,420
a free democratic meritocracy and if it

86
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,850
is true that the web gives the users of

87
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,070
the web what they want and no one wants

88
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,990
ads then it must also be true that the

89
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,240
ads will die and I think that's what's

90
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,200
happening I think that's what we're

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,450
seeing with with this push back against

92
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,040
pop-ups now at this point in the talk

93
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,780
for some reason I often get a nosebleed

94
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,500
and it's as if my bot my body is

95
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,360
rejecting something in deeply

96
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,950
contradictory in my mind but there's

97
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,030
nothing contradictory here so I don't

98
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,950
know what that would be but I'm going to

99
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,620
just preemptively take care of that for

100
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,739
a moment so I'll be I'll be right back

101
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,710
just I'm sorry this is very vulgar for

102
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:36,480
me to do this but oh okay

103
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:42,819
I feel I feel much better now now this

104
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:46,720
is the the w3 C's page for their markup

105
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,340
languages and I want to highlight part

106
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,789
of it for you the the w3 s work provides

107
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:53,050
richer web pages on an ever-increasing

108
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,910
range of browser platforms including

109
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,039
cell phones televisions cars wallet size

110
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,130
wallet communicators your wallet size

111
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,930
wireless communicators kiosks and

112
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,030
desktops when they say wallet size while

113
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,160
it but I can't even say that wallet size

114
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,419
wireless communicator I think they mean

115
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,250
something like a like a palm write this

116
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,919
is actually a handspring visor but it's

117
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,900
a clone of a palm this is not wireless

118
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,810
unfortunately but in the near future you

119
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,599
can imagine these being Wireless and and

120
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,340
the web has to adapt to that or when

121
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,240
they say a cell phone they mean

122
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,599
something like my brand new Nokia 82 60

123
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,270
and this thing it's a great phone I

124
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,500
recommend it it's my first cell phone

125
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,750
it's really it's it's weird to be

126
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,130
connected all the time this this phone

127
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,630
does not have web support but things

128
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,030
like this will soon be supporting web

129
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,070
technologies this is another part of the

130
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,740
same page they're talking about XHTML

131
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,930
here which is HTML as an XML schema and

132
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,180
they say the modular design of XHTML

133
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,770
reflects the realization that a

134
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,360
one-size-fits-all approach will no

135
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,310
longer work in a world where browsers

136
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,840
very enormous leaner capabilities a

137
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,360
browser and cell phone can't etc etc so

138
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,270
the w3c knows that the technology is

139
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,710
changing that the devices are changing

140
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,630
and they're updating the standards to

141
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,539
fit them and I think that this is

142
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,969
wonderful a wonderful thing that's

143
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,919
happening that they know they see the

144
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,949
problems coming and are adapting to them

145
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,100
in advance

146
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,250
there are many web standards of course

147
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,990
not just like stage tml there's CSS

148
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,449
which is pretty widely used now there's

149
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:26,620
ecla script which you probably haven't

150
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,669
heard of but this is it's the it's the

151
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:33,789
standardized form of JavaScript and it's

152
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,590
really a wonderful story because because

153
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,289
Brendan only had ten days to design the

154
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:39,900
the JavaScript programming language and

155
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,979
fortunately thousands of people have

156
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:44,469
dedicated hundreds of thousands of hours

157
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:47,320
of their human finite lives to

158
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,969
standardizing that language not changing

159
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:50,370
it but just standardizing it and right

160
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,070
all down and arguing about what the real

161
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,070
semantics are etc etc so that's

162
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,690
wonderful

163
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,030
moving on to our fourth and final topic

164
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,310
before we merge all these together this

165
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,449
is a plot of the number of transistors

166
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:06,090
in various CPUs over time my first

167
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,490
computer four years ago in 96 was a 46

168
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,979
you can see that Pentium 4 has far far

169
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,389
more transistors and this has always

170
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,930
been true it just keeps going up and up

171
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,229
and I can't see anyway any reason to

172
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,720
this would stop happening in the near

173
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,760
future or even the distant future it

174
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,280
seems like it just has to keep going and

175
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,600
going and going and getting better and

176
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,870
better this on the other hand is the

177
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,970
size of computers over time and this is

178
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,639
a logarithmic scale so the first

179
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,229
programmable general-purpose electrical

180
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:39,510
electronic computer was the ENIAC in 46

181
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,270
it was about if you made it a cube it

182
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,910
would be 4 meters on a side that's a big

183
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,940
cube pdp-1 is about the size of a phone

184
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,699
booth IBM PC is maybe the size of this

185
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,490
podium an iBook the new laptop from

186
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,870
Apple you've probably seen one of those

187
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,200
and then my 82 60 is about point zero

188
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,130
zero zero zero one square meter or cubic

189
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,289
meters as opposed to 64 cubic meters for

190
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,349
an e niak now I don't see any reason

191
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:10,050
that this would stop happening I mean

192
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,000
computers have to keep getting smaller

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,280
right as time goes on devices are only

194
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,639
going to get smaller in the future 15

195
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,900
years from now we'll probably this thing

196
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,250
will be the size of a postage stamp I

197
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,349
imagine and we'll just kind of unfold it

198
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:26,639
and do our computering and just kind of

199
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,810
wrinkle it up and throw it in our pocket

200
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,780
or something so hard we're always gets

201
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,199
better

202
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,539
CPUs get faster and faster I mean where

203
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,610
we're going to be at 800 megahertz than

204
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,680
a gigahertz then 2 gigahertz and 4 than

205
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,839
8 then 16 gigahertz it's never going to

206
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,390
stop doubling at any time disks are

207
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,260
going to keep getting bigger you're

208
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,730
going to have a one gig drive one year

209
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,040
later two gigs then 4 then 8 and 16

210
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,570
every single year just like we always

211
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,060
have devices are going to keep getting

212
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,709
smaller this phone will look comically

213
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,300
large in 15 years I'm sure

214
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,589
so we've talked about four topics we

215
00:08:58,589 --> 00:08:59,940
have we have the rise of Linux on the

216
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,069
desktop we have the death of advertising

217
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:06,540
we have these increasing HTML standards

218
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,339
like it's XHTML that are going to adapt

219
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,560
to the future web needs of the future

220
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,660
needs of web systems and we have

221
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,250
Hardware getting smaller and smaller and

222
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,959
faster and faster and now I want to

223
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,079
imagine what future all of these could

224
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:21,139
could combine to give us

225
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,279
well the devices of course are going to

226
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,810
be smaller I imagined something postage

227
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,339
stamp-sized would be a really nice form

228
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,439
factor they're going to be running Linux

229
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,959
open source top to bottom because why

230
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,579
wouldn't they be open source is clearly

231
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:34,980
better as we all know browsing a web

232
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,740
without ads and running some kind of

233
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,959
applications that are using like very

234
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,079
strict correct markup using very

235
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:46,079
powerful static languages maybe derive

236
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,180
from Java maybe even Drive from

237
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,439
JavaScript

238
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:51,870
who knows maybe some other third thing

239
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,610
that doesn't even exist yet now my

240
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,560
clicker not working there we go

241
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,990
I'm now going to I think my nosebleed is

242
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,550
done so I'm just going to give me a

243
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:18,960
second and I'll be right back

244
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,860
again I'm just going to leave this over

245
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:27,190
here so things are getting better and

246
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,780
better software is getting better and

247
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,720
better all the time

248
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,030
and I want to just sort of sort of

249
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,340
summarize my my message for you

250
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,190
here the way to the future is just to do

251
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,970
more of the same

252
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,830
just keep doing the same thing we've

253
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,280
always done x86 it's been great so far

254
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,780
you know take it to a gigahertz take it

255
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,900
to - take it to 4 8 gigahertz just keep

256
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,440
making it faster and faster HTML I mean

257
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,600
it's been pretty great for the last 7

258
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
years just keep just keep doing it I

259
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,010
guess for a few decades no need to

260
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,640
change it even really XML a little bit

261
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,320
even JavaScript you know everyone hates

262
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,790
JavaScript I mean who here has ever

263
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,030
written JavaScript on purpose like

264
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,710
there's there's the one man in the back

265
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,760
corner

266
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,320
I respect you sir but no one no one

267
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,930
chooses JavaScript however I think that

268
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,750
if we really try really hard we might be

269
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,880
able to over the course of a decade or

270
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,860
two convince ourselves that we might

271
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,500
actually like it a little bit I I'm

272
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,150
optimistic that we can do that if we

273
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,790
really want to and most importantly

274
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,170
remember everything always gets better

275
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,880
nothing ever addresses everything just

276
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,670
marches forward in a straight monotonic

277
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,420
line towards perfection

278
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,160
Clippy suggested this I'm not sure why I

279
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,710
think it might be the word future that

280
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,730
got me this gift but I'm not sure to

281
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,410
close out I really I would like to I

282
00:11:53,410 --> 00:12:00,730
would like to thank so that possibly

283
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,660
really paid off

284
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,810
I would like to thank our platinum level

285
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,339
sponsor excite at home I think they're

286
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,589
going to be doing big things them it's

287
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:11,410
the the merger of two wonderful

288
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,120
companies I'd like to thank our

289
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,860
organizer Jen Schiffer for putting this

290
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,810
on and for for inviting me to speak I

291
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,910
like to thank Clippy for just suggesting

292
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,980
all those great pictures so thank you
