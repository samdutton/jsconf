1
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,730

my talk is called Caesar j/s and it

2
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,019
might not be well I was giving some

3
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:25,599
JavaScript but it's primarily going to

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,230
be about a great cocktail called the

5
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,660
Caesar which was it's a canadian thing

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,519
and I'm Canadian so I thought I'd talk

7
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:36,640
about it up at the front here Andrew

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,170
Lonny who is just giving a presentation

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,659
he'll actually be making Caesars for

10
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:43,449
anyone that's interested while I'm

11
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:46,390
giving the talk and so he can

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,949
demonstrate actually for you if you want

13
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:51,729
to see what it's all about hey virgin

14
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:57,369
Caesars yeah sorry how my name is dave

15
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:00,640
johnson from company called nitobe in

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,170
vancouver canada work on phonegap and

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,530
rather hungover right now so does

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,100
anybody have any good hangover cures

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,680
anyone I don't know maybe like a voodoo

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,229
doughnut with bacon on top that might be

21
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:20,680
a good hangover cure often times when

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,540
I'm hungover like this though I like to

23
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,500
ask myself what would Don Draper do and

24
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:33,490
I'm pretty sure he'd do this so as i

25
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,350
mentioned i'm from canada seized our

26
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,420
canadian thing it's essentially a bloody

27
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,540
mary as people in the rest of the world

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,530
american particular i guess we'll know

29
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,400
it's essentially Bloody Mary except for

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,100
it's got one special special ingredient

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,000
so there's a bloody mary or a caesar

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,810
can't really tell it's sort of red

33
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,180
though so you start off with tomato

34
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,510
juice and obviously it's just like a

35
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,150
Bloody Mary but you add the one secret

36
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,570
ingredient which is clam nectar so when

37
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,430
you mix tomato juice and clam nectar you

38
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,390
get something called Clamato juice I was

39
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,590
actually thinking like bringing some

40
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,150
real clams and making some clam nectar

41
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,480
but I decided not and so in Canada we

42
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,670
have something called mots Clamato which

43
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,599
is a pre pre mixed clam nectar and

44
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,640
tomato juice and you can get some right

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,230
up here there Steve's holding up a nice

46
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,880
bottle we got like six liters that we

47
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,060
brought down I'm surprised they didn't

48
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,580
at the border so the whole idea of this

49
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,580
came about from some dude in Canada and

50
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,880
he was eating I can't pronounce what

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,319
this is dishes but it's some sort of

52
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,470
spaghetti dish that's clammed and in

53
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,120
spaghetti so it's obviously tomato sauce

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,060
and clams and he was like wow tomato

55
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,980
sauce and clams tastes awesome

56
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,310
so I'm going to make a drink out of it

57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,660
I'm pretty sure this guy was a drunkard

58
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,660
as well so he actually lived in the fine

59
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,489
City of Calgary where the Calgary Flames

60
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:06,519
play hockey who are not in the playoffs

61
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,420
at the moment and it was invented back

62
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,000
in nineteen sixty-nine the same year

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,019
that the gap was founded coincidence

64
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,540
probably so this actually mots Clamato

65
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,280
there's like this weird collective

66
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,750
consciousness going on as well

67
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,209
because the the motts company they

68
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,670
actually invented mots Clamato that same

69
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,959
year coincidence see that's less

70
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,480
collective consciousness you right there

71
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,430
so they actually sold I think 500 cases

72
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:45,209
of mots Clamato in 1975 across Canada so

73
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,829
yeah totally weird and now today there

74
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:50,260
are 350 million Caesars consumed yearly

75
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,780
in Canada and just to give you scale i

76
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,100
mean that's that's about like ten

77
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,209
caesars per person per year so one every

78
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,440
yeah twenty percent of your weekends

79
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,010
year you're drinking a Caesar in Canada

80
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,430
so the recipe like I said Andrew my man

81
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,530
right here who did our amazing hangover

82
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,630
jazz talk right then he's actually

83
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,170
making some drinks for us and i'm just

84
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:20,410
drinking Clamato hmmm climb nectar so

85
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,400
the recipe six ounces of Clamato juice

86
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,229
one and a half ounces or one to one half

87
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:29,250
ounces of vodka I prefer to but you know

88
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,770
two dashes of hot sauce four dashes of

89
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,080
work Chester Shire I believe that's

90
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,780
right pronunciation Andrew

91
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,699
four dashes of Worcestershire sauce

92
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,469
celery salt and let me tell you I could

93
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:44,840
not find that at the grocery store last

94
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,629
night fresh ground pepper actually I

95
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:48,860
couldn't get vodka last night either

96
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,419
because I didn't have my passport with

97
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,340
me which apparently you don't need to

98
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,599
get into the country but you need it to

99
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:58,580
buy alcohol not that we don't have

100
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,469
alcohol fresh ground pepper and a lime

101
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,719
wedge of course you need that so what

102
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:06,860
you do is you actually take the lime

103
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,749
wedge and Andres doing this right now

104
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:12,800
you you cut it and you you actually run

105
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,719
it run it around the rim of the glass to

106
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,789
get some liquid on there you have your

107
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:19,460
salt in a little basket and you put the

108
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,830
put the glass upside down in there get

109
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,039
some salt on there throw in your ice so

110
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,110
in your dashes of hot sauce your worst

111
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,740
your sauce your Clamato and your vodka

112
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,259
stir it up a tad add a piece of celery

113
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:36,020
or you can also add you know green beans

114
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,020
or any other like a lot of pickled stuff

115
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,779
is always good in there and then pretty

116
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,680
much you're in like hangover heaven yeah

117
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,150
there you go one crisp celery stalks

118
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,379
also my salary is limp the seller i

119
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,099
bought yesterday i mean you know it's

120
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:57,680
limp because it's at out overnight so

121
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,300
this it doesn't have quite the same

122
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,279
effect today but at any rate it will

123
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,849
still work for the hangover i think so

124
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:07,639
some people will insist on replacing the

125
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,620
vodka with either rum tequila or gin

126
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:19,149
whoa no there we go oh my god yeah so

127
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:23,060
 that that's crazy it has to be

128
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,629
that that's crazy it has to be
vodka so others however will use things

129
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,939
like Tim Hortons coffee grounds around

130
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,939
the top of the cup to that I say

131
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:37,430
yeah or bacon infused vodka yeah that's

132
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,699
got to be tasty in there or maple syrup

133
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,159
hey be from Canada who wouldn't love

134
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,860
maple syrup so that's let's full on by

135
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,120
winning right there

136
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,500
yeah I mean maybe if you had a maple

137
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,020
syrup bacon infused vodka and Tim

138
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,400
Hortons coffee grounds to a Caesar

139
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,810
that's got to be pretty much the best

140
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,690
drink ever that's a hangover Buster

141
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,580
right there and Andrew looks like he's

142
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,290
pretty much got his first Cesar oh man

143
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:11,740
look at that look at that it's the thing

144
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:19,720
of beauty oh that's terrible okay so

145
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,060
that's perfect timing Andrew it's as if

146
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,600
we like plan that or something okay I'm

147
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
still very hungover it'll take a minute

148
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,380
here but now I'm going to actually talk

149
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,590
about a little bit of JavaScript because

150
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,790
it's sort of interesting stuff I guess

151
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,450
and something that it's a little library

152
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,950
that we're sort of just coming up with I

153
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,930
guess it's sort of put in the first

154
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,100
commit like five minutes ago and it's

155
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,040
just something called high five and it

156
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,460
sort of stands for html5 and it's meant

157
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,190
to be a sane rapper to html5 api's so we

158
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,020
all do love web standards right man that

159
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,400
w3c way to go you're doing an awesome

160
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,540
job you know we need that stuff however

161
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,660
the the sad part is the most those api's

162
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,540
look like so I'm going to I'm going

163
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,220
to go over 3 of the API is in particular

164
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,100
that are getting better but still suck

165
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,910
and need to be wrapped in a library such

166
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:31,180
as high five so exhibit a navigator

167
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,180
geolocation got watch position win fail

168
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,979
options right so watch position I'm sure

169
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,820
a lot of you will know what this does it

170
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,530
calls back to your win handler whenever

171
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,930
there is an update to your position so

172
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,310
it looks a lot like an event handler

173
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,100
actually am i right I mean we all know

174
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,050
we all know how to use event handlers so

175
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,510
I don't know why they didn't think of

176
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,080
doing like this maybe do document even

177
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,850
whatever could be device or something

178
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,139
something better than navigator

179
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,630
geolocation watch position you can

180
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,029
document to add event listener location

181
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,490
your handler and some options so pretty

182
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,139
much just like Oh using add event

183
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:15,040
listener wouldn't that be something so

184
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,440
the idea then with high five would be

185
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,139
something more like this and this

186
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:21,550
ideally would be chainable and so on and

187
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,860
so forth and you know using all the good

188
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,019
javascript stuff that we who actually

189
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,130
write JavaScript know and love yeah so

190
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,690
something like this high five on

191
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:37,089
location and a handler oh it's getting

192
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,170
better and the handler could you know it

193
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,579
could handle your air state and your

194
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,139
success state rather than having to

195
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,329
passing your two separate handlers for

196
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:50,680
win and fail so this is sort of the the

197
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,040
proposition that high five wood or the

198
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,649
API the high five would create and this

199
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,120
sort of works right now but I think this

200
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,500
is the only thing that works and even

201
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,079
then it probably doesn't I do have one

202
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,620
passing test I think and then the other

203
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,839
thing would be doing high five done so

204
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,480
you can unsubscribe to your location

205
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,639
event so right now you would do

206
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,790
navigator dodgy location dot clear watch

207
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,699
I think and you you passing your

208
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:22,120
and it's silly then you also have things

209
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,279
in geolocation like get current position

210
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,630
so just you want to get your one

211
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,810
position and that's it so a simple way

212
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,800
of doing that would be something like

213
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,529
this high five dot one where rather than

214
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:36,189
doing on where it continually set sends

215
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:39,100
back your location to your handler high

216
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,589
five dot one would instead essentially

217
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:43,959
auto unsubscribe so to subscribe it once

218
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,759
it gets back the first location position

219
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,579
then it would auto unsubscribe itself so

220
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,439
this is equivalent to doing get current

221
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:55,149
position in the geolocation example okay

222
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:59,050
Exhibit B has no one come up for a

223
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,860
seizure yet this is terrible I can't

224
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,779
believe in andrew i'm selling it really

225
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,350
good i think

226
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,600
so Exhibit B device motion so someone

227
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,110
somewhere actually came up with a bit

228
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,230
better idea in device motion so device

229
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,440
motion is essentially your accelerometer

230
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,330
in phonegap itself we went and because

231
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,740
we were implementing these things a long

232
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,840
time ago we actually did it like the

233
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,110
geolocation case and we did navigator

234
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,750
accelerometer dot get current

235
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,520
acceleration or watch acceleration on

236
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,460
super ugly stuff so in the latest for

237
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,470
example Mobile Safari they support this

238
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,230
and this is in the w3c device motion is

239
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,670
your accelerometer so hey this is good

240
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,800
looks like an event right window de on

241
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,190
device motion much better but what's

242
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,520
inside of it your event object has

243
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,200
something called acceleration including

244
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,030
gravity X that's insane screw that this

245
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,160
is just crazy so they were going really

246
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,560
well but then they it up so why not

247
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,380
just do this I don't know a lot fewer

248
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,900
characters we just do high five dot on

249
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,120
motion so we don't even need the device

250
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,070
stuff either I mean I think we're

251
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,090
getting to a point where that sort of

252
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,620
implied like what else are you thinking

253
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,410
of when you want a document motion or a

254
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,920
device that motion so anyway I get rid

255
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,320
of that don't add on like device motion

256
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,260
change or device motion different from

257
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,440
the previous motion value don't do stuff

258
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,530
like that keep it as simple as possible

259
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:40,460
get your event that x y&z ok Exhibit C

260
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,660
good stuff

261
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,320
device orientation this is similar to

262
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,579
device motion it's a bit long as well it

263
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:52,870
could be better for just orientation and

264
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,640
then the awesome part here is in the

265
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,760
event object we have a beta gamma and y

266
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,050
alpha who knows what those are well

267
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,870
obviously it's this come on and bless

268
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,910
its heart Euler he's a he was a smart

269
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,649
dude I love what he did for that stuff I

270
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,660
should really know this I like do

271
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,060
physics or something but anyway oil is

272
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,890
awesome but really come on we're

273
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,079
JavaScript developers we don't want to

274
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,050
know what alpha beta and gamma are so

275
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,560
let's just do x y&z orientation so you

276
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,899
can check it out here github com high

277
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:31,570
five high five a lot of people are

278
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,279
showing like this sweet spot graph for

279
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,870
some reason in some of the presentations

280
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,000
so I was like oh well here's my sweet

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,800
spot so high five is toll winning in

282
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,070
JavaScript Crockfords mostly JavaScript

283
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,320
Twila she's mostly winning clam nectar

284
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,420
is neither and then yes of course i

285
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,660
bought the airline other a few guys in

286
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,820
need media file system system info

287
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,779
persistence so all of these are horribly

288
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:01,209
disgusting AP is and w3c we should wrap

289
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:03,940
those keep the underlying API is going

290
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,800
with w3c yeah that's fine whatever but

291
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,350
yeah make a higher level API on there

292
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,600
that's actually usable in our apps thank
