00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:17,880

hi everybody very glad to be here

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,939
speaking to you guys about it so I'm

3
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,970
here to talk about our Airbnb brand

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,650
evolution which we launched in july of

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,289
this year so before I can talk about the

6
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,119
brand evolution I got to introduce a

7
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,410
little bit about the history about

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,410
Airbnb so who here in the house has ever

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,690
used Airbnb before whoa yeah so Airbnb

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,370
was born in 2008 when originally known

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,890
as air bed and breakfast so our founders

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,760
Joe and Brian they they were they were

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,809
running out of money and they couldn't

14
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,760
pay rent but there was a big conference

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,480
in town called a design conference and

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,190
just like CSS come actually and they

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,379
were thinking what if we hosted a bunch

18
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,359
of people and let them stay in a house

19
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,820
and you know charge them like fifty

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,040
dollars a night and so they do have a

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,060
bunch of air beds and hosted some guests

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,130
there and give them breakfast and from

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,140
then on they known as air bed breakfast

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,950
and over the past six years the company

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,689
has grown a lot right now we have 119

26
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:29,820
listings in 190 countries and and and we

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,350
are on track to host over 30 million

28
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,729
nights of stage this year so given that

29
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,860
you know maybe we don't want to be just

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,259
another internet company for bubbling

31
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,840
blue logo this isn't this off some of

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,090
the internet companies they all have new

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,159
logos and and as we are maturing into a

34
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,689
hostelry company maybe we need to

35
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,729
advance beyond the contour of life we

36
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,730
are blue we are techne and

37
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,260
we are cool or something so the the

38
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,270
designers last year they set out to work

39
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,760
on a new brand identity is a bunch of

40
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,600
designers and hanging out and looking at

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,750
different pictorial representations of

42
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,070
things that are important to a brand

43
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,440
like listings and hosts and so after

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,780
they came of this cave and it came up

45
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,560
with the new brand and presented to us

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,930
so you guys may recognizes this is our

47
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,930
new logo it's called the Baylor but

48
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,550
internally and kind of called a pretzel

49
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,280
because it kind of looks like a pretzel

50
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,420
and then we had a new vibrant color

51
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,000
palette like very you fool very exciting

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,700
colors and the new brand would have a

53
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,070
better focus on our community I guess

54
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,630
and a horse and all these things around

55
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,630
the globe so this came through my the

56
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,210
level of my team in january of this year

57
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,640
you know basically turn the old old

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,580
website into like a new website and so

59
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,490
we set out to make your reality and let

60
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,050
me talk to a designer differently have

61
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,640
this understanding of what every brand

62
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,680
is you know just change the logo at a

63
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,209
few hex codes and you should be done in

64
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,420
like a couple of days right okay well

65
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,450
it's wrong because everyone is basically

66
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,090
an engineer's worst nightmare first you

67
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,400
got you have a hardship date there's no

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,510
flex 2 is a fickle you need to change

69
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,090
the whole website three initially top

70
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,340
secret and for you need to do with

71
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,340
legacy code and not just any legacy code

72
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,640
but legacy CSS which is not very fun so

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,739
then we started thinking about how we

74
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:39,320
could ship this project and remain sane

75
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,959
at the same time and this is tree of the

76
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,660
main principles that we had first having

77
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,970
a say in CSS architecture so that we

78
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,980
wouldn't find ourselves hand changing

79
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,000
like thousands of lines of CSS second

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
being able to test and measure the

81
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,110
progress making sure that on the launch

82
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,620
day

83
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,330
everything goes right and I still have a

84
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,659
job and the third is scalable across the

85
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,180
site because we have so many different

86
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,819
products that we need to change so first

87
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,319
thing talking about same CSS

88
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,830
architecture just we want to have

89
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,870
approached the CSS that doesn't drive

90
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,780
anyone nuts which may not be that easy

91
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,680
because the CSS so Xzibit one of typical

92
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,580
CSS code this is actually real quote

93
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,280
from our site so I'm not exactly the

94
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,210
most proud of it as we heard from a

95
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,430
Christian earlier today you should not

96
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,620
have any ID selectors and injustice two

97
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,840
lines of code we have over like five ID

98
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,240
selectors so it's very sad so given this

99
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,340
state of the CSS imagine going through

100
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,370
thousands of lines of CSS and removing

101
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,880
all the rounded corners text shadows

102
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,190
standardizing the 13 or 14 or I don't

103
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,110
know 200 sheets of free doesn't sound

104
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,289
fun right and what kind of accessory

105
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,240
baited it for us is the Airbnb over the

106
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,460
past six years has had a tremendous

107
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,220
group which is great because I have a

108
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,530
job but it's bad because it's hard to

109
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,510
focus on quality and we have so many

110
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,099
different business challenges that we

111
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,020
are trying to put out the latest fires

112
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,000
and building the latest features and

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,610
it's so hard to focus on quality and so

114
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,919
the amount of CSS we had just kept

115
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,979
growing and growing and growing and to

116
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:28,250
me at CSS the power CSS is that at some

117
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,650
point about like let's say a thousand

118
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,979
lines of code you have your a past that

119
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,990
point you are unable to like read over

120
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,340
the code and figure out what it's doing

121
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,150
because it's it's so real it's not real

122
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,919
it's rarely tested you don't know that

123
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,169
in fact of your change and it's just so

124
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:47,150
easy for you to slap on an ID like

125
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,720
Christian said to to just fix that that

126
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,039
visual bug that you have and so I kind

127
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,470
of want to bring in the sentiment

128
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,450
this guy called Michael feathers who

129
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,920
wrote a book on dealing with legacy code

130
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,560
and the definition of legacy code is

131
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,950
basically any code that's untested and

132
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,740
by the definition all CSS is legacy code

133
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,580
all right table because by definition

134
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,170
CSS is not it's usually not tested you

135
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,810
there's no way to understand in fact of

136
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,760
your changes so in a way it's kind of

137
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,170
true but that's not the end of the world

138
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,630
that's actually a better way to do CSS

139
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,840
and this is a quote thing the easiest

140
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,670
way to keep your quarantine avoids to

141
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,710
write less of it and that applies for

142
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,960
Ruby code or JavaScript code it also

143
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,570
applies for CSS code so what does it

144
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,660
mean to write less CSS code so we have a

145
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,240
concept of CSS frameworks they can write

146
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,280
once and reuse so that nobody you don't

147
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,810
need to reinvent the wheel for every

148
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,760
single button inside you can write a

149
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,370
room for one button and it just works

150
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,620
and bootstrap and foundation are two of

151
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,590
the CSS frameworks as right of the box

152
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,580
and so luckily for Airbnb even though we

153
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,590
had to deal with six thousands of nigel

154
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,380
CSS we were actually working on my

155
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,270
natural CSS framework that we called 02

156
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,580
which was based upon bootstrap but

157
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,780
called down for a specific use case and

158
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,150
we have been working on this for about a

159
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,890
few months and we've begun rolling out

160
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,870
to be about ten percent of the pages by

161
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,020
the time the rebrand project started I'm

162
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,940
gonna make a side note about why we call

163
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,740
it 02 because it sounds very sciency

164
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,010
it's kind of a nerdy job because 02 is

165
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,530
the scientific notation for oxygen and

166
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:45,900
you can't have air BnB with oxygen

167
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,790
so so we had this framework called 02

168
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,880
and and on the left is 10 to look like

169
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,190
at a stop the project and so we had this

170
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,850
idea you know given our new rebrand

171
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,420
feeling rebrand designs what if we just

172
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,400
update the skin 402 and you see on the

173
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,760
right is all the same elements but just

174
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,670
in a slightly different style and

175
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,230
preserving the same Dom API like four

176
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,150
button in the old way it's called a

177
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,100
button primary and it's a blue button

178
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,590
and then in a rebrand ways it's still

179
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,360
called button by it just has a slightly

180
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,960
different color and this is kind of

181
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,870
magical because if we basically promised

182
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,180
like all the engineers across the side

183
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,280
and if you use o 2 components you get an

184
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,580
instant rebrand because whatever means

185
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,470
is that if you use auto components will

186
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,570
just change the CSS framework out for

187
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,560
you and you don't even need to do

188
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,670
anything get new styles so this is an

189
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,820
example of a page that use only Oh two

190
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,270
components and and when we just change

191
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,940
out the different version of 02 it looks

192
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,840
completely different and it's a great

193
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,000
formats because then you can scale the

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,160
rebrand across the site without having

195
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,410
to write that many lines of CSS and

196
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,560
everyone wins so another aspect I wanted

197
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,330
to make sure is making sure that we are

198
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,430
testable that we are progresses test boy

199
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,470
immeasurable making sure that we don't

200
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,230
have any surprises on launch day given a

201
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,670
bit of a hardship they won't make sure

202
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,710
that on July 17 that everything works

203
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,630
and then hopefully have to have a job so

204
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,330
what we did was that we made this button

205
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,730
call that a lot of people to switch

206
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,980
between the odd version and the

207
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,990
rebranded version and we call it the

208
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,620
branch st button and by the branch st za

209
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,480
co and he was very excited about it

210
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,370
because he was like now I can go on

211
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,170
airbnb com and you know just click this

212
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,209
button and see what my

213
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,999
my baby my site looks like after the

214
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:52,939
rebrand but it wasn't just Brian De you

215
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:55,790
stood beside even though Brian really

216
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,589
care a lot about it what we did was we

217
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:00,259
wrote it out to all air BMA Airbnb

218
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,410
employees so that designers engineers

219
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,699
produce product managers could see the

220
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:06,980
most up-to-date version and we roll it

221
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,619
out to Airbnb employees all across the

222
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:11,629
world in Seoul and Beijing a new delhi

223
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:14,300
and it was really incredibly effective

224
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,429
for us because anybody in any team could

225
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:22,160
could go to the normal page and just

226
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,379
scroll down to the bottom and click a

227
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:27,470
button and see and see what it would

228
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,470
look like on the day of the launch

229
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,329
here's an example of our product called

230
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,990
meetups which is up allows you to RSVP

231
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,639
to meetups organized around the world

232
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,230
another example would be a wish list

233
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,589
which is like Pinterest for Airbnb just

234
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:47,329
one click you can preview what I would

235
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:50,410
look like on the day of the rebrand and

236
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,309
just and following up on the idea of the

237
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:57,319
different or two versions basically the

238
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,420
secret sauce is that we would check if

239
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,179
the user was an admin and if they had on

240
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,399
they were requesting the rebranded

241
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,139
version and just serve up a different or

242
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:08,809
new package for that actually this is a

243
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,579
big simplification because we had to do

244
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:12,290
some other technical challenges like

245
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,439
caching making sure that our secret rear

246
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,689
ended early but basically those idea

247
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:21,439
behind it in this concept of having this

248
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:24,019
single button to test really important

249
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,879
to give getting really quick feedback as

250
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:29,540
changes were made to the system for

251
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,329
instance that what the designers wanted

252
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:35,269
they wanted to UM change the design of

253
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:37,819
have so what we did was we made a change

254
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:40,819
to o'toole we wrote it out airbnb com

255
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,220
and then the designer could could see

256
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,499
what it look like across the site but by

257
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:49,999
just clicking that button and this quick

258
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:51,769
iteration cycle a lot of catch some

259
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:53,899
really interesting box or some really

260
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:57,019
bad CSS box if you rewrite like a few

261
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,339
thousand signs of CSS you're going to

262
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,949
break something but you can't break

263
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:02,929
something come talk to me so they can

264
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:07,480
hire you for every and be so anyway the

265
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,669
bug that we caught was that when their

266
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:12,470
designer notice that a red links and

267
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,079
alerts so kind of ugly so they asked can

268
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:17,929
you make it them white so typical

269
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:19,790
engineer say is very easy I just write

270
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,970
some code so here's a sample code that

271
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,249
that one might that you might write to

272
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:27,980
UM to make those to make links within

273
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,089
alerts white white and underlying so I

274
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:33,559
just wanted to take a few moments to

275
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,540
look at it and see if you guys can guess

276
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,419
what the unintended side effects is kim

277
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:42,649
hill is about element selectors so

278
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,209
basically what happened was that when he

279
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:47,209
had anchor tags in in buttons it would

280
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,730
overwrite that behavior because it had a

281
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,559
bigger specificity than the normal

282
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,529
button selector and therefore buttons

283
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,439
over the site look like this can you

284
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,149
imagine what would have happened if this

285
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,639
had gone on launch day i probably

286
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,929
wouldn't be here talking to you guys so

287
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,790
that that's one that there was a great

288
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,559
thing about this allow us to iron out

289
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,699
along the box as we went along and then

290
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,230
the third thing I want to talk about is

291
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,649
scaling the rebrand so for most of you

292
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:20,329
guys who have used Airbnb you probably

293
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:21,980
think of every video comments a really

294
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,429
simple website just booking and hosting

295
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,189
like maybe hosts need to respond to

296
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:29,749
messages and I know that's about it how

297
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:31,490
many pages can then be is about five

298
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,169
right well as I found out reduce project

299
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:38,419
airbnb.com comprises of booking and

300
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,970
hosting and basically like a ton of

301
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:47,509
other products and so our approach was

302
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:50,449
to the promise that we made to

303
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:52,429
engineering so say if you got your pages

304
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,690
on 202 that you gain instant

305
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,000
rebrand and this look really well for a

306
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,240
bunch of all different pages like

307
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,110
meetups meetups was by Otto finding it

308
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,900
those it just into the rebrand landing

309
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,390
pages we got it 202 in an instant

310
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,030
rebrand Disaster Response a product that

311
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,030
allows host volunteer to host the

312
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:19,470
refugees and wish list and and I worked

313
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,440
really well for us but after sit but

314
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,810
then we come to this some parts of the

315
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,810
system which is legacy code so the

316
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,910
dashboards if you guys have ever used a

317
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,740
dashboard the main idea behind it is to

318
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,110
consolidate all the key features that a

319
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,630
user might one into one place so that

320
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,450
they can easily access it and that's a

321
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,580
really good idea in principle what

322
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,380
usually happens in the real world is

323
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,780
that more and more features just get

324
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,720
sucked into this dashboard and it just

325
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,290
gets so complicated and for Airbnb while

326
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,990
Dad was look like was first get a

327
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,120
dashboard then me and all the user

328
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,880
settings things like connecting your

329
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,460
facebook your facebook account and then

330
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,300
we had random authentication stuff like

331
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,840
connecting your two factor

332
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,270
authentication and then we had advanced

333
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,250
calendar views you guys have probably

334
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,230
never seen this but apparently our host

335
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,030
care a lot about this because it allows

336
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,950
them to see their listing visibility

337
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,180
across different properties editing your

338
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,860
profile important calendars basically

339
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,780
everything under the sun is in within

340
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,660
this single dashboard products and so

341
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,190
when we looked at this product and and

342
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,390
try to think about what we could do

343
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,460
about it we were asking ourselves the

344
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,930
question can we even snap this 2020 so

345
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,610
for a lot of the old pages it was really

346
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,440
simple to just convert it over 20 to

347
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,080
because there's a single page and it was

348
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,020
very simple adapted but for dashboards

349
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,900
it was a lot more complex because it was

350
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,060
a monolithic set of features we couldn't

351
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,440
just change one page because then you

352
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,920
look

353
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,130
the others there was one of CSS

354
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,040
everywhere tons and tons of sprites and

355
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,260
stirred it was our teen and crafty code

356
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,810
because all the dashboard features

357
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,700
probably written ones like three years

358
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,529
ago and no one touch it again so we were

359
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:15,690
thinking about it so we talked about how

360
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,360
can we how can we rewrite this whole CSS

361
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,839
without going nuts and so we thought we

362
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,670
needed a more nuanced approach to it and

363
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,519
so we came up the idea of 14 dashboards

364
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,380
so what do I mean by 14 what we what we

365
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,060
did was we create a separate branch of

366
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,699
the entire dashboard application that

367
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:39,930
was using o2 and we relaunched it only

368
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,110
to admins so for every page within the

369
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,389
dashboard we would check if the user was

370
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:48,449
allowed to exit view the go-to version

371
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:52,290
if they were admin and in that case show

372
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,570
them the 02 version and if not show them

373
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,930
the whole shitty version and this is a

374
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,579
really complicated approach compared to

375
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,829
just updating it to odo but it was

376
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:03,600
really necessary because this is just

377
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,549
like so complicated and so big that

378
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,919
rewriting the CSS is just kind of

379
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,839
untenable and for all the property code

380
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,329
that we that that nobody really knew

381
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,370
about we try we engage different teams

382
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,350
to work on it so like for instance a

383
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,209
really complicated calendar page we will

384
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:23,699
ask the team that down host to look at

385
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,890
it because it would just be too scary to

386
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,500
touch and here's example of us using a

387
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,660
sauna to talk to the payment scheme and

388
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,370
ask them to help out for us and so over

389
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,660
a span of four weeks via 14th we pop we

390
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,059
 it in and did a first pass over

391
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,070
it in and did a first pass over
all the different pages and then we

392
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,540
spend another two weeks finding on a box

393
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,549
which is you guys probably know finding

394
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:52,500
boxes using pretty long process and the

395
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,030
third part was whiskey profit which is

396
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,940
not really a part but never mind

397
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,760
and so on after we we had snapped it 202

398
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,519
in and and then so here's what it looks

399
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,590
like after that nice and clean and we

400
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,870
deleted over thousands of lines of code

401
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:18,200
after merging the fork so the last thing

402
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,559
I want to talk about is is it's the

403
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,389
overall project what does it mean to be

404
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:25,850
successful as a rebrand so it's really

405
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,210
interesting because like for a lot of

406
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,620
projects you can see that the success of

407
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,059
our project is a fifty percent more

408
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:36,440
users all we have we have increase in so

409
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,480
and so metric but that's not really how

410
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,460
r e breads work the main purpose of a

411
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,760
rear end is to revise an existing brand

412
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,220
and make it feel fresh and new and I

413
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,809
think the biggest testament to that

414
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:49,760
would probably be this quote from

415
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,210
somebody from a designer actually saying

416
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,679
this is one of the best roles that I

417
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,690
have seen a long time there's a

418
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,309
long-term vision for the brand here that

419
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,260
we really started to take hold and like

420
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,789
to say over time this will be a very

421
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:04,010
recognizable icon on properties all over

422
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,370
the globe and it's especially impactful

423
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,179
because as a digital bread airbnb com

424
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,039
presence to the user is is our website

425
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,600
our guests and hosts me each other from

426
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,399
website and they spend lots of time

427
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:20,269
there and so and so the visual identity

428
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:23,409
of Airbnb is really tied to airbnb com

429
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:29,299
and so I after this horse protect we had

430
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:32,059
20 engineers working on this 500 plus

431
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:37,460
pull request 941 files captain over

432
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,820
10,000 lines of CSS leader and I think

433
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,549
one of the biggest things that biggest

434
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,960
things I liked about this project was

435
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,690
opportunity to get rid of all legacy CSS

436
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,549
and bring us into a fresh new world

437
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:52,669
where we can have river and a well

438
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:55,429
encapsulated CSS framework I used to be

439
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:56,899
really afraid of touching coat on

440
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:59,659
dashboards because basically to make any

441
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:00,240
changes

442
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,760
we need to trip either at an ID selector

443
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,059
or throw to the thousands of light of

444
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,420
CSS and being able to go to a featurette

445
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,610
just start writing CSS and not be afraid

446
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,780
of breaking things is such a wonderful

447
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:19,920
and freeing feeling and cell area and in

448
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,690
this whole project we managed to get

449
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,700
everything on o2 and for the first time

450
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,610
every page on airbnb com is implemented

451
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,740
using our own in-house UI and a

452
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,710
consistent de la design language and so

453
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,090
that's basically all I have for you to

454
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,240
share about the rear end you guys have

455
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,760
any questions hi my name is honest I am

456
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,640
a question you said you build up on the

457
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,070
Twitter bootstrap framework and you

458
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,280
picked your own stuff I don't know that

459
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,750
so how do you maintain that like you

460
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,420
have you been up on Twitter and if they

461
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,390
come up with a new version of bootstrap

462
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,550
do you put that changes in or you

463
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,620
maintain your own framework or like how

464
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,130
do you move on with that I guess it's

465
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,050
not really so much as from Twitter

466
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,550
bootstrap as inspired by Twitter

467
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,650
bootstrap because our set of elements is

468
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,150
actually quite different than Twitter

469
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,550
bootstrap tara has mucho más a lot more

470
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,020
component than us so we are basically

471
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,510
ours is like a inspiration rather than

472
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,830
or for it oh cool hi thanks for the

473
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,080
great talk I was just wondering if you

474
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,420
had any experience with or many

475
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,220
suggestions for what I made it ceases

476
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,750
testing like you my views on a build

477
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,100
server or a continuous integration

478
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,460
environment oh it's a continuous

479
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,800
integration solution for CSS yeah like

480
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,390
what a mega because it seems like the

481
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,059
pattern it's more menu or human based

482
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,630
testing but something to be kissed by a

483
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,030
computer yeah so that's actually a

484
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,710
really interesting question because like

485
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,540
I use I used to do a lot more real

486
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,520
engineering and like in the case you can

487
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,170
write spectable what it looks like and

488
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,850
unfortunately that doesn't really exist

489
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,490
for CSS your build tools that allow you

490
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,160
to compare screenshots before and after

491
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,590
using an integration of capybara I

492
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,390
believe what we haven't really tried

493
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,030
using it because for us one of the

494
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,309
biggest things is just manually testing

495
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,290
across the set of browsers we support

496
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,780
which is quite extensive like including

497
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,030
supporting ie8 so sorry I can't really

498
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,309
recommend a good solution there if

499
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:28,860
anyone else has any ideas for your chime

500
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:34,890
in hello what if I say that you change

501
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,890
from the old you I to the new 22 a new

502
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,309
point and if I if when you are trended

503
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:43,470
you are registering a plan and develop

504
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,380
are adding new features how do you

505
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,190
handle it

506
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,160
I mean you need to do something in old

507
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,520
UI and so for the bout majority of the

508
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,690
side we simply dropped in a different

509
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,850
I'm CSS framework so it was up to the

510
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,150
developer to check that with the new CSS

511
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,490
that it look good but for dashboards

512
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,350
because we it we actually had to

513
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,900
a tell everyone that you have to add

514
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,950
your features to both and and designer

515
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,590
debt and mine which was which was not

516
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,870
easy by was the only way to do it ok

517
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,020
thank you right big engine Fiona thank
