00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,379

okay hi everyone um doesn't help that

2
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:19,320
the the talk in front of me was called

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,939
how did you how you can teach JavaScript

4
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,560
because today I'm actually gonna talk

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,380
about JavaScript I thought I was gonna

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,929
talk at J's cough but unfortunately I

7
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,470
got put on CSS cause I know for a fact

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,720
that you can do 3d on the web with CSS

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,520
but that's not something that I'm gonna

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,010
talk about today so apologize for those

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,719
who has that idea so about me my name is

12
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:46,000
Sheila I am a developer advocate and all

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
the desk so all of this is a 3d computer

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,170
software company if you guys don't know

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,300
so basically we have built a lot of

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,390
products around 3d and also in the

17
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,760
browser so I was I just wanted to show

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,420
you guys this today so I'm gonna go

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,080
through a very simple and very small

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,670
example for for writing 3d on the web

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,450
and it's basically gonna resemble this

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,030
I'm gonna only take you through from

23
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,140
step 1 through 4 here and from step 4 to

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,439
5 really requires a lot of study and

25
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,340
I'll show you what I exactly mean later

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,350
so basically it's really on the web is

27
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,140
WebGL and WebGL 101 it's based on a

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,790
WebGL is based on something called open

29
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,460
to you yes it's not the same thing but

30
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,130
it's a very similar syntax if you guys

31
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,439
have any experience it's meant for the

32
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,060
browser's and it's very very difficult

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,719
and I'm gonna show you guys exactly what

34
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,000
it is here is a very simple simple

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,490
sample code of drawing one triangle with

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,610
WebGL it's about 100 lines of code and

37
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:09,550
you get a triangle like this so if this

38
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,230
is geo programming so it's basically

39
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,500
calling API an API and draws from the

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,010
GPU

41
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,880
so if you

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,410
doing very graphics heavy stuff on the

43
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,920
browser this is what you want to use and

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,770
luckily there are a lot of ways to

45
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,020
simplify this there's a lot of existing

46
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,920
libraries and frameworks that lets you

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,110
do this so today I'm just gonna talk

48
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,440
about something that is very versatile

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,970
an easier way of 3d on the web so there

50
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,170
are a lot of different libraries to

51
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,090
choose from there's like three J's Babel

52
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,610
and J has a frame it sometimes someone

53
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,930
from Mozilla is gonna talk about a

54
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,310
frames I don't like too thick and steal

55
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,920
their thunder there are game engines

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,860
like unity that exports to WebGL but

57
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,020
it's very it's for very very specific

58
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,030
use cases so I'm just gonna talk about

59
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,350
something that's very versatile right

60
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,290
here which is three gears and this is a

61
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,680
link to say so three kids basically

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,050
abstract away in triangles in GL

63
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,510
programming instead of doing all that

64
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,480
like this is these three lines are doing

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,060
more stuff than what that hundred lines

66
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,790
did back there so in to draw a cylinder

67
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,270
in 3d space you basically specify a

68
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,490
number of triangles that makes up a

69
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,520
cylinder instead of writing all those

70
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,910
triangles by yourself with vertices you

71
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,990
could just vark cylinder equals new 3d

72
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:43,570
mesh and new cylinder geometry so if you

73
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,250
want to draw a square it's like a score

74
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,910
square of geometry so to get started

75
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,760
with three j/s there are four things

76
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,260
that you need you need asking a scene

77
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,709
camera renderer and your control and you

78
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,350
want to fill stuff in your scene and you

79
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,510
want to animate the scene so that's like

80
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,510
very basic 3d scene things that you need

81
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,650
so here I'm gonna talk about three

82
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,450
functions so the innate function is

83
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,280
gonna init initialize the scene camera

84
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,410
renderer and controls the field ceiling

85
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,970
thing is gonna put stuff in the scene

86
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,420
and then I'm gonna animate it it should

87
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,180
be quite straightforward so in three.js

88
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,650
when you initialize the scene there's a

89
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,750
news and three scene and

90
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,480
you get a camera which is a which I'm

91
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,610
gonna use a perspective camera here is a

92
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,990
very very commonly used 3d camera as

93
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,510
opposed to orthographic camera which is

94
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,000
like viewing 2d on 3d but we don't have

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,360
to go to go into deep here you passing a

96
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,400
bunch of variables basically the inner

97
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,980
clipping form complained outer clipping

98
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,710
pointing and how big you want you want

99
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,970
your camera to view and then you passing

100
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,950
the review you instantiate the renderer

101
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,070
and set the color of the renderer and

102
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,910
the size and then for the control here

103
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,340
I'm using again a very generic 3d

104
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,690
control that that is commonly used in 3d

105
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,970
scenes and they in the end you just use

106
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,590
your renderer to render your scene and

107
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,640
camera so in the beginning after you

108
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,230
initialize everything it's very it's

109
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,990
it's just a scene it's it's not special

110
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,140
at all right now so the next step what I

111
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,880
did is you fill seeing basically I've

112
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,000
instantiated a bunch of particles all in

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,580
all with the 3js material and this is

114
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,020
very very basic 3d mesh and it's a

115
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,350
particle it's it's the particle geometry

116
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,360
and particle material is you know

117
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,950
basically what you want to passing as

118
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,490
parameters and I said I randomized the

119
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,710
positions and randomized the directions

120
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,290
I want to take because I want to animate

121
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,620
those particles and I add that particles

122
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,580
into the scene so I have a randomized

123
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,400
set of particles in the 3d space we

124
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,170
can't really do anything right now yet

125
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,210
it's still nothing special it's it

126
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,470
doesn't move but we're getting there so

127
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,110
the last thing I want to do is the enemy

128
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,580
animating is less of a actual animating

129
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,530
you want to consider it less as

130
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,780
animating the objects but more to tell

131
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,880
the browser what to do each time it

132
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,310
calls request animation frame so request

133
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,570
animation frame there's something that

134
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,640
you know whenever the browser refreshes

135
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,590
the frame you

136
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,840
it will call the function within

137
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,720
requestanimationframe so in computer

138
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,700
vendor animation it needs to be 60

139
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,170
frames per second and that's exactly

140
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,050
what requests and information frame does

141
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,400
with a lot of graphics programmers they

142
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,770
like still use this at timeout which is

143
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,380
something that I really so basically the

144
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,900
in my code I'm gonna call animate in the

145
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,610
request animation frame function so

146
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,100
again I'm up

147
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,590
I added my control so I I'm updating my

148
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,980
controls and I run a four loop through

149
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,270
each of the particles and I move the

150
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,420
particles every time the the

151
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,760
requestanimationframe is called and then

152
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,270
I also said a boundary where if the

153
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,270
particle reaches an edge it bounces back

154
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,340
so it's still very simple code and I

155
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:42,670
render it again each time I enemy so

156
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,160
here it's moving very slowly and this is

157
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,590
a 3d scene so I can use orbit controls

158
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,080
so yeah this is still very very basic so

159
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,450
this is a source code and if you want to

160
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,850
get a VR like effect you basically

161
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,850
replace the camera the some of the

162
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,400
parameters in the camera and replace the

163
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,930
control with something called device

164
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,560
orientation controls so basically that

165
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,050
hooks up your camera your your phone or

166
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,120
or VR device orientation with with the

167
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,760
scene so here's the demo if you guys

168
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,220
have cured ghosts and sienar I encourage

169
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,690
you to try it I'm just gonna give you

170
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:33,300
guys a minute

171
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,430
it's basically goes to a website that I

172
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:49,330
built for this

173
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,920
so if you have a phone that you

174
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,270
purchased after 2014

175
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,120
you should have 3d enabled and be able

176
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,760
to see it rendered with the devices okay

177
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,740
so everyone got it so again this is step

178
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,620
four to really make really cool

179
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,089
animations in the in a 3d space I'm

180
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,160
gonna show you guys what we've done and

181
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,880
and this may be some inspiration of what

182
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,910
you could really do with three days so

183
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,950
so this is the library that we've both

184
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,520
on top of three years with this is like

185
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,970
a computer-aided design model and and I

186
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,760
mean the browser so you can look at how

187
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,430
just how good the rendering is and the

188
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,490
materials are so you can zoom into each

189
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:57,950
of the particle where the and basically

190
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,770
look at these engineering drawings and

191
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,089
this was built with a with a industrial

192
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:07,250
design this model was strong with the

193
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,820
industrial design software so everything

194
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,740
that was in the was in the design

195
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,730
actually got ported into the browser and

196
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,640
and it's the library behind it is three

197
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,990
years and that's why I'm talking about

198
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,730
it today so with this you can basically

199
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,670
where we have tied a bunch of JavaScript

200
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,550
functions with this everything is

201
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,070
basically a JavaScript object so we have

202
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,709
typed a lot of JavaScript functions so

203
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,490
you can do like expo fold or rotate and

204
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,170
this what this basically is doing is

205
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,270
doing a transferring transformation to

206
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:51,130
your to the object in your 3d scene and

207
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,500
it's just very significant how far we've

208
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,680
gotten to to render 3d and in the

209
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,690
website because in a website because

210
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,020
this we have not done any optim

211
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,980
optimization to render this because we

212
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,730
what we what we do as a company is we do

213
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,770
imaging engineering data so none of

214
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,750
these data can be lost and we do no

215
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,480
optimization to the number of Polly's

216
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,700
like we don't we don't reduce the number

217
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:28,400
of Polly's in in this drawing so so

218
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,120
there's a bunch of demos we have also

219
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,020
like both a lot of functions with these

220
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,280
type of 3d models you could you could

221
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,710
again like expose exploded or you could

222
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:53,590
do a sectioning

223
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,120
like you can section this whatever model

224
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,950
3d model you have so sometimes I would

225
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,530
hear people that have touched that

226
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,720
front-end developers that have touched a

227
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,790
little bit on WebGL and said that WebGL

228
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,890
isn't really promising this is like a

229
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:18,230
proof against that and because this is

230
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,290
again engineering data you have like all

231
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:27,040
the properties and and all the all the

232
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:34,150
statistics on on each of the part and

233
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,610
there there's just another thing I

234
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,920
wanted to show you guys what we've both

235
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,160
this is project Apollo and we basically

236
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,990
collaborated with it with the university

237
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:56,780
and putting the model of the stem space

238
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,830
space capsule and and showed it to the

239
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,440
public and and you can click on their

240
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,230
link and look at everything and honestly

241
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,260
this is really best achieved with WebGL

242
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,270
you can't really do it with anything any

243
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:16,010
other technology and let's see I just

244
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,780
want to finish off with this beautiful

245
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,030
rendering and that's what also one of

246
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,580
the things that people said about WebGL

247
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,030
is it doesn't have as much textures as

248
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,690
OpenGL however you can really write very

249
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,560
very beautiful rendering and graphics in

250
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,760
the browser okay that's it all my talk

251
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,000
and this is a QR code for the slides if

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,180
you guys want to check it out

253
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:54,489
