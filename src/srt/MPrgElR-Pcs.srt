00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,280

I'm going to be talking about Orion

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,700
which is not an online IDE it's

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,290
different but you'll you'll see that if

4
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,410
you're curious right now you can just go

5
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,619
to that URL it's eclipse.org / Orion and

6
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:33,590
you can sign up and play with it if

7
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,400
you're bored by my talking because I'm

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,699
going to just start with this a few

9
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:45,430
things that don't actually demo Rhine

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,110
because I want to make a kind of bigger

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,729
point here so um ok my name is Boris

12
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,920
Michalski should probably say I'm an

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,960
eclipse guy so I have this Java

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,850
background I'm transitioning to

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,559
JavaScript learning a lot it's a lot of

16
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,659
fun and but really originally I'm a

17
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:11,810
small talk dude so anyway so to start

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,729
off first some authorizations

19
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:16,880
observations as software developers who

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,400
are one of the few professions that can

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,120
actually build our own tools and we

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,160
enjoy doing that so it's like a

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,100
carpenter might build out Jake or

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,160
something that helps him get his work

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,500
done faster we do the same kind of thing

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,410
and we we enjoy doing tools and software

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,070
development as it started was stuff on

28
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,360
the command line and it got really

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,790
powerful so you can do funny things and

30
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,500
the command line is really nice because

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,890
you can add new tools and all these

32
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,260
little tools that you can build yourself

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,530
or get from others are integrated by

34
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,390
accessing the file system or using those

35
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,990
pipes and filters and their scripting

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,599
but distribution is a bit of a problem

37
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,870
because if you've written something in

38
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,790
some language that and you want to give

39
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,379
it to somebody else they have to have

40
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,769
the same kind of environment they maybe

41
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:27,280
have to recompile that stuff so

42
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,060
but it's it's a nice way to to develop

43
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,709
software you have all these tools and

44
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:34,980
you can add whatever you want so there's

45
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,280
a another way of working of doing

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,350
software developing that's those big

47
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,739
IDEs this is the one that I've been

48
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,860
working on for a couple years and I the

49
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,489
ease give you deeper integration so for

50
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,520
example in Eclipse you get not only the

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,860
file system but you get change events as

52
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,530
an eclipse plugin there's integration in

53
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,000
terms of the errors and warnings all

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,790
appearing in one place there's a certain

55
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,130
level of you I consistency it's a UI

56
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,440
level tool not a command line tool those

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,920
kinds of things but it's pretty

58
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,730
difficult to write plugins or two right

59
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,590
tools that run in this environment and

60
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,069
get this kind of deep integration and

61
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:22,230
the distribution problem is not solved

62
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,970
at all you have to package up your stuff

63
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,170
you have to give it to somebody else

64
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,120
they have to find the place in eclipse

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,420
where you add a plug-in all those kinds

66
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,709
of things so my claim now is with the

67
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,200
web we have a third alternative of doing

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,299
things and and why is that well

69
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,200
obviously our software developers we

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,579
spend a lot of time in browsers

71
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,209
especially web developers but but

72
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,010
everybody basically is doing

73
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,260
backtracking planning tracking bills may

74
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,420
be browsing documentation in the browser

75
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,180
already and then there's tools like

76
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,470
cloud 9i te and Orion that address the

77
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,600
core development activities like editing

78
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,519
code navigating files and folders

79
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,190
running unit tests debugging those kinds

80
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,950
of things and then there are lots of

81
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,780
little tools and what do I mean with

82
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,239
lots of little tools I mean these kinds

83
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,280
of things where it's really easy for

84
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,979
somebody to just make a tool available

85
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,640
out out there on the web and when I say

86
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,440
a lot of little tools I really mean a

87
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,710
lot of little tools so i spent 23 hours

88
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,620
just googling for web-based tool various

89
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,169
flavors and these are some of the things

90
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:38,270
that I found

91
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,040
so there's stuff for CSS and rounded

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,180
corners build related things picking

93
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,870
colors coming up with a scaffolding for

94
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,120
website sharing code snippets

95
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,130
understanding regular expressions doing

96
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:02,060
what requests for formatting code and

97
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,220
it's amazing the amount of innovation

98
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:14,970
that's out there is amazing

99
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,850
and it's a lot I don't know so um how

100
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,130
many of you have built such a tool and

101
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,970
put it online somewhere only one can't

102
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,490
believe it how do you end up with these

103
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,220
many tools so i think the web is

104
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,690
becoming a platform for software

105
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,100
development tools because all these

106
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,770
things are part of the software

107
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,510
development workflow and it's really

108
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,460
easy to add those tools and you just get

109
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,100
to them by urls and the distribution

110
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,810
problem is solved as long as those

111
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,300
things run in all the browsers and the

112
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,520
big open problem is integration how do

113
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,560
these tools work together how how can

114
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,870
you ensure that as you transition from

115
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,970
one tool to another that you don't have

116
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,330
to download or upload stuff into one

117
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,490
tool download results and then upload

118
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,290
into the next tool and so on and so

119
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,840
forth and this is what Ryan is about

120
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,170
it's about figuring out how we can make

121
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:17,500
those tools work together so and now

122
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:24,070
it's demo time

123
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,629
so all this was running from within

124
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:29,270
Orion so it's um was a little bit risky

125
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,710
or it's still risky running this from an

126
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,270
external site this is the orion editor

127
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,009
and there's the the rhine navigator and

128
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:48,259
let me close this to make it probably

129
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,970
hide

130
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,000
ok so I'll navigators so it's basically

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,580
files and folders and you can get to the

132
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,150
root by clicking here and then you get

133
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,460
get into things and all these things are

134
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,830
links and there are links because then

135
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,920
what we get is all the browser gestures

136
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,350
for doing things that browsers are good

137
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,210
at for example open stuff in new tabs

138
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,990
and by doing this I I was able to open a

139
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,320
second instance of that navigator on a

140
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,950
seven-second browser tab so um that's

141
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,110
what I mean by this is not an IDE it's

142
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,930
not putting and not translating the IDE

143
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:36,450
concepts that we like I've worked on for

144
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,060
the past couple years into a web app

145
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,880
that's on one tab but instead using the

146
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,070
web itself as the platform and then if

147
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,230
these various places that you go to for

148
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,820
example the navigator and the editor I

149
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,740
know you go here and that replaces the

150
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,430
navigator with the editor code and by

151
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,720
doing that you can ensure that as the

152
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,500
functionality grows as you add more

153
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,050
stuff to this you add more stuff by

154
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,450
adding more pages or new pages to it and

155
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:27,629
you don't get the load problems

156
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,409
airplane mode okay yeah sorry about that

157
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:38,409
I need my notes so um and but the editor

158
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,240
itself so it's it's a standalone thing

159
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,719
on this page and if i go back i get back

160
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,230
to the navigator mm-hmm so all those

161
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,079
navigation things work let me just get

162
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:52,510
to a place where there's a little bit of

163
00:08:52,510 --> 00:09:01,710
JavaScript

164
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,529
so for example here so there's the usual

165
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,800
things work in the editor that I don't

166
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,310
know commenting out a block of code

167
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,129
giving stuff up and down undo redo copy

168
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:18,730
paste all those things and it's it's

169
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,310
really fast like ace so not a problem

170
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,259
getting too I don't know over 100,000

171
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:27,790
lines of code and you can still type

172
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,589
down here and you get the syntax

173
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:32,740
highlighting and doesn't work only at

174
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,699
the bottom you can go to the top two if

175
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,459
you try to reload you get the the prompt

176
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:42,689
and yes I do want to go back there

177
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:46,470
support for error um checking and

178
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,579
displaying errors and there's nothing in

179
00:09:48,579 --> 00:10:01,830
here okay let's do something bad

180
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,280
so if it was somewhere else I could

181
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,200
still see there's an error up here that

182
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,270
moves me up there I can hover over that

183
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,400
and get the wonderful jslint error

184
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,070
message so as you can see this is not

185
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,470
something where we have invested all of

186
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,690
effort into making those error message

187
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,240
is really good it's more that we think

188
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,860
our focus needs to be on making those

189
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,680
integrations and the basic

190
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,060
infrastructure available and to that end

191
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,590
we make things like the ruler work and

192
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,250
have plug points where people can add

193
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,770
tools or we can add tools like jslint to

194
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:51,010
this story there's also a well that's

195
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,800
not very helpful but it's a place where

196
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,330
you can jump between different places in

197
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,200
the code and this information is also

198
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:12,220
coming from jay is lint okay so i said

199
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,050
it's about integration how how do you

200
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,400
make those tools work really well

201
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,850
together and you could always go to jays

202
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,280
lynch right you could go on to the

203
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,240
jslint on page and you could copy paste

204
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,980
your code in here but things like that

205
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,770
you want to pull into your editor

206
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,810
environment and make available there and

207
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,680
that's what we've done so we have this

208
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,890
the jslint code coming here as a

209
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,680
so-called plugin so a plugin is

210
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,050
something that we run on the page and

211
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,480
it's a hidden i frame and then we talk

212
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,690
to that thing using windows window post

213
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,800
message and in the example of the error

214
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,410
checking we give it the current editor

215
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,150
buffer and it comes back with a list of

216
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,760
problems so that could be jslint or it

217
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,260
could be jeaious hint or it could be

218
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:08,020
something entirely different what this

219
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,560
also enables is as I because it's an

220
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,870
iframe that we talk to we can make

221
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,550
things

222
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,410
we can enable things where the code that

223
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,720
gets added is actually coming from a

224
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,620
different domain so for example if i

225
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,230
went to something that was minified code

226
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,110
and wanted to to have that formatted i

227
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,060
could either copy paste this code into

228
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,510
some other web site like I don't know

229
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,130
Jay is beautified or org is one

230
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,910
possibility but again that's something

231
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,220
that doesn't really flow well so what

232
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,070
we've done is we've built something

233
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,220
which essentially is the JS beautify org

234
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,670
code plus a few lines of blue stuff that

235
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,620
talks that window post message for the

236
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,960
call to the Orion editor and I can go

237
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,690
and take this URL and install it into

238
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,730
Orion so that installs that plugin for

239
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:22,880
my account and installing that thing

240
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,930
will run lotus called once and cash

241
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,140
metadata about it like the the name of

242
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,990
that thing and an image and then next

243
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,320
time I come to an editor which should be

244
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,200
somewhere here okay so this was the

245
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,750
place where I wanted to format and now I

246
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,390
got this new action here which is

247
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,570
formatting my JavaScript and if I click

248
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,670
that at that point we load the iframe

249
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,020
and apparently it's kind of slow stop

250
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,779
using the Internet okay so loads the

251
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,760
iframe and then sends over the editor

252
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,089
buffer to that code it formatted in that

253
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,459
hidden iframe sends back a new buffer

254
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:11,180
and the same kind of idea is behind the

255
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,200
navigator so um yeah like this page so

256
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,610
in the navigator for example we're

257
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,150
currently browsing files on the Orion

258
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,940
server but this is pluggable and we

259
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,709
could be talking to some other server

260
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,360
that maybe speaks a different protocol

261
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,720
like

262
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,329
dev and display that in the Orion

263
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:42,259
navigator hmm ok how how have I run this

264
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,750
demo here this is this was basically I

265
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,430
went and forked on github actually this

266
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,250
is the the Orion clan code is up on

267
00:14:52,250 --> 00:15:03,199
github too so you can take this URL or a

268
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,560
read only thing and and in Ryan clone

269
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,319
that so we have a good support there and

270
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:12,500
that gave me this this directory J is

271
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,439
conf and then I can go and see what have

272
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:18,550
I changed so we have a little bit of get

273
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,649
you i implement it already so there's

274
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:24,769
things like my local changes i can see

275
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:30,170
the diff here I can if I want show that

276
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,589
in side-by-side this is something that

277
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:38,629
the eclipse guys um wanted to see here

278
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:41,089
where you have the old and new side by

279
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:45,259
side you can go back to the git status

280
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,839
page and you can leave that open as a

281
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
new tab and then whenever you go

282
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,800
somewhere else and you make a change you

283
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,139
go on the get status tab again hit

284
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:56,750
reload and you would get a new result of

285
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,730
of running gift status essentially and

286
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,180
from here you can say stage this stage

287
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:12,140
that enter a commit message

288
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,670
okay I think I've run through most of

289
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,020
the features of Orion and maybe another

290
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,270
point that I should make is that there

291
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,640
is a server that implements this and

292
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,790
because we're we used to be Java guys we

293
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,440
implement that server in Java but

294
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,540
there's nothing in the concept behind a

295
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,190
line that says it has to be one server

296
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:39,220
so for example this this full-text

297
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,950
search feature here is implemented using

298
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,300
solar and leucine oh no matches wanna

299
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,850
know maybe slide okay lots of matches

300
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,270
this is running in one Java VM right now

301
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,400
on the server side but it could well be

302
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,440
a different server that just calls my

303
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,960
resources calls my files and folders if

304
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,760
I have given access to that other server

305
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,000
so we've architected our servers such

306
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,560
that these things can be separated and

307
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,910
others can come along and say we have

308
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,770
much better code search so maybe the

309
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,280
google code search could crawl your

310
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,130
stuff and then make that and then plug

311
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,740
their functionality into with the plugin

312
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,209
mechanism into this search box up here

313
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:32,920
or there's a way to to basically launch

314
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,230
or make your your content available on

315
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,900
the web so that's similar to what cloud

316
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,380
nine is doing to and this is the URL

317
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,760
that my slides were on no it's not in

318
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,670
XHTML anyway making that available on

319
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,910
the web like that makes it possible to

320
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,740
go to other tools that are out there on

321
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,860
the web where you can just put that URL

322
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,200
in and then Google PageSpeed online

323
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,480
analyzes your stuff and gives you

324
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,320
results gives you hints for how to speed

325
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,750
up things so we're looking for those

326
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,230
kinds of things where there's other

327
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,210
tools they're out there already and how

328
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,650
can we make those part of your

329
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,020
development flow without everybody

330
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,720
having to write to a particular

331
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:27,640
api and with that i'm just going to give

332
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,400
you a few more links here the client

333
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,870
side of Orion has recently been

334
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,270
relicense and it's bsd license now and

335
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,440
the server side is EPL licensed and if

336
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,880
you want to find out more i would

337
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,419
suggest you go to that first URL there

338
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:46,780
any questions yes do we have local

339
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,669
history know right now we don't I would

340
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,380
like to implement something like that

341
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,210
but I would like it be part of the gate

342
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,610
support or you just have a micro branch

343
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,409
that's generated for you automatically

344
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:09,110
that shouldn't be too hard anything else

345
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,559
okay if you have other questions or wood

346
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,600
or have a tool that you think would be

347
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,210
interesting to integrate with this talk

348
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,299
to me and i'll be there snack i think

349
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:22,510
upstairs now and i'll walk there and if

350
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,159
you want to grab me that'd be awesome
