00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:11,709

[Music]

2
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:14,549
yeah hello I'm glad you're interested in

3
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,600
that weird topic my name is Anna I like

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,400
to talk about computer games

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,350
role-playing games and theoretical

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,170
computer science so just one topic was

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,090
fitting for the conference so I went

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,400
with theoretical computer science I'm

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,980
here today to talk to you about one of

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,930
my secret passions which is complexity

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,630
theory and I'm going to give you a short

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,670
introduction to computational complexity

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,160
so I'm not going to talk about time or

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,200
space complexity if you already have an

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,230
idea what this is I will use a very

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,660
made-up real-world example to help you

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,950
understand what I'm talking about

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,270
so let's go picture this for a moment

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,250
you are volunteering at an animal

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,579
shelter the shelter has cats dogs

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,899
turtles you and your weird manager the

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,020
manager is weird because she sets up

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,049
arbitrary rules for you and other people

24
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,479
to follow you are in charge of the

25
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,640
petting process over viewing the petting

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,439
process so visitors come to your shelter

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,259
and want to have pet animals and you

28
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,640
have to make sure they follow the

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,820
petting rules

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,119
each rule is different every day so on

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,100
your first day the rule is the visitors

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,189
cannot pet two cats or two dogs in a row

33
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,290
they're not allowed to touch the turtles

34
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,320
just for completion but this is through

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,140
so visitors come in may go pet the

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,479
animals they come to you and say well I

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,780
pet it a cat a dog a cat and a cat and

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,939
you have to decide for example if there

39
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,860
was a valid petting sequence or not if

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,840
they're good visitors or bad visitors

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,899
you know stuff you have to do you're an

42
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,070
engineering you're just volunteering

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,810
there so after 20 visitors you think

44
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,750
like ah a machine could do this and so

45
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,530
you build one you start thinking about

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,430
the process so

47
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,920
the visitor comes in and wants to pet an

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,469
animal and they can either decide to pet

49
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:21,010
a cat or a dog

50
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,569
if after petting a cat

51
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,359
they pet another kid there are the bad

52
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:27,769
visitors and I'm not allowed to come

53
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:29,840
back same with the dog petting a dog

54
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,459
after dog but they're good if they pet

55
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,870
another animal this is a very simple

56
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,299
machine that can handle your daily tasks

57
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:44,840
to see if the visitors alternate in

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,639
petting animals this machine has a name

59
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,439
in theoretical computer science at the

60
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,599
computer science it's called finite

61
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,760
state automaton so the pictures were the

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,980
hand and the animals are so-called

63
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,620
States the arrows between them are

64
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,030
so-called transitions between those

65
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,120
states this is a very simplified version

66
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,310
of what that is so if you never seen

67
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,040
anything like this because you don't

68
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,780
have a computer science education that's

69
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,190
basically the rough idea that you just

70
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,099
need to follow so you think you're good

71
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,840
and you're good for a couple of days but

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,709
then your manager changes the rule and

73
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:31,849
they say well the visitors first must

74
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,040
pet a specific number of cats and then

75
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,650
the same number of dogs

76
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,010
thank you again you sit there you want

77
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,259
to work but also you want to have time

78
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,909
to pet the animals yourself so you think

79
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:46,310
well maybe I can just adjust my machine

80
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,400
to do that work of checking the petting

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,430
sequences for me and you think about

82
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,729
that so you can start work petting

83
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:56,870
something if you pet a dog in the

84
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,049
beginning you're out that visitor but if

85
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,159
you pet a cat you can pet a lot of cats

86
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,340
and then you can switch to a dog and pet

87
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,879
a lot of dogs and if you're in the dog

88
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,959
stays if you cannot pet a cat again and

89
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,389
you think yeah that's that's nice fish I

90
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:20,780
mean I know now that I can only pet care

91
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,820
before dogs and not alternating between

92
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,270
them but it's not giving me a check for

93
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,090
whether I pet the same number of animals

94
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,660
and you think of it and think maybe the

95
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,610
machine I'm using is just not powerful

96
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,760
enough to handle this constraint that

97
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,690
the manager gave me so we're introducing

98
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,910
a new part to our machine and it's

99
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,120
called the stack the stack is really

100
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,330
like a stack of books you can put stuff

101
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,700
on top of it and you can put you can

102
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,180
take stuff from the top that's all it

103
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,010
can do so you cannot grab something from

104
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,380
the middle or from the bottom because it

105
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,020
will collapse and will not work I think

106
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,870
okay maybe that's already enough so we

107
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,700
go back to our machine which is not

108
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,780
working and we introduce the stack to it

109
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,270
so whenever we pet a cat we put a cat

110
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,479
token on the stack and whenever we put a

111
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,910
dog we remove a dog a cat token from the

112
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,040
sec so if this the cats and the dogs are

113
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,410
the same number the stack will be empty

114
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,300
in the end that we're good it was a good

115
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,350
visit or if there is a cat left it's bad

116
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,990
visitor if we want to take away a cat

117
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,270
and there's no cat there although we

118
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,550
have pet at a talk and it's also an

119
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,530
envelop petting sequence and the visitor

120
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,610
is a bad visitor this machine is called

121
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,350
a pushdown automaton so the push down is

122
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,750
just pushing stuff on the stack and the

123
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,490
stack is endless is like it's a deep

124
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,510
cellar with no end that doesn't matter

125
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,430
to you how deep it is it's just you can

126
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,470
use as much assist of you want if you as

127
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:10,010
much of it as you want remember that

128
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,570
this is just a theoretical models are

129
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,130
like no computers having infinite space

130
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,300
and again you're good for a couple of

131
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,229
days but then there's another rule the

132
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:23,870
rule change again changes again so again

133
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,760
we have to pet the same number of cats

134
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,729
as dogs but now introducing the Turtles

135
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,450
we weren't allowed to touch before and

136
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,830
then thinking again well how are we

137
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,660
going to

138
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,470
this with our stick you know it's now

139
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,630
not just two types of animals but three

140
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,000
so it just cannot take stuff from the

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,700
top and put stuff on the top we somehow

142
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,180
have to take into account the turtles

143
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,880
now so we need a new formalism a new

144
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,490
mechanism so we did just the stack and

145
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,440
introduced the tape a tape is the number

146
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,320
of cells and every cell can be accessed

147
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,630
and modified so in the beginning we have

148
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,220
the stack and we couldn't take stuff out

149
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,280
of the middle we can do this now we can

150
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,490
read each cell we can modify itself

151
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,590
the only restriction we have now saying

152
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,930
okay the lengths of the tape is just the

153
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,620
number of animals petted nothing more

154
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,380
that's it about these are the bounds

155
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,960
let's see if we can work with that

156
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,950
this tape is a so-called restricted tape

157
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,670
so our our input will again be in number

158
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,650
of family Mel's two cats two dogs two

159
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,580
turtles I spare you the state transition

160
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,640
diagram because it will get confusing

161
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,830
starting with this machine but the idea

162
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,860
is the following so whenever you see a

163
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,970
cat you walk on the tape until to the

164
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,640
right until you find a dog and then

165
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,400
until you find the turtle and then you

166
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,950
stop again go back to the beginning of

167
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,020
the tape and look for the first kid and

168
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,750
go on so if at the end of the cat's

169
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,620
their only access on the tape it's a

170
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,630
good visit or if there are any moles

171
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,669
left then it's not a good visitor

172
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:22,750
they're out this machine is called a

173
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,020
linear restricted Turing machine a

174
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,020
Turing machine is a linear restricted

175
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,510
Turing machine is the closest we can get

176
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,039
to a real computer because we have some

177
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,940
restrictions but a lot of power already

178
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,320
the Turing machine is named after Alan

179
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,229
Turing was a British meta machine met

180
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:47,260
the message math guy

181
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,800
he helped solve a crack the Enigma was

182
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,209
treated really bad by his government

183
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,540
unfortunately but he laid the basis for

184
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,510
the modern computer all this so that's

185
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,880
also white formal models are named after

186
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,320
him because they were basically his

187
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:10,790
ideas so now you'd a new rule and the

188
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,970
manager is not happy about the process

189
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,580
of retrospectively approving the padding

190
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,770
process she tells you know you have to

191
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,149
check beforehand now if they're going to

192
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,420
put nice on it but the rules simple you

193
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,860
know like you know what as long as they

194
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,990
stop petting after petting 2,000 animals

195
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,220
we're good you know okay weird manager

196
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,470
let's see yes but you know you have to

197
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,550
check beforehand if they're going to

198
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,930
stop at 2,000 animals so your day starts

199
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,230
like this

200
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,800
welcome to the animal shelter how are

201
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,890
you going to pet today the first visitor

202
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,070
says like I'm going to pay at 9999 cats

203
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,829
and one dog and you think about what you

204
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:53,750
do yes that sounds about right

205
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,839
just petting under 2,000 animals you're

206
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,899
good the next one comes like I'll pit

207
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,220
twice as many pets in this step then in

208
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,230
the step before and I'll start with one

209
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,839
cat and you're already thinking about

210
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,940
autumn izing this but now you cannot

211
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,640
just check sequences of petting but you

212
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,579
have to check you know descriptions of

213
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,120
petting processes and that can can get

214
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,399
really complicated and the programs are

215
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,230
not just like the the descriptions are

216
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,120
not limited in any way they can be

217
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,880
everything if you think well you have to

218
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,010
believe me that restrictor tape won't do

219
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,490
anymore

220
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,709
I might need more space I don't need I

221
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:38,120
don't know how many space I want it

222
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,060
maybe it's twice as much maybe it's a

223
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,610
lot of orders of magnitude higher than

224
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,209
that so we now go to infinity and beyond

225
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:50,209
and we introduce an unrestricted tape

226
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,670
and this is the point where it's really

227
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,310
just a mental model anymore

228
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,950
again we have a tape we have

229
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,740
read/write head where we can access and

230
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,250
modify every cell but our tape is

231
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,740
infinite has an infinite amount of sales

232
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,140
to both sides and we can do a lot with

233
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,750
it like really a lot there's beyond that

234
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,180
there's basically basically just I

235
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,120
cannot solve this problem anymore

236
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,510
type of problems some fur does a now

237
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,190
what's the German word it's like a big

238
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,200
hammer to solve your problems even if

239
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,750
you just have a tiny tiny nail and it's

240
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,020
called an unrestricted Turing machine

241
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,780
the description how you access the cells

242
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,570
is it's not super complicated but a bit

243
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,430
too much for that talk but you can ask

244
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,920
me about it later if you want so that

245
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,100
was the basic introduction of

246
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,330
computational complexity so let's recap

247
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,170
a bit during our process at the animal

248
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:54,530
shelter

249
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,500
I work there we build four machines in

250
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,470
our head mostly the first one was was

251
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,960
the finit stayed at someone won the

252
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,860
pushdown automaton the linear restricted

253
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,120
Turing machine and the unrestricted

254
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,410
Turing machine these types of machines

255
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,780
helped so-called help to solve so-called

256
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,330
decision problems for languages so what

257
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,860
is a decision problem in English it

258
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,260
would be decide whether an input is

259
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,150
valid against the given set of rules or

260
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,360
not it's still in English but like a

261
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,710
little more computer science he is

262
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,690
decide whether a word is part of a

263
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,280
language so if you if you don't have a

264
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,680
formal computer science education you

265
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,600
might wonder like what we what do you

266
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,040
mean by what is the language what is the

267
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,810
language I mean it speak English like

268
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,780
French and these are languages but in

269
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,940
computer science a language is just a

270
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,990
set of words the set can be fin it can

271
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:56,930
be infinite and some sets are described

272
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,540
by rules and some are not so some

273
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,880
languages would be for example every

274
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,680
sentence in the English language it's a

275
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,360
set of strings it's a set of words

276
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,770
others would be the set of all valid

277
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,000
phone numbers

278
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,010
the set of all polynomial in tin hello

279
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,870
world so you can see that some of the

280
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,960
sets are no they are all infinite as a

281
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,730
matter of fact but just you know the set

282
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,680
with the word hello is already a

283
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,640
language in a way and these machines

284
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,200
help us to classify those languages

285
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,160
there are formalisms

286
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,140
to help us understand how you know how

287
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,520
complex the language is in the

288
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,030
computational sense there are some names

289
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,130
for those languages for example the

290
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,000
first type of language we we set with a

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,070
finite state automaton it's called a

292
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,810
regular language so you might have heard

293
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,760
of regular expressions and they're like

294
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,330
really really deeply connected to that

295
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,760
the pushdown automata describe

296
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,730
context-free languages most of the human

297
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,410
languages are context-free languages and

298
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,310
can be computed with those machines the

299
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,650
next type of languages would be context

300
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,540
sensitive languages they are human

301
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,800
languages who fall into that category

302
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,070
and another one which you're probably

303
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,050
not going to touch anytime soon are

304
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,610
recursively enumerable languages there

305
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,140
are a lot of other words for those

306
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,080
groups but this is these are some of

307
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,410
them and if you want to look close into

308
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,490
that you just google for Chomsky

309
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:44,030
hierarchy Noam Chomsky was or is he used

310
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,040
to work as a linguist at least and he

311
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,980
laid the basis for a lot of formal

312
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,450
formal syntax and formal grammar and

313
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,790
it's a really interesting read because

314
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,230
it was one of the first people to look

315
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,020
at languages in a mathematical way and

316
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,480
they also laid the basis for this type

317
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,080
of theoretical computer science so now

318
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,640
you're wondering like why would I need

319
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,320
to know that and maybe you don't you

320
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,770
know if your job is just increasing

321
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,020
conversion by coloring buttons that's

322
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,130
totally fine and you're probably not

323
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,980
going to touch this part of of computer

324
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,740
science but it can be useful for

325
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,329
validation purposes

326
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:26,189
as I told you like a decision problem is

327
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:28,230
to see whether an input follows a

328
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,649
specific set of rules and phone number

329
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,629
validation or address validation you

330
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:36,329
might have touched this and now present

331
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:39,449
you would like to groups of problems at

332
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,910
this point so we have the set of valid

333
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,529
phone numbers and the valid street

334
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:47,040
addresses and in this second group we

335
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,649
has correctly matched parentheses and

336
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:53,939
valid SPG so why would you check for

337
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,309
correctly matched parentheses you

338
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:59,129
probably wouldn't but if you write a

339
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:01,639
text editor for programmers for example

340
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,839
that's an interesting thing to know like

341
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,879
do you inform your user that they're

342
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:11,850
missing prevent parenthesis and I told

343
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,249
you how regular languages are deeply

344
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:17,309
tied to regular expressions and for a

345
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,339
lot of problems and sets we have regular

346
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,739
expressions are totally fine but for the

347
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:25,939
second group they're not for example

348
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:28,230
because the second group the language is

349
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,629
in the second group are more complex

350
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:32,309
than the one in the first group and they

351
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:33,779
need a different type of machine a

352
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,879
different type of formalism to be

353
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,759
evaluated and checked against so you

354
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,369
can't really write any regular

355
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:43,919
expressions for SVG or HTML for example

356
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,049
because you have the opening and closing

357
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,209
parentheses now I know that there are

358
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:50,819
people here will probably say yeah but

359
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:53,790
there are regular expressions that you

360
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,199
can use to do that and in a way that

361
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,279
their implementations that make it

362
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,519
possible on a strictly theoretical base

363
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,139
it's not another thing that you might

364
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:10,439
leverage but that another knowledge that

365
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,699
you might leverage is the so-called

366
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,220
expressive power

367
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,659
so all formulations or machines have a

368
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:20,699
power of what they can describe and one

369
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,899
thing this hierarchy has is that the

370
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:27,329
machine in order higher can always be

371
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,760
used to describe and solve problems that

372
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,530
are lower than it and a lot of machines

373
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,920
formalisms actually do the same so we

374
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,400
have many tools for one job available I

375
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,200
mentioned that if unit state automata

376
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,760
regular expressions and regular grammars

377
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,370
are basically the same they're not just

378
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,750
very very that's not just a very strong

379
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,190
connections they're so called Aquila

380
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,070
equivalent so you can always transform

381
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,370
such an automaton into a grandma or red

382
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,200
X and the other way around that's the

383
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,920
important thing

384
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,300
so if at one point you think well array

385
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,580
X would not help me here it would be

386
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,740
very hard to write we very hard to

387
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,930
maintain you can up for in other

388
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,820
implementation of the same formalism and

389
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,430
still have the same power attached to it

390
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,240
and there are other other tools that are

391
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,730
basically formalisms for formal language

392
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,850
just like XML schema or JSON schema or

393
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:35,690
tree automata that you might find useful

394
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,010
so for example you wouldn't you know

395
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,370
implement a finite state automaton by

396
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,890
hand but but knowing like well JSON

397
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,860
schema is is more expressive than that

398
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,430
and I like working with JSON schema you

399
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,350
can use JSON schema to to handle the

400
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,680
task of the finished state automaton

401
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,000
some people say well you should always

402
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,310
use the machine the most easiest the

403
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,990
easiest machine for the job but it's not

404
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,290
really worth losing sleep over how to

405
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,660
implement the most the best machine if

406
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,640
your curl machine is doing the job so

407
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,120
you're not really using losing too much

408
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,240
performance or anything if you do it

409
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,480
right and another thing that's really

410
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,710
really helpful if you know that is

411
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,320
avoiding pork so I'll show you again the

412
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,850
rule our manager put last pairing stops

413
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,790
after 2000 animals and other rules now

414
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,130
you know what as long as they stop

415
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,150
petting at any point we're good

416
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,920
and remember you have to decide

417
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,990
beforehand or not if they're going to

418
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,810
stop or not and we have the example that

419
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,790
they're just going to increase the

420
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,740
number of pet animals every step and

421
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,200
just imagining that humans can pet for

422
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,330
infinite amount of time it would be

423
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,800
really hard to check if they were going

424
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,590
to step to stop at any point or not and

425
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,020
that's what the machine says well like

426
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,520
that's not compute I can you know I can

427
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,320
decide I can say so if the petting stops

428
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,120
at any point if it does but if it does

429
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,920
not I'm not sure because it could step

430
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,410
stop in the next step or in the step

431
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,320
after that so if you're able to

432
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,640
correctly identify which is the problems

433
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,860
if they're solvable or not it can help

434
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,720
you avoid some work you know and then

435
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,990
you can just say no ie I couldn't find

436
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,550
an efficient algorithm or an algorithm

437
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,520
at all that solves that problem but I

438
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,310
could those famous people in my yeah in

439
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,010
my surroundings or in history at all so

440
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,320
this is what's computational complexity

441
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,260
about there are different formalisms

442
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,060
that describe different sets of

443
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,310
languages and some formalisms are more

444
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,180
powerful than others

445
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,580
and knowing how they connect and how

446
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,650
they relate to each other can help you

447
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,000
make your life a bit easier as a

448
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,950
developer so thank you very much that

449
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,390
was it

450
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:24,350
[Applause]
