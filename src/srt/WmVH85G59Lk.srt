[Music]

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,990
hello thank you so much for having me

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,449
I'm super super excited to be here this

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,949
is one of my absolute favorite

5
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,080
conferences and this is such a massive

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,449
and awesome audience so thank you give

7
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:25,949
yourselves all a round of applause

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,009
I love CSS comps because it honestly

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,350
feels like this giant family we're all

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,719
interviews really nerdy things we're all

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,660
into them together and it really just

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,370
feels like this big family so I wanted

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,079
to announce something that I've been

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,430
working on so the past couple of months

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,440
almost a year that kind of feels like my

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,789
baby and this is the only appropriate

17
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,070
place to announce it I'm writing a book

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,020
called the front end developers

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,410
guidebook I just had to announce up here

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,690
cuz I love all of you so this is about

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,460
front-end development everything from

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,649
soft skills like how to learn about side

23
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,320
projects and make time to technical

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,260
skills all foundations also

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,210
internationalisation SEO accessibility

26
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,670
performance all those things so for

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,750
doing that for a while I'm working with

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,060
a publisher is smashing and it'll be out

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,460
soon there's a lot of practical stuff in

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,040
this book but in this talk we'll flip

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,689
that over and we'll end this conference

32
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,119
with more of a party mode we're going to

33
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,460
write a CSS game but don't worry we'll

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,150
go over some something for you to learn

35
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,619
we'll talk about SAS data structures

36
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,180
there's going to be a lot of sass

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,140
involved in this

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,610
we heard some really good talks about

39
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,799
CSS and JavaScript this is going to be

40
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,200
writing functional programs inside of

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,939
sass itself we're going to kind of flip

42
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,310
that script a bit we're going to do some

43
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,600
pixel art we're actually going to create

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,820
some generative pixel art based on

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,470
things that were writing individually

46
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,909
inside of staff so that will be some fun

47
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,450
we'll do some functions and loops will

48
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,060
talk about grid very briefly we'll learn

49
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,640
about some pointer events CSS animation

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,380
and basically how to crash your web

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,270
browser because none of these things are

52
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,189
really great for production but they're

53
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,810
great for making games for having fun

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,610
for experimenting with CSS so let's meet

55
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,770
our cast have you seen these

56
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,730
people around these are our lovely

57
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,580
organizers and MC is here today and I

58
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,170
wanted to kind of bring them in the game

59
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,030
I wanted to give him high fives for the

60
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,010
awesome job that they did putting this

61
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,860
together I was also inspired by Mario so

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,550
I thought maybe I could get the cast of

63
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,430
her game put them into Mario and make

64
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,260
some magic happen so we're going to do

65
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,460
that I brought them into illustrator

66
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,870
first and I mapped out pixel by pixel

67
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,400
exactly what I wanted them to look like

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
and I translated them to map so we rehab

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,910
Paulie Kevin Tim Christina you got

70
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,250
Jessica and once this is all said and

71
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,120
done if all works out well we will have

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,020
created this CSS comp high-fives game oh

73
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,290
gosh has been going a little crazy so

74
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,660
last for eight seconds it counts up our

75
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,240
points all of this is done in just CSS I

76
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,900
am going to use gulp to essentially just

77
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,790
run browser sync so that you're not

78
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,230
waiting for me while I'm doing this and

79
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,620
also runs off but yeah let's get started

80
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,140
this all boils down to CSS and HTML so

81
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,490
the first thing we wanted to do is build

82
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,440
those characters but those characters

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,090
are going to take a while doing them

84
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,830
pixel by pixel so we'll do a little bit

85
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,290
of a simplified demo with a heart first

86
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,700
thing we want to do is hook this into

87
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,950
the HTML with a clasp we'll call this

88
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,760
class pixelize heart I'm using EMA so I

89
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,709
just hit tab it creates that for me then

90
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,900
I want to open my heart F CSS and get

91
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,850
started next thing that we want to do is

92
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,459
create a map of color so thus they want

93
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,740
to use red and transparent we can map

94
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,900
this with a key and a value so we can

95
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,450
map this with ofer transparent and then

96
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,140
we can use our for red cool so now we

97
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,340
know what colors we're going to

98
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,290
correlate our pixels to the second thing

99
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,030
that we can do is determine the size of

100
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,550
the pixels so let's make this 20s a

101
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,750
little bit easier to see for all you out

102
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,209
there now what we can do is start

103
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,370
creating this pixel art I have a map

104
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,380
called pixel art it's a variable and I'm

105
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,970
going to have multiple maps inside of

106
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,680
that map so I'm going to call this map

107
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,720
heart and that's going to be a map

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,310
itself and we're going to create this by

109
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,530
adding multiple lines that are included

110
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,720
in parentheses determine the number of

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,060
rows that we have

112
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,740
going to have six rows it's going to

113
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,030
look something like this and they're

114
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,200
going to fill those with the pixels that

115
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,960
we're expecting to have trust me there's

116
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,100
a method to my madness

117
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,560
you can then go through and draw out all

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,770
these pixels individually like you would

119
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,150
see in a heart and I know that you can't

120
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,650
see it yet but in a moment I can

121
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,080
highlight all these Reds and show you

122
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,300
what it's going to look like in a moment

123
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,780
so here I am just drawing this out and I

124
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,880
could see that I've aired here so I'm

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,210
going to fix that and really you can

126
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,620
just set these colors you can apply

127
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,900
multiple colors you can create like

128
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,700
stripes if I want to if I could add more

129
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,320
colors to the list but when I highlight

130
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,660
the Reds you can see very lightly that

131
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,580
I've created a heart out of OHS and ours

132
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,010
to create this pixel map so we have our

133
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,260
heart pixel map but now we need to read

134
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,080
through this entire map to pull out

135
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,850
those pixels what we're going to be

136
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,979
using here is box shadow because box

137
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,710
shadow is really easy to hack and it

138
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,750
allows us to give an unlimited number of

139
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,180
arguments in the property list itself so

140
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,260
we can have an unlimited number of

141
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,270
arguments and we can place them based on

142
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,789
an x and y coordinates from the top left

143
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,539
as pixel values so let's just make this

144
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,160
let's write that function because we can

145
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,950
write functions in that so inside of

146
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,289
here I'm going to say we first are going

147
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:44,300
to generate the shadow list so we can

148
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,310
create an empty string to begin with and

149
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,470
we'll fill that as we go and then we're

150
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,750
going to also need to get the road so as

151
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,580
I mentioned earlier the roads is going

152
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,700
to be the length of the matrix since we

153
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,340
have six of these one two three four

154
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,260
five six going down that's going to then

155
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,350
denote the roads for our entire matrix

156
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,820
and we can iterate through those roads

157
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,340
to get the actual row number so in SAS

158
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,840
we can also use a for-loop

159
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,860
at four row from one through the number

160
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,010
of rows here so here I'm going to use

161
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,770
rows and variable that we just set I'm

162
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,750
going to set that row number so it's

163
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,669
just going to be row num and then we can

164
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,919
use the int value to pull that in to the

165
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,770
nth value of the matrix and the row so

166
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,360
now we know what the actual row number

167
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,000
is that we have landed on now we can

168
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,650
filter that again and get the column

169
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,580
number

170
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,860
the column is going to be at 4:00 call

171
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,520
from one through the length of the row

172
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,720
number because that means that we're

173
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,150
going to go through all nine values that

174
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,639
are in that row and get the column value

175
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,860
and finally we can see where the dot is

176
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,479
so from that we can see if the dot is

177
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,319
the end value of the row number in the

178
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:02,330
column so now we know if we are in an R

179
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,090
or an O value once we have that we can

180
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,460
start building this shadow list of you

181
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,009
have so the shadow list then becomes the

182
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,419
shadow list this is how you append in

183
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:14,120
SAS plus the values that were pulling

184
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,979
from here so we can get the exposition

185
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,469
by using size the pixel value that we

186
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,949
set us twenty pixels times the column

187
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,659
plus me to have a space here for the

188
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:26,539
syntax of drop shadow plus the size

189
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:30,770
times the row and from here we can get

190
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,479
the color so we also want to add another

191
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,029
space we want to then map guess which is

192
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,039
how we access items inside of the map

193
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,810
itself we're going to access from the

194
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,629
colors map and then use the dot value to

195
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,849
pull in either transparent or red now

196
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:45,560
we're converting that from a no earn are

197
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,379
to transparent or red we're almost done

198
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:50,180
with this item the shadow list but next

199
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,639
we then have to add a comma we have to

200
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,199
have a comma between every single item

201
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,060
in this list except for the very last

202
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,800
item because if the last item has a

203
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,389
comma it'll invalidate and it won't show

204
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:02,210
up so we have to do a negated if

205
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,460
statement so let's say at if not how is

206
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,250
equal to the length of row num which

207
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,629
means that we're at the very last item

208
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,229
right number nine and rest the very last

209
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,599
row so we can say Rho is equal to Rose

210
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,520
then we want to add a comma then the

211
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,219
shadow list becomes the shadow list plus

212
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:28,669
a comma cool so the last thing I want to

213
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,529
do is return a value we have to use at

214
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:33,949
return unquote because currently it is

215
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:36,860
still a string that we have unquote the

216
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,449
shadow list and we can finally return a

217
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:40,039
value so nothing is going to appear

218
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,810
until we actually use it inside of our

219
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,060
div that we created in the page so let's

220
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,529
make this an after pseudo element and

221
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,540
then apply any of the height and of

222
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,459
width first so the height can be the

223
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,460
size and the width

224
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,600
can be the size and we want to give us a

225
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,430
content since it's a after suit helmet

226
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,380
this is going to be very fast ESS so I

227
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,590
apologize about all of the like improper

228
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,910
placement of all these things if you

229
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,500
always make sure they're nice and neat

230
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,810
and orderly and inside the box and we

231
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,640
can use a function on the right hand

232
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,770
side of the property so here we'll use

233
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,030
our function which is called pixel eyes

234
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,550
and we need to map yet because again the

235
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,490
heart map is inside of another map so

236
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,210
we're going to map get pixel art yep

237
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,620
pixel art is our a sort of map of our

238
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,050
map map get pixel art and heart and then

239
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,970
we're going to send the size value again

240
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,070
which is default and it's set globally

241
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,410
here so once I save this our heart will

242
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,510
appear appears in the screen I somehow

243
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:43,610
didn't mess up that's great

244
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,710
the next thing I'm going to do is step

245
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,330
in set this I'm going to use this

246
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,279
ampersand which acts as an anchor in

247
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,500
sass so what will happen here is I can

248
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,210
edit pixelized Hart give it some

249
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,980
properties and it still has six pies

250
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,100
Hart after setup in there I'm going to

251
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,110
give this an outline so I can debug this

252
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,410
a line 1px solid as you see that this

253
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,480
element is not taking up any space on

254
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,980
the page because we haven't given it a

255
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,990
width or a height and that's not great

256
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,360
if you want to use this within our game

257
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,790
itself it has to take up some space so

258
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,710
first I want to give a special relative

259
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:21,810
oh and I then want to give it a width

260
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,040
and height and I'm going to be using

261
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,570
that based on the size that we've

262
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,070
dynamically created in this nature

263
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,380
because we can also set the size so I'm

264
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,920
going to give it a height and the height

265
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,660
again is the length that matrix times

266
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,240
the size so get the pixel size and

267
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,250
multiply it by the length of that matrix

268
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,980
and in this case the matrix is map get

269
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,589
pixel art Hart copy that paste it in

270
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,040
there and then height the width is going

271
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,690
to be the length of one of those columns

272
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,460
so since we're out inside that loop

273
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,310
again we can get the size and the length

274
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,470
of just one of those columns so we're

275
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,210
going to have to map get one of them and

276
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,180
use that nth value again to say ends of

277
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,330
this matrix and the first column because

278
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,020
why not so say that and it is now

279
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,300
properly placed but you can see that

280
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,860
it's shifted over and the reason why is

281
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,720
because black shadow starts at the

282
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,850
bottom right corner of the div it starts

283
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,380
at the end of it so now we have to shift

284
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,020
this up so we can say top of negative

285
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,320
size maybe left of negative size and

286
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,900
boom our heart is placed inside of the

287
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,959
div as we expected based on this heart

288
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,940
that we just created out of literally

289
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,400
letters on the screen together here so

290
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,080
we can then take this idea and open

291
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,170
something like I have a character's SCSS

292
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,750
where I already did this and I'm going

293
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,730
to just uncomment and zoom out of here

294
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,820
so you can see what the characters

295
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,550
actually look like my vision is forever

296
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,920
ruined but it's fine

297
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,310
so if I

298
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,410
save this and then I open I have a

299
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,860
characters file you can see all the

300
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,420
characters have appeared out of this

301
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,010
generated map and you can dynamically

302
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,470
change the colors so like if I wanted to

303
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,110
go into here and I wanted to change all

304
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,250
of the black to like a red because why

305
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,650
not once I save this instantly it'll all

306
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,330
change so you can just create this art

307
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,370
dynamically in your browser and it's

308
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,380
really fun to play with you can also

309
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,540
animate this if you're a masochist

310
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,190
and want to make your browser run really

311
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,860
slowly it wouldn't recommend animating

312
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,430
box-shadow

313
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,790
but it is an option so the next thing we

314
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,130
want to do is keep some score we have

315
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,630
our characters but we don't really have

316
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,600
our game set so we have to create like

317
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,750
our entire game area in here we're going

318
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,790
to use Emmet to make this really quick

319
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,760
for ourselves I'm going to have a list

320
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,740
so just UL and that list is going to

321
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,460
have a class of game area and then

322
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,290
within that I want to have a couple of

323
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,630
list items so I can say that I want to

324
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,330
have a list item next to that I want to

325
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,680
have an input it's going to be a

326
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,630
checkbox so it's going to type equals

327
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,610
checkbox this is going to be our click

328
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,230
area that we're going to use to sort of

329
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,240
make sure that we've counted up these

330
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,430
points from once we click we'll count up

331
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:12,970
the points

332
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,560
next to that we have a div and it's

333
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,600
going to be a character and with Emmet

334
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,700
you can just do times three hit tab and

335
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,460
now I have this list and within it I

336
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,440
have these three list items inside the

337
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,540
list item I have an input and I have our

338
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,310
character nothing is going to show up

339
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,080
until I go through and make sure that I

340
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,070
add a little character so here I can say

341
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,350
pixel eyes maybe we'll have a Kevin in

342
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,600
there we can have three Kevin's or I can

343
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,630
mix this up and add like let's add poly

344
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,080
here let's add a Christina on our screen

345
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,180
and now all of our characters are happy

346
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,440
and have appeared and they're ready for

347
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,339
high fives also with these boxes you can

348
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:53,050
add a border radius make them round you

349
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,400
can make them bigger or smaller based on

350
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,680
the pixel size it's four pixels here but

351
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,209
it really allows for a variety of

352
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:01,150
options that you can play around with so

353
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,040
we also want to add a place for our

354
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,170
score to show up here so we can just

355
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,360
have an h2 with a score and then inside

356
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,060
of that lets get a span with a class of

357
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,290
score that will access

358
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,620
later to show our points go zoom out

359
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,899
there a little you know with this screen

360
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,600
here alright so the next thing we want

361
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,660
to do is then open a new CSS file just

362
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,910
to keep it organized we're going to open

363
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,120
our game play s CSS so game plays it's

364
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,480
called

365
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,670
I've opened this now we need to design

366
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,889
this click area so that's not just a

367
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,529
small check box over there so we can

368
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,899
just quickly edit this maybe give it a

369
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:40,319
position of absolute so that it shows

370
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:43,779
within its parent there we can give it a

371
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:48,910
display:block and then we can do some

372
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,649
things like give it an outline so we can

373
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:53,230
debug this this is my favorite way to

374
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,050
debug because outline doesn't take any

375
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,269
space on the page whereas border does so

376
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:00,279
I have that outlined maybe I want to

377
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,079
give it a width of 40 pixels and a

378
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,850
height of 40 pixels so you can see it

379
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,250
it's currently behind the characters I

380
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,819
believe so we need to give it a Z index

381
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,529
the index of three could work at this

382
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:12,790
point I'd probably want to create a Z

383
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,040
index map and then use that to adjust

384
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,480
accordingly so that everything is

385
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,949
orderly but like I said we're just going

386
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:20,199
to speed right this game and then here I

387
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,630
can do appearance none to get rid of

388
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,209
that checkbox this works really well in

389
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,149
WebKit and in Chrome does not work in

390
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:30,579
Firefox so you would have to create a

391
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:32,649
span that surrounds your check box style

392
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,380
that span and have appearance none on

393
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,000
your check not a parent son you have to

394
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,589
have a display of nominative checkbox in

395
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,839
order to make this work in Firefox so

396
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,190
everything else will be identical except

397
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,079
for this little quick area I also want

398
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,430
to give us a top of like negative 10

399
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,040
pixels and a left of like negative 5 so

400
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,670
that it just positions nicely maybe you

401
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,040
want to give it a tap of 10 so once I've

402
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,360
done that when I click on it now you

403
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,459
can't tell that it clicked on it so we

404
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,290
need to make sure that there's some kind

405
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,300
of feedback mechanism I don't even know

406
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,649
that I can hover over it because the

407
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:04,540
cursor hasn't changed so a really nice

408
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,060
cursor for this is called grab because

409
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,399
it's like a little hand you I don't know

410
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,660
if you could see you here basic a little

411
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,220
hand hovering here that's a little hand

412
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,899
for the high-five so that was good we

413
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,699
now know that we're hovering and maybe

414
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:17,740
we want to add a property of if it's

415
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,800
checked given like a background of green

416
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,660
or something so we know we clicked on it

417
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,150
ok cool so we know now what's things

418
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,100
what's not we can get rid of this we'll

419
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,050
deal with that later we can get rid of

420
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,720
this outline great let's count up some

421
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,700
points so here we currently have score

422
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,230
and we have a span next to it with a

423
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,060
class of score that has nothing in it

424
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,160
because we haven't provided any value

425
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,870
but we can do this with a property

426
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,510
called counter increment in CSS counter

427
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,160
increment was originally intended for

428
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,600
outlines when you have an unlimited

429
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,730
amount of data that you're counting up

430
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,620
and you want to be able to just

431
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,960
increment it up we can use counter

432
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,120
increments in our game to check where we

433
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,700
have our check boxes and apply the value

434
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,370
put it out on the game so inside of

435
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,960
score we can give it an after clear

436
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,360
element with content and the content

437
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,100
that we're spending over that we're

438
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,689
pulling some Dom sending over is going

439
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:10,720
to be the counter of a game so once I

440
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,050
save this zero will appear because we

441
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,300
don't have any points yet on the game

442
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,350
and we can mitigate that by adding the

443
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,910
rest of the things that matter so the

444
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:27,400
game area needs a counter reset of game

445
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,100
we're naming it here and then after that

446
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,490
we want to give the Kliq area when it is

447
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:40,420
checked a counter increment of game when

448
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,700
I say that now once I've clicked on

449
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,980
these you'll see that it's starting to

450
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,040
count up our score so counter increment

451
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,540
can be used for that if you want to make

452
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,100
this game even challenging we can also

453
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,280
use a decrement catta increment is won

454
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,500
by nature but you can customize it so

455
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,809
you can add multiple points negative

456
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,240
points and really play this up we want

457
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,330
to make it challenging so we do want to

458
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,770
make it more challenging not in that way

459
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,240
but we want to add a shield because

460
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,280
right now I can just click on all of

461
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,610
these and count up and I win so let's go

462
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,070
back into our index let's you know get

463
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,510
rid of some of this stuff I'm going to

464
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,820
say that to my clipboard because we want

465
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,580
to add a shield inside of our list we

466
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,740
still have this unordered list with a

467
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,960
class of game area inside of that we

468
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,610
still have our list item but instead of

469
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,260
having it directly next to the input and

470
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,660
click area of the character we want to

471
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,540
wrap that inside of a character wrapper

472
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,240
so let's say we're going to say dot care

473
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,020
sir wrapper and then next to that we

474
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,059
want to have a shield so we're going to

475
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,830
have a shield plus a character wrapper

476
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,870
and maybe we want to have nine of those

477
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,360
so once I hit tab now I have my list

478
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,669
item with the shield a character wrapper

479
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,260
inside of the character wrapper we have

480
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,690
our checkbox aka our click area we have

481
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,090
our characters and we're ready to go and

482
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,010
make this game what it is we also have 9

483
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,510
of them so we can make kind of a grid a

484
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,820
3x3 grid and here I can go through and

485
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,149
add pixelized characters let's have all

486
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:09,880
of the Tim's just lines right up know

487
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,230
about all the other characters here

488
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,080
let's add a Jessica let's add a

489
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,870
Christina let's here let's add a Kevin

490
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,919
let's see Poli there might be a few

491
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,110
multiple multiples so they're all here

492
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,730
we have four times in a row but it's

493
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,200
fine he likes to give high fives we'll

494
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,200
just leave that so they're all kind of

495
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,120
on top of each other I'm actually going

496
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,620
to change them because it looks looks a

497
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,539
little crowded they're all on top of

498
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,279
each other we want to arrange them on

499
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,200
the screen here so we're going to use

500
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,320
some CSS grid fun have you all used CSS

501
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,919
grid for how many of you used it I'm

502
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,380
seeing like a quarter of you it's really

503
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,350
amazing like oh it just gives me the

504
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,590
shivers I love CSS grid okay so we have

505
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,899
our click area right and the first thing

506
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,820
that we want to do is give it a display

507
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,340
of grid I'm first going to style the

508
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,289
list items so that you can see it and

509
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,149
see what's happening here I'm going to

510
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:08,830
give it a background of Dodger blue

511
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,919
unlike the papaya whip that Glen's like

512
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,919
I am a Dodger blue kind of girl so we

513
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,320
have that color I'm going to then go

514
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,409
back into our grid and applies the magic

515
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:22,240
nothing is happening yet but when I give

516
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,440
it a grid template it's just

517
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,270
automatically going to fall into place

518
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,909
I want that 3x3 grid so I'm going to

519
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:29,740
just use the fractional unit which says

520
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,110
cake up as much of this remaining space

521
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,539
as possible within this fractional unit

522
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,130
so if I use one it's going to all be

523
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,230
even to each other and then I can say I

524
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,990
want one two three rows and then I want

525
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,720
one two three columns you can also use a

526
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,909
repeat property inside of grid to do

527
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,320
this but it's a little bit more clear

528
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,750
right now if I just do when fr one Fr

529
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,590
went too far

530
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:57,440
okay so this isn't moving but I'm

531
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,140
wondering what I wrote wrong when I fire

532
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,670
over one well let's let's find out as I

533
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,750
save this out the the board isn't giving

534
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,480
me a background here either let's see if

535
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,980
I I spell something wrong what is it

536
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,700
click area you're right it's game area

537
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,800
that's exactly this is why I love you

538
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,850
all you're sitting in front of me

539
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,440
awesome so if I give it the correct

540
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,180
class name you know live coding who

541
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,860
thought something could go wrong

542
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,380
it appears powerfully as I expected and

543
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,350
then here I can give it a grid gap of

544
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,440
say like 20 pixels and only the space

545
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,260
between the pixels moves it's like magic

546
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,180
nothing on the outside we don't have to

547
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,490
work with these like weird end values or

548
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,730
last child hacks it just works the way

549
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,680
you expect it to and now we're going to

550
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,660
do that mysterious second biggest

551
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,760
problem of computer science and Center

552
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,650
things so we're going to vertically

553
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,870
align this with display flex we're going

554
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,920
to do a line items Center and we're

555
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,090
going to do justify content center here

556
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,280
so once I save that all these elements

557
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,590
will be kind of aligned within the space

558
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,800
we're going to then use some margins

559
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,390
here to center this area we're going to

560
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,270
give it a width of like a tvw and a

561
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,060
height of say a tvw and then we want to

562
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,980
do a margin so you're Auto so it's

563
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,210
centered inner screen and looks a little

564
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,120
bit nicer here cool we've got that now

565
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,490
we have this shield so I just pre wrote

566
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,870
it because it's just placement

567
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,090
background with height absolute

568
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,770
positioning but we have it in front of

569
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,910
our character so when you click you

570
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,460
can't access that hand unless you go a

571
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,100
little higher to get that score value up

572
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,990
we want to bring the score back into

573
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,450
here so let's go ahead and add that back

574
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,080
in and when I click up you'll see that I

575
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,930
can reach the hand here but not here so

576
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:55,160
we'll needs to go back in to our board

577
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,050
or our game play file to make this even

578
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,060
harder because we can still tally up

579
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,390
these points it's

580
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,130
not something of challenging until we

581
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,630
make it challenging and we can do that

582
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,170
by using some animations so let's go

583
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,549
back into this file and add some CSS

584
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:11,070
animations we can use keyframes to do

585
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,740
this we're going to say keyframes of

586
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,750
move because we don't have to be

587
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,760
creative we'll just really quickly come

588
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,260
up with a name I'm going to have this go

589
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,830
from 0% to 50% because at 60% I'm going

590
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,900
to have it alternate and it's just going

591
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,429
to go like a little bounce so we're

592
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:28,679
going from 0 to 100 and I'm going to use

593
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,650
a transform property to move this in a

594
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,870
way that it's going to translate why to

595
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,580
move up and down so I'm going to say

596
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,850
it's transform translate Y and it's

597
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,890
going to go from negative 25 pixels to

598
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,160
25 pixels I'm going to apply this to

599
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,960
both the character and the click area

600
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,720
this animation which is a move I'm going

601
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,110
to say is 0.5 seconds it's going to be

602
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,640
forever they're going to be jumping up

603
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,669
at us infinite and it's going to be

604
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:01,740
alternating for that bounce and it's

605
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,940
going to be moving forward because we

606
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,820
want the paint to move forward all right

607
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,340
going to save that and now our

608
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,260
characters are all jumping up at the

609
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,210
same rate ready to give us high-five it

610
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,400
is much harder now to click and to grab

611
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,010
them while they're up there but it's

612
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,690
still kind of weird that our characters

613
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,419
are all moving at the same rate here on

614
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,660
the screen so we can now use another for

615
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,669
loop in sass but instead of doing it

616
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:27,750
inside of our class we're going to

617
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,460
generate our classes within the for loop

618
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,970
so let's say at 4 we'll use i from 1

619
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,580
through 9 which is the number of

620
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,080
characters that we have you can also use

621
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,970
a variable for this we'll set a speed

622
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,890
and here we can use a sass random

623
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,900
function within this to create different

624
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,299
animation durations different speeds for

625
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,750
our characters so let's use random and

626
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,450
we'll do random times like 1.5 and then

627
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,950
we have to add the second so that it

628
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,870
knows what we're using here for the

629
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,630
duration so now we can say we want our

630
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,840
list items and we can use end child a

631
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,610
selector we're going to interpolate that

632
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,980
I variable so we can use it within this

633
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,720
class name this class like that we're

634
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
creating here and inside of that we want

635
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,740
to give it the speed so here we're going

636
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,140
to say for all the characters and all of

637
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,960
the click area

638
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,930
within this list item with an end of 1

639
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,330
through 9 we are going to change up the

640
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,000
animation duration and overwrite it to

641
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,560
be again interpolating that speed

642
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,870
variable hit save and now they will all

643
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,170
be moving at different rates hope we got

644
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,550
an excited Tim and Kevin here mmm maybe

645
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,820
I like this 2.5 alright that's a little

646
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,280
bit better Tim is still very excited to

647
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,770
be playing this game so this is starting

648
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,120
to look more like what we're expecting

649
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,310
but we still are going to ultimately

650
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,960
always be winning because we don't have

651
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,180
a time limit yet so let's add a time

652
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,670
limit we go back into our index we can

653
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,070
then create a class like a stopper class

654
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,020
so we'll create a stopper and inside

655
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,820
this will have like an h3 that says game

656
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,020
over sorry and we'll save that and then

657
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,300
we can go into our board I have it here

658
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,800
again so I could just uncomment that

659
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,470
it's currently just on our page but what

660
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,300
this is doing is its styling it so that

661
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,820
is being an override of the page it's

662
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,710
taking the full width and height getting

663
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,960
that background of cyan I'm increasing

664
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,460
the font size a little bit for styling

665
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,800
purposes but now we want to move this

666
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,020
off of the page so we want to do H

667
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,130
transform translate Y of negative 100 Z

668
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,440
H so it just moves off the page and we

669
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,360
want that to eventually appear in when

670
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,370
we want thing to move in CSS we have to

671
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,890
add an animation so let's add that let's

672
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,550
do a keyframe for stopper we'll name the

673
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,950
animation stopper and we'll do a from

674
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,550
init to here and we can use this value

675
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,070
this transform translate why so we

676
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,190
wanted to move from negative 100 V H to

677
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,370
0 V H so it goes back to the original

678
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,140
location on the page there's kind of

679
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,750
like that reverse animation that we

680
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,130
heard about before with some of those

681
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,230
awesome data visualizations so we're

682
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,560
going to apply this to our stopper we're

683
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,520
going to say we want to add an animation

684
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,520
of stopper make that 0.5 seconds this

685
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,290
could also be a variable really great

686
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,700
for you're creating style systems to

687
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,200
variable eyes your animations they have

688
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,600
the same look and feel to them also with

689
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,980
your Bezier curves and any kind of

690
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,840
animation curve you have there I'm just

691
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,310
using linear for now so I'm leaving it

692
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,050
at its default and so I have this

693
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,100
animation I also

694
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,370
on the paint to go forward so it ends as

695
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,220
it goes so I save this is pops in but

696
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,539
that's a very short game the game is

697
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,850
like less than half of a second long so

698
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,140
they can use this animation delay

699
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,480
property to make our game

700
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,160
eight seconds longer or something like

701
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,559
that so once i refresh this page it's

702
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,750
going to take eight seconds and tell the

703
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,490
animation stops working and I want to

704
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,660
pull this out into a game link variable

705
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,860
so we're going to have a game length be

706
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,630
eight seconds and then I can diffuse

707
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,490
that and use that and propagate it

708
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,770
through the rest so if you have noticed

709
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,480
we've lost our score the score is now

710
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,000
behind our stopper because we haven't

711
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,940
styled it yet an entire score is an h2

712
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,039
don't fight me on this it's just a demo

713
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,679
yes you should namespace all of these

714
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:13,770
things but we then want to style at h2

715
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,020
that appears above we're just going to

716
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,010
do a z-index here of ten we are going to

717
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,159
give it a position:relative and then

718
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,419
we're going to also give this an

719
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,789
animation we want this to appear but not

720
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,070
from negative 100 to zero we want this

721
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,250
to appear from zero to negative fifty VH

722
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,520
because that way it can pop in and kind

723
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,350
of go in with this game over

724
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,710
so I haven't applied this yet oh gosh

725
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,360
this is at the top of the page I think

726
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,740
just title this has to be positioned oh

727
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,059
that's why okay so this this needs to be

728
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,070
scored we haven't applied this yet we're

729
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,929
going to apply it here when we apply

730
00:28:57,929 --> 00:28:59,400
this animation you're my favorite person

731
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,250
in here right now thank you

732
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,720
so here we go we're going to apply the

733
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,850
stopper we're going to have it have the

734
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,289
same animations laid but maybe we want

735
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:09,570
to add like 0.25 seconds so it occurs a

736
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,460
little bit later than the last one and

737
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,419
so once we play this refresh after eight

738
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,309
seconds the first one will appear after

739
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:19,350
eight point two five seconds the second

740
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,820
one will appear and we'll have a nice

741
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,049
little pop in effect for this game so

742
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:28,039
that appears that way I want this to

743
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:31,679
continue to look a little nicer so we

744
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,419
can do some more things here by applying

745
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:38,419
some um

746
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:41,639
some notifications you've clicked on the

747
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:43,559
characters like right now if I'm playing

748
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,999
this game I clicking on the characters

749
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,340
they're still moving around you don't

750
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,559
really get any feedback the UI of this

751
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,409
isn't that great because I don't know

752
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:53,700
that I've really gotten the score and

753
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,249
left I look down so we can then go into

754
00:29:56,249 --> 00:30:00,059
our click area and say if the click area

755
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:03,210
is checked we want to stop the animation

756
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,440
and this is why before when I was

757
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,269
applying those animations I applied them

758
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:08,070
to both the click area and the character

759
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,330
instead of doing the character wrapper

760
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,039
because we're using this click area and

761
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,769
it's sibling the div right next to it to

762
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:16,259
apply the stopping so with this check we

763
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,830
want to say animation nun we also want

764
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,080
to say pointer events nun because that

765
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,700
means that it's no longer going to be

766
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,950
able to be clicked on you can't unclick

767
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,389
you can't remove your score

768
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:29,639
we also are say any character next to

769
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:32,129
this is going to get an animation nun

770
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:36,480
and we want to maybe add a filter so

771
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,889
here we can apply like a grayscale

772
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:41,669
filter to it and as we play we can

773
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:44,549
refresh once I have clicked on this

774
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,769
eager little person they're hard to

775
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:51,720
click sometimes they they should be

776
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,940
stopping so let's debug click area

777
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,580
checks animation done pointer events

778
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:03,119
none let's see this theoretically should

779
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,539
be stopping but I'm wondering why it's

780
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,759
not maybe I'm not clicking on them maybe

781
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:11,039
I am when this happens you have all

782
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,799
these things being saved so believe me

783
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,029
this usually works I'm going to go to

784
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:19,859
another branch I have which is called

785
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:22,950
step 12 and then I'm going to hit gulp

786
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,179
and it's going to all be magically done

787
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,460
for me when i refresh I'm going to click

788
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,690
that and it's stopping now

789
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,659
so it looks like the code is the same I

790
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,149
may have done some kind of strange thing

791
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:35,489
I'm going to refresh that I'm going to

792
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:37,289
just close out of it and open board as

793
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:41,549
CSS but yeah maybe I just wrote this

794
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:43,649
wrong anyway as I'm clicking this it's

795
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:45,509
stopping the propagation of the event

796
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:48,119
this character stops moving we now know

797
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,409
that we clicked them as they stopped

798
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,669
moving that one which is really hard to

799
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:51,510
click we have a

800
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,550
SCOR we have our game let's add that

801
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,080
heart back and then we created since

802
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,360
that heart is an after pseudo element we

803
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,860
can go and then just extend the class

804
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,350
we've created so we can say add extend

805
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:06,600
dot pixelized heart and when we replay

806
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,180
the game a little heart animation a

807
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,830
little heart will appear once I've

808
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,510
clicked it so I clicked it the heart is

809
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,360
there we can even give this a margin top

810
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,240
of negative 25 pixels so it appears just

811
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,090
on top of that character and we have

812
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,150
created here in like 35 minutes a CSS

813
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,710
game live on stage with all of your help

814
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:33,480
so thank you it's a difficult game

815
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,410
[Applause]

so what I really want you to get from

818
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,110
the talk is while you do these things

819
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,880
there are so many a CSS properties that

820
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,070
you might not use for everything but

821
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,870
there are so many uses of them that are

822
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,480
creative uses if you go onto code pen

823
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,250
you can find through really awesome

824
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,860
examples of CSS games you can even play

825
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,370
this game if you go to this site you

829
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,230
your own game you can improve it you can

830
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,290
build upon it you can play it and you

831
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,850
