00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,519

hello everybody hear me yes cool hi

2
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,500
everyone my name is Nicholas Belmonte

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,480
and today I'm going to be talking about

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,099
from data journalism to data

5
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:21,430
illustration so basically the work we do

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,380
at Twitter visualizing data so i work at

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,179
twitter on the visual insights team it's

8
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:29,289
a small team that does data

9
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:31,750
visualizations and I lead the

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,090
interactive the twitter com project it's

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,860
a web page that has public facing data

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,750
visualizations it's the across team

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,790
effort between like the communications

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,100
team the marketing teams and the

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,280
analytics team which is the team I am on

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,549
and yeah the main idea behind the data

17
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:56,199
visualisations we do which is public

18
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:57,970
facing stuff is trying to kind of

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,860
leverage the cool things about the

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,080
platform right so the platform has I'd

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,059
say like three kind of main features

22
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,100
were global we've been called the pulse

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,990
of the planet many times you probably

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,460
have seen data visualizations of like

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,619
when people you know wake up and go to

26
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:13,329
sleep and how that correlates with the

27
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,740
number of tweets they make and stuff

28
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,689
like that so we are really the post of

29
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:18,070
your planet also the fact that we're

30
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,710
real time and that's like a pretty big

31
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,539
challenge for data visualization having

32
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:25,060
like a real-time platform and finally

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,070
conversational right so you have you

34
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,570
know within the text of a tweet you have

35
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,030
at mentions and you have hash tags which

36
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,920
are kind of like channels but you also

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,469
can explore other stuff within the text

38
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:38,020
like you know men named entity

39
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,939
recognition topic analysis sentiment

40
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:42,490
analysis on off stuff so there's a lot

41
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,350
of things that you can take out of those

42
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,340
140 characters so what we try to do is

43
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,609
focus on different verticals and the

44
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,649
verticals we have depend on kind of like

45
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,899
the audience we have so we can really

46
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,609
find those verticals as well but when we

47
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,259
plan on doing data visualizations we

48
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:03,490
have government news sports TV and music

49
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,979
and kind of those verticals determine

50
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,140
how you're going to be thinking about

51
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,090
doing the visualization and the main

52
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,700
idea is like what is the tone of the

53
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,280
visualization are going to be working on

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,560
do I have to tell a story we have to

55
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,900
present a lot of data like a million

56
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,090
data elements to you and for

57
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,680
you to explore and try to you know get

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,830
your own findings do I need to expose

59
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,230
the point it's a like explosive data

60
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,970
visualization or do I have to just be

61
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,040
fun and you know make you play with the

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,260
data and like maybe doesn't really have

63
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,000
to be that insightful right so yeah so

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm going to try to show a bunch of data

65
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,670
visualisations or work we did around

66
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,160
these verticals and kind of like show

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,709
you how we work and maybe inspire you to

68
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,239
you know when you're creating your own

69
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,940
data but also agents to you some of this

70
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,120
kind of approaches of course we use web

71
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,730
standards for all this right so the

72
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,880
stuff i like the most is government

73
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,739
database but it's also i know like the

74
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:08,829
less fun and a bit more boring but we

75
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:10,930
worked on this one for the state of the

76
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,110
union address this is like it's done

77
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,000
once yearly it's like the president of

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,019
the united states gives a speech and and

79
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,150
so what we try to do is like government

80
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,799
people or the people within the

81
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,239
government really read like long

82
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,220
documents and stuff like that and so

83
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,480
what we try to do is like to present

84
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,639
that very same document but enhanced

85
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,680
with with the data visualization right

86
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:40,060
so let's try this yep slowly so what we

87
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,950
did here is at the top you have a

88
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,200
summary of the of the speech basically

89
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,569
the stream graph and we need topic

90
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:48,250
analysis on tweets that happen during

91
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,560
the address of the president so these

92
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,250
are tweets that talk about energy jobs

93
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,829
fairness healthcare defense etc the

94
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,349
other cool thing is that this is not

95
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:00,849
only a summary of what happened during

96
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,790
the address is also an index so if I

97
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,889
like enter the page and like I don't

98
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,750
really care much about reading like 40

99
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,630
pages of like a transcript for for a for

100
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,329
speech maybe what I can just do is well

101
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,190
I care about you know what the president

102
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,630
said about health care and so I can just

103
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,910
go click there and so this takes me

104
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,450
exactly to the time to what the

105
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,979
president was saying when these tweets

106
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,010
occurred so on the right one we have is

107
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,780
kind of like something that leverages a

108
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,669
bit more the real-time aspect of the

109
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,979
platform and as you know when you scroll

110
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:33,770
down

111
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,139
tell you what is the most discussed

112
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:38,599
topic on twitter and also the

113
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,629
distribution of those tweets so like you

114
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:43,430
can say you know people in like this

115
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,620
specific state care about a lot about

116
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,860
health care but if you go over to adult

117
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,479
defense it'll tell you that you know

118
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,340
some other states care more about

119
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,860
defense and so the main idea within the

120
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,990
government type of data visualisations

121
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,780
is always try to try to enhance whatever

122
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,050
document we have and so how we did this

123
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,289
is a very iterative process with a lot

124
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,659
of feedback and you know looking as much

125
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,849
as you can the first the first iteration

126
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:15,979
was this we didn't know we were going to

127
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,139
have the transcript before the speech

128
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:20,090
because we annotated every paragraph

129
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,000
with the timestamp of like you know when

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,219
did he start saying this till the end of

131
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:26,690
that paragraph and then grabbed tweets

132
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,580
and did that topic analysis for that

133
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,530
specific paragraph so in order to do

134
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,909
that you need to have the transcript

135
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:34,550
before the president actually says

136
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,530
anything before the actual speech and

137
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,900
that's props to the media team for

138
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,560
having that so what we did is the first

139
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,210
approach just have like you know every

140
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,190
row is a minute every column is a

141
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,870
different state in the United States and

142
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,400
then we'll just have like volume of

143
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,000
tweets and this was horrible like I show

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,009
this to a team I was like I I mean

145
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:57,860
there's nothing interesting from this no

146
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,020
no interesting inside anything instead

147
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,759
of having the transcript we were just

148
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,469
planning on just putting some quotes on

149
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:04,819
the right that the president mentioned

150
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,310
during that minute and then at the

151
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,930
bottom instead of having like a topic

152
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,180
analysis we were just using a word

153
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,430
frequency count so for example we're

154
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,779
just like kind of the frequency of the

155
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,340
words in the tweets for that minute so

156
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,440
in this case is you know it's the third

157
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,840
minute within the speech and the words

158
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,669
you can see are like Obama president

159
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:24,969
State Union watching watch which

160
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:27,650
basically means I just got here i'm

161
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,370
watching the state of the union address

162
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,800
so this was the second second iteration

163
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,169
we already knew we were going to have to

164
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:38,000
transcript for the for the speech itself

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,240
before it happened but we didn't have it

166
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,310
by like by that time because it was like

167
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,039
three three weeks earlier so what we did

168
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,729
is we took the 20

169
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:50,520
13 State of the Union address transcript

170
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,849
and then we took 2013 tweets and all

171
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,169
that stuff and we started doing that

172
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,990
that data mining with that we build the

173
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,659
data visualization with this and

174
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,129
feedback was very positive like people

175
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,659
were like you know scrolling down and

176
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,430
seeing like what was happening with the

177
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,809
topic analysis and like they were

178
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:08,819
actually getting pretty interesting

179
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,490
insights from the VIS the third one was

180
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,960
like you know people were mostly saying

181
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,879
like hey would like to you know have

182
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,499
some sort of summary of the speech at

183
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:19,139
the top and what can we do and you know

184
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,029
stream graphs are very kind of

185
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,559
mainstreaming right now so it's like

186
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:23,909
well I want to try something different

187
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,979
but people didn't like it so in the end

188
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,189
we ended up building a stream graph so

189
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:31,379
this took about four to five iterations

190
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,830
within three weeks I'd say that you know

191
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,969
would recommend having a process that

192
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:40,319
even iterates more this after that was

193
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,050
turned into a paper that I presented at

194
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:49,620
I triple v's in Paris last week and yeah

195
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,349
for other examples of interesting things

196
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,949
we did with gov data is this one is

197
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:59,219
about the elections the midterm election

198
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,169
so like government and senator elections

199
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,180
and stuff like that so what we did is we

200
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,610
took all of the candidates that are on

201
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,770
Twitter and we took all the mutual

202
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,050
follows for the candidates so if one a

203
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,509
follows B&B folks a we will draw a line

204
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:15,060
with that then we will color them by

205
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,249
democrat or republican and then run this

206
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:20,249
force directed algorithm so these

207
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,709
clusters emerged from the visualization

208
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,599
algorithm it's not like we decided to

209
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,669
put these blue notes on the left and red

210
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:28,529
nodes on the right it's just like the

211
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,870
algorithm it's a physical simulation

212
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,690
right and so it ends up showing a

213
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,099
cluster on the left hand cursor on the

214
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,690
right which means that Republicans like

215
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,190
the fall Republicans and Democrats like

216
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,229
to follow Democrats and there's not much

217
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,289
communication between them and then you

218
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,449
can go and go ahead and click on one of

219
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:47,310
the candidates and see exact like the

220
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,319
exact list of all the candidates that he

221
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:52,139
follows and is followed back and you

222
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:54,690
know all the Democrat and so on but

223
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,540
always trying to maintain kind of

224
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,149
a good footprint aspect on the webpage

225
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:01,829
so this is something that you can scroll

226
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:04,290
down and we have the kind of the main

227
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,320
points that we or many insights from the

228
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,600
database so very document-oriented and

229
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,519
this is the third one that I'm not going

230
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,139
to be showing but it's not interacted or

231
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,720
20 comments a narrative database that we

232
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,029
did for the Brazil elections so the

233
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,630
other vertical is news so news is kind

234
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,459
of interesting because you need to act

235
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,319
fast it's not like you have three weeks

236
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,730
to do something because otherwise it

237
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,889
won't be news anymore right and the

238
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:36,449
other thing is that you need to be

239
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:39,870
mindful so if you take some kind of you

240
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,509
know disaster that happened somewhere

241
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,949
you need to be very conscious of like

242
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,269
you know what you're showing and what

243
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:48,660
you're not showing in this case this

244
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,230
visit that we built was during the or

245
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,569
right after the typhoon haiyan struck

246
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:58,440
the philippines and it was you know i

247
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,819
was looking at my twitter feed and

248
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:01,440
everybody was saying like hey please

249
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,620
help the philippines it sit around like

250
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,790
almost all the tweets i had on my tongue

251
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,920
and what about that so it's like well

252
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,199
this is a huge thing so let's try to

253
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,389
visualize how big it is and so what we

254
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:18,720
did is I had kind of this idea of having

255
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,220
this map that is centered on the

256
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,839
Philippines which is the main focus of

257
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,690
attention right and then try to get all

258
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,769
the different locations where the

259
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,420
geo-located tweets were happening

260
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,829
geo-located tweets that were mentioning

261
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:32,310
Philippines and help in about like 22

262
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,329
different languages and then yeah I drew

263
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:37,920
a line from each one of those locations

264
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,389
to the to the Philippines because

265
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,069
they're talking about about that and

266
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:43,560
then I run this algorithm which clusters

267
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,560
the edges so these groups edges by it's

268
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,689
not grouped by hand but it's like this

269
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,880
algorithm again creates clusters of

270
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,250
edges with in that graph and these

271
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,829
regions organically emerge from that

272
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,800
algorithm so now you can see and you can

273
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,560
use this as a navigation system and say

274
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,300
like I want to focus on the US and see

275
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,610
all the more interesting or engaging or

276
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,230
informative tweets about typhoon haiyan

277
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,540
in North America and same happen in

278
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:22,899
Europe and so on so for this it is we

279
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,510
start with like any query rectangular

280
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,970
projection of a map and then we do a

281
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,470
small thing which is just Center it on

282
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,269
the Philippines which is a small thing

283
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:33,190
but I think that it's like an important

284
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,160
thing because it puts that in the middle

285
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,660
then we just roll a straight line from

286
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,279
each one of those locations to the

287
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,079
Center of the Philippines and then we

288
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,329
run this algorithm which is called

289
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,519
multi-level agglomerative edge bundling

290
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,399
for large graphs mingle and then we

291
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,170
color-coded each one of those clusters

292
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,660
with a categorical color palette so we

293
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,149
we can easily identify all the clusters

294
00:11:58,149 --> 00:11:59,980
so up to hear that algorithm is really

295
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,209
awesome it works really fast and it's

296
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:06,970
it's it has a very clever algorithm the

297
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,560
only thing is that when you bundle all

298
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,570
these edges together into one group the

299
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,730
resulting edge is also one pixel width

300
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,699
width which is not you know this the

301
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,829
thing you'd like because it means that

302
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:19,570
it doesn't really take into account the

303
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,870
the weight of each bundle so we extended

304
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,699
this algorithm so that I would would it

305
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:29,290
would take into account bundle weight

306
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,089
and it would take into account like

307
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:34,180
direct directed edges and we open

308
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,140
sourced this we have a great open source

309
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,850
team that always want us to open source

310
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,010
as much as possible so that was actually

311
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,339
pretty easy to do so we have kind of

312
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,709
like a kitchen sink for that here this

313
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,060
is the example you can choose the number

314
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,550
of neighbors to cluster so this means

315
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,390
that you know this will if you put more

316
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,250
neighbors there will be less clusters

317
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,339
were with more edges basically and what

318
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:01,990
you can interpolate here is between the

319
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,120
initial state of straight lines to the

320
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,490
bundle edges you can play a bit with the

321
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,949
margin which is the stuff we added to to

322
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:10,209
have this kind of like bundle weight

323
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:13,540
being taken care of you can color by

324
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,610
cluster as i showed before or you can

325
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,149
call x direction so in this case edges

326
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:20,380
that start from a bloop

327
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,390
point to a red point are like the

328
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,640
direction the direction is encoded in

329
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,000
that so here it's not very easy to see

330
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,240
how many edges are going from one place

331
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,420
to the other and vice versa so what we

332
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,870
did also is we extended the algorithm to

333
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,220
sort a bit the edges when you're

334
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,140
creating the bundles to group the edges

335
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,430
going from one direction to the other

336
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,430
and so now it's a bit easier to see that

337
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,930
about half of the edges are going from

338
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:55,720
one place to the other and so on yeah so

339
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,220
on sports the audience for sport is like

340
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,350
pretty geeky right it's like they always

341
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,870
like to know the exact stats and goals

342
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,330
and like yellow cards and so on so we

343
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,560
had a lot of fun during the World Cup

344
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,890
with this this this interactive

345
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,870
visualization that was built what by one

346
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,550
of the people in our team cryst it's

347
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,140
pretty amazing because it's an

348
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,970
exploratory visualization I'll give you

349
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,380
all the matches during the World Cup

350
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,620
with all the tweets per minute during

351
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,080
each match and I will show you how those

352
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,330
correlate with each one of the goals so

353
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,800
here you can see during a match how

354
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,290
those correlate with specific goals and

355
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,860
you can scroll down and see all the

356
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,540
matches you can see how many tweets

357
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,340
happen during each match you can see how

358
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,200
many goals we had you can see how many

359
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,020
yellow cards red cards and so on and

360
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,210
also you can do is just like select a

361
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,460
team and follow the path of that team

362
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:02,290
during the entire tournament another

363
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,210
interesting database that we did with

364
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,000
this was and that really shows the kind

365
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,120
of like global aspect of the platform is

366
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:17,110
this one so what we did is basically you

367
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,450
know we we had this hash flags during

368
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,440
the World Cup you know that a

369
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,530
three-letter country code that you could

370
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,120
use with the hashtag and this will give

371
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,460
you the flag of the country right so if

372
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,410
you put like hashtag a rj r g you'd see

373
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,200
the the Argentine flag so we use the

374
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,880
hash flags we know that for example

375
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,830
argentina will use allure of the

376
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,350
argentine hash flag right but what is

377
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,480
the second country most mentioned by by

378
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,220
people in Argentina or what is the

379
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,690
second country was mentioned by France

380
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,240
or by the US and so on and so we started

381
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,750
analyzing bad to see interesting

382
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,250
relationships with these countries so

383
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,020
for example if you go to Argentina you

384
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,540
might see that countries that mention

385
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,020
Argentina the most are Nigeria and you

386
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,339
can see the list on the left basically

387
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:07,839
and on the right or the country's being

388
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,550
mentioned by Argentina Argentina has

389
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,710
been mentioning Brazil Colombia is the

390
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:15,040
second most and so on so what's

391
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,580
interesting is that we started seeing a

392
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,110
lot of interesting immigration part of

393
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,450
patterns so for example if you click on

394
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,110
the USA well Iran talks a lot about the

395
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,330
USA but the other thing is that on the

396
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,260
right the USA the country most mentioned

397
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,210
by your USA is Mexico and and this kind

398
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,310
of tells you that there's no not only

399
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,980
one voice in the u.s. just like rooting

400
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,450
for the US but they're like multiple

401
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,670
communities and the biggest one after

402
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,160
the the company you know the one that

403
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,630
roots for the USA is the one that roots

404
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,050
for Mexico and so on same happens with

405
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,900
France for example you see a lot of

406
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,310
likes french-speaking countries like

407
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,380
Cote d'Ivoire Ivory Coast and

408
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,200
Switzerland and Nigeria maybe that talk

409
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,449
about France and then France the first

410
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,280
one you know most mention countries

411
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,140
Algeria and kind of like also tells you

412
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,459
a lot about immigration within France

413
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:15,280
and also you can see proximity so for

414
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,990
example croatia and bosnia and

415
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,939
herzegovina are like really close to

416
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,010
each other right and so you have the

417
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,630
country most measuring both you and

418
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,760
herzegovina croatia and then Croatia's

419
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,080
the country most mentioned by

420
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:35,050
bosnia-herzegovina all right so I've

421
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,210
been showing SVG to the canvas kind of

422
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,190
stuff one is one is interesting to use

423
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,100
WebGL so maybe when you have a lot of

424
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,420
elements to render that's for

425
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,130
exploratory data visualization but also

426
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,640
when you have a story to tell

427
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,200
or when you want to use like kind of

428
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,310
like the cool factor so for example we

429
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,020
did this visualization for Cannes Lions

430
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,630
so this was part of a deck and the

431
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,250
visualization was exploring mentions of

432
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,430
ian mckellen and sir patrick stewart and

433
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,890
mentions of both users through time and

434
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,600
so the main idea was kind of like to

435
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,100
show the correlations of like you know

436
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,130
how how the relationship we do this to

437
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,220
actors came to be and so we correlated

438
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,470
this with you know a trip they made to

439
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,060
new york city in which like they were

440
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,260
working on a play together and then also

441
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,550
towards the end they were also talking

442
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,810
or mentioning there were mentions of

443
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,880
both a lot too because they were kind of

444
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,650
like promoting the latest like x-men

445
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,540
video and so you can see kind of

446
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,280
correlations of those things so this is

447
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,710
more like for impact or kind of like I

448
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,470
eye candy or I call it data illustration

449
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,750
as opposed to data visualization or data

450
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,110
journalism the other thing is maybe if

451
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,730
you want to make interactive experiences

452
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,830
and we build this for CES and South by

453
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,990
Southwest and so this is built from

454
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,870
scratch we already knew which machine we

455
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,700
were targeting and so we started working

456
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,650
with WebGL and like implementing from

457
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,940
scratch all the touch event and

458
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,920
multi-touch stuff and so we built this

459
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,290
globe in which you can kind of filter

460
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,540
tweets for example by a keyword South by

461
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,520
Southwest twist and you can swipe

462
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,320
through the different tweets and that

463
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,300
will correlate with the tweets on the

464
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,890
globe so there are like two linked

465
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,190
visualizations there if you zoom in or

466
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,460
you do that type of stuff we worked also

467
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,700
on having this expanded to be a plane

468
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,110
from a globe and then you could zoom in

469
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,120
with both fingers and kind of pan around

470
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,470
and so this was like a very fun

471
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,840
interactive experience not very kind of

472
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,810
insightful but super fun and people were

473
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,550
like kind of hooked and using their by

474
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,260
the way there's a book called WebGL

475
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,170
insights and write in a chapter on that

476
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,280
definitely recommend you to check that

477
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,150
out and yeah we talked about things like

478
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,850
this temperature anomalies data

479
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,770
visualization which this one is using

480
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,780
NASA imagery to kind of show the

481
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,820
differences in temperature in the world

482
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,440
so if you see around like for example

483
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,559
1900 it's it's pretty

484
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,919
mild but if you go to 90s or even like

485
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,049
2000s you can see that there's like a

486
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,360
huge change in temperature anomalies so

487
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,350
this means that the temperature is

488
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:18,409
growing more than 33 degrees I won't

489
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:21,769
show this so key takeaways so if there's

490
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:23,659
one thing you need to kind of remember

491
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:25,940
after this talk is the audience the

492
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,620
audience determines the verticals we're

493
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,450
focusing on it determines the tone of

494
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,759
your data visualization and it ends up

495
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,710
determining also the standards you're

496
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,139
using because for example a touareg we

497
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:37,879
have more than half of the people just

498
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:39,590
like logging with their mobile phones so

499
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,299
what phones are they're using what are

500
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:42,529
the best standards you use for those

501
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:47,149
phones etc and yeah I just recommend you

502
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:48,379
to check that out interactive the

503
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,289
turtlecom that's my Twitter handle
