1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530

okay sorry but those technical details

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,170
are difficulties ER and okay so that's

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:12,120
in black commute and yeah cool okay so

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,860
hi everyone and my name is John breath

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,890
has been mentioned and those no details

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,390
sort of our twitter and get off of

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,100
anyone once again touch me after this i

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,240
was curious about anything to talk about

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,390
and so about me i'm a lead engineer the

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,080
company called d 4-h technologies and

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,760
we've recently adopted happy and what I

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,199
want to talk today was about how that

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,660
adoption is gone and how we actually

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,829
came to use it in some of the design

15
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,660
decisions we made around it and yeah so

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,280
I'm pretty sure no no no one has ever

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,899
heard of d fresh technologies were small

18
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,719
company based at a Dublin and so just a

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,010
real quick intro on what we do just say

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,350
you've sort of context and so basically

21
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,930
okay the resolution is great there but

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,120
those are our customers we work in the

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,309
emergency services and response team

24
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,160
industry so what we do is provide

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,449
software to help these guys do their

26
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,129
jobs which is save lives and they range

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,990
from anywhere from charity search and

28
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,000
rescue teams to public fire service or

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,460
city hazmat teams and alder up to a

30
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,140
private island gas and unsafe

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,189
pharmaceuticals and so we give team

32
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,960
software tools to help them do her job

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,000
to the best rivoli so when it comes to

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,680
tracking equipment so inspections

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,990
repairs my engine inventories their

36
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,420
personnel who's qualified who's I am

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,640
trained who's on call and we give them

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,200
like structured incident reporting sort

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,689
of federal analytics and integrate with

40
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,820
like lost lost person data bases around

41
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,340
the world and so with the goal of like

42
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,329
giving them the right date of when

43
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,820
things go wrong and I'm you do that all

44
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,590
from here so that's actually a light i

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,340
was on the coast of dublin and taken

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,049
from an irish coast guard helicopter so

47
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,520
it's a pretty cool place to work on

48
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,369
happy yeah and so we're going to talk

49
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,049
today was basically about how we came to

50
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,060
use happy in her stock and some design

51
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,450
choices we made an her first venture wit

52
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,549
node went all together and the part

53
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,390
happy played in that and so voy happy so

54
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,860
talk to you down sir that I have to

55
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,020
start with why node I'm up until about

56
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,810
six months ago

57
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,290
we were actually a fully PHP company and

58
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,510
so typical Lance taco base a large

59
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,370
monolithic server side rendering and

60
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,700
then a custom frame work on top and but

61
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,380
year we wanted to build a public API so

62
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,090
for mobile apps and customer

63
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,530
integrations and you know improved

64
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,099
development for ourselves and so try to

65
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,330
move forward with the code base and

66
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,459
trying to build that API and it's clear

67
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:37,750
is going to slow us down in the long run

68
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,580
in terms like maintainability and things

69
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,340
and so we looked elsewhere he would

70
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,440
order PHP frameworks like improve the

71
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,140
situation moving forward and then we

72
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,880
also investigated other languages and

73
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,260
obviously landed on node it's like

74
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,700
seeing all the success stories of like

75
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,980
Walmart and paypal and their adoption

76
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,620
stories and so we build a prototype to

77
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,900
compare with like the pH vapi prototype

78
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,150
we had and we did originally and Express

79
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,870
actually but and even without like the

80
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,700
PHP code reuse for problems we solved

81
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,610
already and we're able to replicate the

82
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,040
PHP API concept pretty quickly and in

83
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,810
much less no code but I think that's

84
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,030
what everyone finds the hood n p.m. in

85
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,319
the node ecosystem able to do things

86
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,019
pretty quick and so obviously notice way

87
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,180
forward and we wanted before with that

88
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,410
so and the prototype was prototyping

89
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,390
best as there's a lot learned but

90
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,880
there's a huge went wrong with it that

91
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,000
was going to cost us moving forward and

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,260
so the next step is to look at our

93
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,180
choice of frameworks and see what would

94
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,400
scale first I think expressed is a great

95
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,440
framework put some design aspects that

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,180
we weren't convinced with suit like a

97
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,780
larger scale API in project and unless

98
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,549
we built extra infrastructure and we

99
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:49,870
didn't have the resources or experience

100
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,810
to do that and some design issues what

101
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,889
expressed you're not into like the

102
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,569
router and like the flexibility it

103
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,880
offers is great but I'm like not being

104
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,620
able to guarantee your handler call

105
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,090
order and so far out and we've seen some

106
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,530
companies get burned without recently

107
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,139
and I'm it always felt like we're

108
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,730
working against it to try keep things

109
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,100
modular and so we spent some time

110
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,870
evaluating other options and there

111
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,430
looked at loads of great frameworks a

112
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,079
note and I could spend a talk like

113
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,549
talking about how they compare with

114
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:17,019
happy but you just have to trust me when

115
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,609
I say we looked extensively and found

116
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,320
the happy was the one that met our needs

117
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,280
the best and so happy is a lot of

118
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,360
bragging rights but I wanted to talk

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,099
about what influenced our decision to

120
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:27,740
choose it

121
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,139
and a first of all the routing was like

122
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,210
deterministic and which is brilliant

123
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,430
like for larger scale projects and it's

124
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,530
kind of essential them because you don't

125
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,669
always get to know the project as a

126
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:40,699
whole and the enterprise grades like one

127
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:41,960
hundred percent test coverage and

128
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,970
streaks ember adherence like we can't

129
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,590
afford to make mistakes in the industry

130
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,530
were in so the the robustus was a like a

131
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,380
first priority for us and the plugin api

132
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,449
is premiering favorite feature and happy

133
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,080
and it provided the infrastructure i

134
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,090
felt was missing other frameworks and

135
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,889
trying to keep coal-based clean and

136
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:02,960
scale well and gives all your cold

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,190
contacts and i talked about that in a

138
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,940
minute and a few examples i'm they let

139
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,800
you focus on building business value

140
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,120
instead of rebuilding the same

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,300
infrastructure every time and the

142
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,460
ecosystem is great all the plugins / the

143
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,349
happy team and other people but i won't

144
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:19,580
go into that I think simulator speakers

145
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,620
are going to cover some of those and I'm

146
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,090
I definitely what I mentioned the

147
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,729
community and its really inclusive and

148
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:28,069
encouraging to beginners and my first no

149
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,620
module was a happy module and this is my

150
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,030
first conference talk it's you can

151
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,880
probably tell from nerves but I'm and

152
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,020
that's a result like like guys like

153
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,080
behind in the mentoring and a system to

154
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,380
got in there and so some of the design

155
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,330
choices we made you're unhappy and there

156
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,979
are heavily influenced by the MPN and

157
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:50,690
they're like fostered service toil and

158
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,599
so happy CLI like in how we structured I

159
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:57,590
building this application and so after a

160
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,060
few different attempts and like trying

161
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,289
to structure things so that they would

162
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:01,729
scale quite well because we expected

163
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,680
this API to go pretty big our platforms

164
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,659
pretty big and the range of features we

165
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:08,300
offer and so so one of the problems

166
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,280
we're going to pep hates i have about

167
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,560
like a lot of node applications is like

168
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,900
500 line index file we've like huge

169
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,060
amounts code with no context and it's

170
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,569
hard to grasp at a first attempt alright

171
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:21,710
so you wanted to keep that clean from

172
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,750
start and so first I anything that

173
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,190
wasn't config or like plugin

174
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,650
registration into a plugin and so it

175
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,750
gives you a nice neat starting place and

176
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,159
then everything inside the plugin gives

177
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,650
a context and then the plugins were

178
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,210
ready to divide it into a service or a

179
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,070
feature so like a service plugin will be

180
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,719
like catering from some sort of service

181
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,880
like database access

182
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,830
are you know authentication or and stuff

183
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,270
like that and the feature was the

184
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,590
business logic that would be offering

185
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,240
customers like your membership sir

186
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,230
equipment just management or something

187
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,570
like that and they would contain the

188
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,190
model functionality as well as the root

189
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,840
and logic and then they would expose

190
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,130
their own functionality for another

191
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,050
plug-in to consume I'll explain that in

192
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,620
minocqua code I am and and they could

193
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,200
consume an order if needed I know

194
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
everything else we said we pushed into

195
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,990
node modulus not this would be excellent

196
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,820
we'll have loads of node modules to my

197
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,320
name and the D 4-h name and all but

198
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,090
there was surprisingly few and I think

199
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,200
that says a lot about the nobody

200
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,450
consistent and the happy ecosystem is

201
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,160
all and so sure what that looks like and

202
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,500
so this is a new happy eight syntax and

203
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,460
that's pretty straightforward you'd

204
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,050
require a happy module create your

205
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,590
server taking some config and you got a

206
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,210
connection this is new top eh so it's

207
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,410
basically a listener and we just sees a

208
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,560
clear yet I am you pass the report I

209
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,150
won't go into that everything's going to

210
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,080
talk about some of the happy eight

211
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,900
features later and then we just add in

212
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,610
our plug-in registration so you can see

213
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,740
pretty clearly like all your code is

214
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,450
context now you can understand what it

215
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,420
does not this big giant index file to

216
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,090
Troy digest and what it would you like

217
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,280
I'm not used to production code looking

218
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,490
at clean and so I'd show you what like a

219
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,290
sample feature plugin would look like

220
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,570
and since we are we generally like our

221
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,090
member plugin and such as the normal

222
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,830
plugin registration tree parameters

223
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,080
plugins like a server a li so anything

224
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,610
you can do it server you can do in a

225
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,290
plug-in but some sound box features

226
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,150
which are pretty cool the options to be

227
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,500
passed in when you're registering and

228
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,000
next just returns the control flow back

229
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,210
to the server and this is an example of

230
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,980
consuming one of the plugins so we're

231
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,050
consuming some database access here nice

232
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,670
clean API to do and it will fail the

233
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,960
compile time if there's any issue so

234
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,210
you're not testing things at runtime and

235
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,310
then we are in our model functionality

236
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,960
don't like come from an ORM or something

237
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,820
you're older self and we passed in the

238
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,370
database area so i made testing easier

239
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,380
when we're testing her at a model logic

240
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,440
and this is how we expose the

241
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,480
functionality so another plugin could

242
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,190
consume it so pretty straight forward

243
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,400
again

244
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,170
and there's a route so sorry just a lot

245
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,070
of code at once for there and so that

246
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,780
that's a standard route definition there

247
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,160
and like I think it's pretty self

248
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,370
documenting and I won't go into

249
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,660
validation I think someone's going to

250
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,340
talk about joy specifically later but

251
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,280
and you can see here like the the query

252
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,010
parameter pretty like self documenting

253
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,280
and free hunter gets called next Frank

254
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,170
you know checks we might want to do but

255
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,580
I think handler needs to be like

256
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,200
highlighted for how simple it is to read

257
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,570
and what it does and we use promises and

258
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,810
I don't they work for us for her

259
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,250
handling i think is always a debate

260
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,700
around and calibrate was on the modules

261
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,860
roll ourselves like gives her uniform

262
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,960
jason outputs it worked pretty cool

263
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,360
because and a if there was a Boomer it

264
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,340
would just return that it is but if not

265
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,580
it would wrap it and so we'd always have

266
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,500
a sinner output and then over past year

267
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,630
to like New Relic or monitoring tool so

268
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,550
if there was ever a problem that would

269
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,230
just really no return 500 s with the

270
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,460
server would crash and that's one of the

271
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,310
cool things about happy and descriptions

272
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,610
are straightforward and so just one more

273
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,530
feature to show then like on top of that

274
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,090
we're back to a server example and we

275
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,460
have one extra plugin and this is happy

276
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,080
swagger so it's kind of like light would

277
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,340
be so self documenting and but but it

278
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,660
actually traits fog or documentation

279
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,820
which is pretty interactive for anyone

280
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,320
not familiar with saira it generates

281
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,200
documentation that looks like this and

282
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,700
so generates a jason specification is

283
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,580
API enables interactive documentation

284
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,280
generation on the page and then a

285
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,650
sandbox there for anyone to test and

286
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,990
this was huge for customers and had like

287
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,730
when trying to build integrations with

288
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,800
us and it even goes one step further you

289
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,270
can actually have your client generate

290
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,100
or your client SDKs generated from this

291
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,940
in like Java or PHP or java script and

292
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,170
so it's pretty cool that were one root

293
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,760
definition you've got your documentation

294
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,920
on client SDKs generated a compile-time

295
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,230
with no bill stuff so that was huge for

296
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,420
us moving forward so and saw results and

297
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,490
with an API in production and we started

298
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,990
in the summer with naveen production

299
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,790
supporting our first mobile app also in

300
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,940
production and some cool parts with you

301
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,209
know

302
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:08,279
regular handling input validations were

303
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,949
usable and reliable and no manual docs

304
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:13,379
maintain or client api's codes modular

305
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,480
scales quite well and and it's changed

306
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,029
our approach development now so new

307
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,879
Filch new features a built API first

308
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,529
we've actually seen customers now start

309
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,540
building their own API or their own apps

310
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,079
over which is pretty cool c and c ya

311
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,300
things to take away and load adoption

312
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,980
can work even with small teams and small

313
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,259
resources I prototype a small use case

314
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,209
first I would just throw error code base

315
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,519
that we have and enjoy your place with

316
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,350
one and when you do definitely use happy

317
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,029
it worked great for us and I don't think

318
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:46,619
we were to move forward and we're gonna

319
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,860
get our framework is the same pace and

320
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,699
uncertainty funny ones using happy

321
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:52,199
definitely talk to me curious to see how

322
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,639
you build things with it or if you

323
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,029
different design approaches and so I'm

324
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,499
done all finished with another picture

325
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:00,269
of our lighthouse and thanks very much

326
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:02,399
for the happy team for inviting me over

327
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,959
to speak on this and I thanks everyone
