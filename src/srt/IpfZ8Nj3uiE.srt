10
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,960
thank you so much that was a really

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,899
sweet intro thanks for coming to my talk

12
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,180
I know that this is towards the end of

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,100
the day I've heard many naps have been

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,129
taken this afternoon so for those who

15
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:41,410
came back from their naps to join thank

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,380
you so much I'm very excited to take you

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,260
through an introduction hopefully as

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:55,690
gently as I can to web USB so I did

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,370
actually have an alternative title for

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,560
this and if you want to know the meaning

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,170
behind it I will explain to you after

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,000
this at the after party but what it

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,110
really wanted to color was how do you

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,689
send a singer and in this the browser

25
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:10,570
because that definitely has a little bit

26
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,869
of relevancy web USB but before I just

27
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:15,400
wanted to introduce myself super quickly

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,460
if you don't know of me my name is Suze

29
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:18,970
Hinton

30
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,790
I am new cat or no up cat on the

31
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,500
internet you can say it either way it's

32
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,760
definitely okay to say it either way I

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,159
work on open source IOT libraries in my

34
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,750
spare time a lot of them are in

35
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,760
JavaScript which is why I'm here today

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,280
if you came to the node bots workshop

37
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,320
yesterday thank you I was really happy

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,929
to see you there it was really fun

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,740
you saw me really badly explaining

40
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,090
certain components in the morning so

41
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,040
that was a lot of fun but during the day

42
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,250
I do have to Anna celery in order to pay

43
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,170
my rent so I am in developer relations

44
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,780
at Microsoft and I actually do focus on

45
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,780
I would say that too but it's more

46
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,090
security based and IOT in the cloud and

47
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,500
a lot of enterprise stuff as well so if

48
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,670
you're really interested to talk to me

49
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,110
about that later - he couldn also come

50
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,479
up to me I wanted to also think that

51
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,610
organizers you may have noticed that I'm

52
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,489
was not originally on the schedule so I

53
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,730
was asked to give this talk a week ago

54
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,920
so it just bear with me because some of

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,540
the demos are a little rough to you so

56
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,900
I'll explain that later on as well so

57
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,880
it's today's aim is to help you see the

58
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,320
browser and the web in a different way

59
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,090
I've definitely seen a lot of talks at

60
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,800
this conference so far that are along

61
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,030
those lines which i think is really

62
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,910
really cool and I want you to not be

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,490
scared of hardware and microcontrollers

64
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,260
because if I can hustle this in like

65
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,020
less than a week then you can definitely

66
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,580
do it it might take a little bit longer

67
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,390
if you're a beginner but the world of

68
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,520
hardware is getting ever and ever closer

69
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,320
to browsers and that's why I'm really

70
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,470
excited to tell you about that today so

71
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,640
the topics were actually going to cover

72
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,340
just a history of like web and devices

73
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,260
and how we've been like attempting to

74
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,540
clumsily smash them together in the past

75
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,650
what web USB is how to use web USB and

76
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,270
then like maybe some kind of futures

77
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,310
stuff that I'm hoping to see and how you

78
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,380
can kind of help provide a future for it

79
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,040
as well so first of all history of web

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,320
USB and when I beam by that is like

81
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,840
somehow being able to put browses and

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,390
like devices like arduino x' and drones

83
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,280
and boats and things like that together

84
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,740
in the past so we do actually have to go

85
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,730
as far back as 2007 to 2009 that was

86
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,670
when I first started getting into

87
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,160
hardware and trying to sort of make

88
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,290
really cool machines but also like talk

89
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,300
to it with my browser and so the way

90
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,070
that you did it back then was use flash

91
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,960
communication server does anyone use

92
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,170
that yeah a couple of us were certain to

93
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,350
be in the minority and you use this

94
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,120
really cool app called serve proxy and

95
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,709
what it would do is it would take the

96
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,140
serial port data coming in from like

97
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,540
something like an Arduino and it would

98
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,010
then like proxy that on to like

99
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,660
basically like a socket so that you

100
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,010
could actually listen to the data coming

101
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,170
in in your browser or in flash which is

102
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,130
really really interesting

103
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,890
so you would have your Arduino and your

104
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,050
browser but that was so far apart

105
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,610
because you had to have all these steps

106
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,739
in between right so you had so proxy

107
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,040
which would go from serial to TCP so

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,150
that you could then use flash

109
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,280
communication server and make a flash

110
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,290
app to listen to that so I think the

111
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,990
first example I ever did was I had like

112
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,630
a a trim pot like a little knob that you

113
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,700
could turn plugged into the Arduino and

114
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,800
when you turned it there was like a

115
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,770
circle colored in with a color in flat

116
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,650
and as you as you turn the knob it would

117
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,150
either change the cycle through all the

118
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,650
colors or it would change the shape of

119
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,870
the circle and I thought I was a wizard

120
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,009
basically if the code did not look much

121
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,289
like what a wizard would write there was

122
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:54,940
a really weird configuration file that

123
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,639
you used in so proxy where you had to

124
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,270
put lots of nerdy things like the baud

125
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,580
rate and all your stop bits and parity

126
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,080
and things like that but the flash

127
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,509
communication stuff in action script is

128
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,550
pretty readable you know you can kind of

129
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,199
see what's happening and so it was

130
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,520
actually pretty friendly once you

131
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,009
actually got that data coming through

132
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:18,190
but we all know what happened with flash

133
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,389
it fell out of vogue for like very you

134
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,550
know understandable reasons and I agree

135
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,310
with a lot of those reasons and so sadly

136
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,050
I sort of had to put that method down

137
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,690
and it was really uncool for a while for

138
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,190
me to say that I used to be a flash

139
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,759
developer for my day job so we fast

140
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,419
forward to 2013 to 2017 and we got this

141
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,610
really cool thing in the Chrome browser

142
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,000
called chrome serial and just wanted to

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,889
just quickly like before everyone gets

144
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,139
excited just to give a little bit of a

145
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,819
rest and peace there so explain what

146
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:55,150
happens later okay so let's start with

147
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,469
that scenario again you know we've got a

148
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,060
load we know and we desperately want our

149
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,830
browser to like start controlling it and

150
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,349
showing data and stuff like that so what

151
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:03,520
we would do is we would use Chrome

152
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,159
serial which was an API that allowed us

153
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:09,340
to access the the actual like serial

154
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,110
communication that was built into our

155
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,180
dueño boards or any other hardware that

156
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,800
had like a serial port that we could

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,159
connect to and then the only way that we

158
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,440
could actually use that API was it was

159
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,960
sort of sandboxed into you I either had

160
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,870
to have a chrome app and it had to sort

161
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,210
of run in there so for a while there

162
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,830
were like really cool things coming out

163
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,900
where you had a website but you also had

164
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,699
to kind of install the companion app and

165
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,979
it was a little bit clunky but I was

166
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,330
able to sort of demonstrate some of my

167
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,250
hardware libraries working within that

168
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,469
and some people went on to kind of use

169
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,860
my libraries to make really cool stuff

170
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,389
and one example that I really really

171
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,729
loved was the chip computer which some

172
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,139
of you might have seen on Kickstarter a

173
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,539
few years ago it was a $9

174
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:56,139
Linux computer and when you actually got

175
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,180
it in the mail you know it takes a while

176
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,520
as we know with Kickstarter's I used to

177
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,120
work there so I definitely I think I've

178
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,080
backed one hundred and thirtysomething

179
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,199
things who knows there they had this

180
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,460
really cool chrome app that when you

181
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,949
plug in your chip you know you could

182
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,469
just go and install this app and run it

183
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:15,699
in your browser and then you could

184
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:17,199
update the firmware in there and I was

185
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,569
like wow this hardware interface here

186
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,550
looks SuperDuper friendly it just

187
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,349
doesn't look scary like those weird

188
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:24,759
malware looking apps that you normally

189
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,520
have to download you know you know it's

190
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,439
so like update just like this one simple

191
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,210
thing and so you know if you're a hobby

192
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,589
collector of however you have all of

193
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:34,449
these ridiculous applications just

194
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:36,789
littered in your all over your hard

195
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,409
drive and you use them once and you just

196
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,779
never you forget about them so I think

197
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:42,310
at one point I had like six different

198
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,409
versions of the Arduino IDE running four

199
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:48,249
different machines that only required a

200
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:49,839
certain version so it's a nightmare

201
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,479
but speaking of Arduino and I know that

202
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,939
there's Arduino people here I caught up

203
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:57,129
with them earlier it's really cool do we

204
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:58,930
know actually went and created this app

205
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,689
that it's basically a living chrome app

206
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,120
that runs on Chrome OS devices which

207
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,979
means that you can program Arduino

208
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:09,069
boards now in the browser with a full

209
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,259
IDE and then you can compile and upload

210
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,779
that onto the board and that's using

211
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:15,339
Chrome serial and I thought that was so

212
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:18,099
so very cool and their Arduino create

213
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:20,919
platform is just like genius I just

214
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,360
actually think it's a better experience

215
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,969
than the normal audrina ID which has

216
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:26,349
been around for a while which was sort

217
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:29,409
of like based on the processing ID and

218
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,389
cool fact like they actually used my

219
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:33,550
software or at least they they have been

220
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,079
in the past you notice to flash the

221
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,940
Arduino so that was really awesome to

222
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,889
kind of see my stuff like browser fired

223
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:40,899
up a web packed or whatever and and put

224
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:43,240
into a chrome app but you can kind of

225
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,370
sense that that's a limitation like only

226
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,380
being able to run that on a Chrome App

227
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,389
just doesn't mean that you know it's

228
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:52,569
available to everybody so you know it

229
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:55,089
wasn't an official website either again

230
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:56,680
as I said it only worked in Chrome apps

231
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,660
which is a pretty narrow ecosystem these

232
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,790
days because they've sunset chrome apps

233
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,800
for just browsers and it only works when

234
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,590
Chrome OS and so that happened in

235
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,150
20:17 and there were a lot of really

236
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,250
really really really sad no buts people

237
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,550
that yeah so and so yes so that brings

238
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,010
us to today and what we've been kind of

239
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,430
doing up until web USB which is browsers

240
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,370
and web sockets so who went to the the

241
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,800
was it the smartphone Symphony earlier

242
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,080
yeah it was pretty cool wasn't it yeah

243
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,360
so we do the same thing with hardware

244
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,450
where we use WebSockets and we have like

245
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,760
a node server running you know on our

246
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,340
laptop and then we have our browser and

247
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,770
our back-end kind of node server is

248
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,830
speaking by a serial to the Arduino it

249
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,300
could be johnny-five or something like

250
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,910
that and then it's sending just like

251
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,620
messages through to the browser and the

252
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,270
browser can also send messages back so

253
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,190
it's just like your own kind of invented

254
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,990
protocol for figuring out how to like

255
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,880
you know how that two-way communication

256
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,730
and that works okay because I feel like

257
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,160
there's less distance between the

258
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,350
Arduino and the browser in this case and

259
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,020
we are writing JavaScript the whole way

260
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,960
too which is helpful but again you can

261
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,700
still see that there's just a few steps

262
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,920
in order to get going

263
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,900
you can alternatively package all of

264
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,760
this up into something like an electron

265
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,780
app or an N wjs app this is a piece of

266
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,340
software I made for a Kickstarter

267
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,610
project a while ago the the project is

268
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,080
called the public radio it is a radio in

269
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,930
a mason jar and it is a monogamous radio

270
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,150
where you can only listen to one radio

271
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,430
station

272
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,269
and so you can imagine people like I

273
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:41,089
changed my mind you know I'm I'm ready

274
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,220
to break up with NPR and I want to

275
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,139
listen to something else so you know

276
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,639
they had to offer some software in order

277
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,079
to like change the radio station right

278
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,579
and if you moved countries then you

279
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:50,779
would have to update the band or the

280
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,639
frequency or like you know radio is very

281
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,230
complicated if you've ever checked out

282
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,660
the Wikipedia page and so I created this

283
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,579
kind of proof of concept electron app

284
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:00,259
for them but it was like a hundred

285
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,089
megabytes so download just to change

286
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,769
this radio station and I'm like I'm just

287
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:06,170
contributing to the detritus of one off

288
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,939
apps that are like living on people's

289
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,589
hard drives and it just didn't feel

290
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:12,139
right but this was I was like I can feel

291
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,759
it I can smell it was so close to being

292
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,439
able to use web technologies you know

293
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,750
with node in it and JavaScript and it

294
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,319
feels good and even you can technically

295
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:24,620
use Arduino to create on you know a

296
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,860
computer other than a chrome book but it

297
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,779
does still have to run like a background

298
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,759
app that runs in your tray that kind of

299
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,009
is able to listen on a socket to be able

300
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:39,139
to kind of flash your Arduino so it's

301
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,120
again a better experience than the

302
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,149
Arduino ID but it's still having this

303
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:46,040
like coupling in between right and

304
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,779
that's as you can tell from the theme of

305
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,490
this that's what's been frustrating a

306
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,220
lot of us this whole time so now we kind

307
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,930
of see some of the problems that we've

308
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,519
had in the past which you might not have

309
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,589
actually been part of if you haven't

310
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:59,149
done hobby before hopefully that helps

311
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,819
you understand why web USB now is such a

312
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:03,050
big deal

313
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,139
and just to let you know I will remind

314
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,110
you of this later Web USB is a an

315
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,360
implementation of a different type of

316
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,130
communication than serial it's just that

317
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,290
you know Sarah was kind of like what we

318
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,230
had before this so come and see me if

319
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,339
you want to sort of know about the

320
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,949
differences of them later on so I'm

321
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,660
gonna be pulling from the web USB spec a

322
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,220
lot because I think that this spec is

323
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,209
extremely unique in that it has human

324
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:32,000
readable paragraphs and information in

325
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,290
it and I think it's really well written

326
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,990
and one of the main authors Riley I had

327
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,370
the pleasure of like he knows speaking

328
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,689
back and forth with on the internet

329
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:40,550
recently and that's something that he

330
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,829
deeply cares about and so I definitely

331
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,809
this is one of the only times I'm going

332
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:46,370
to encourage you to check out a spec

333
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,230
because I think it's really great so I'm

334
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,279
going to just like pull the main

335
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,850
messaging

336
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,040
from it so you can understand so the web

337
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,709
USB API provides a way to safely expose

338
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:58,130
USB to vice services to the web it's

339
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,860
pretty straightforward what's cool is

340
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,720
that it provides an API familiar to

341
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,430
developers who have used existing native

342
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,279
USB libraries and exposes the device

343
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,110
interfaces defined by existing

344
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,389
specifications so what I like about this

345
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,920
is rather than just reinventing the

346
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,180
wheel and saying well we're going to use

347
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,949
USB but we're gonna have our own thing

348
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:17,959
and we're gonna like invent this thing

349
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:19,790
for the JavaScript community they just

350
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,130
basically said we're a Melissa you know

351
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,630
device manufacturers we're aiming this

352
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,800
at people who already know what this

353
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,620
stuff is if we just use the same specs

354
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,209
then it's probably got a better chance

355
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,730
of success and it's going to be you know

356
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,290
it's it's cross-platform knowledge I

357
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,410
think that's really really cool it is a

358
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,120
little harder to learn as a result but

359
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,740
it just means that that knowledge can

360
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,259
actually be portable to other platforms

361
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:43,759
such as just writing like you know on

362
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,259
the bare operating system which is kind

363
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:45,709
of cool

364
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:48,560
so again web USB is different to serial

365
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,699
they're just different ways of

366
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,250
interfacing with devices web USB is more

367
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,410
like the lower-level stuff that most

368
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,199
professionally manufactured devices know

369
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,750
how to speak that being said it's not

370
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,199
you know super mega complex to learn so

371
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,970
why is web USB better than all of this

372
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,310
stuff that I offered you know as

373
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,579
solutions to you just before so the

374
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,019
first thing that I really like about it

375
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,970
is that there is a permission based

376
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,050
model here and so if somebody plugs in a

377
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,779
device and they go to a website in order

378
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,550
to connect directly to the button the

379
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,209
device via Web USB they actually have to

380
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:27,949
give that permission so it's very

381
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:31,040
similar to a webcam or your microphone

382
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,040
or your location I really like that and

383
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,750
you can actually kind of provide filters

384
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,430
so that you're only sort of showing your

385
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,990
device and they don't have to pick from

386
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,180
a list of weird random stuff that

387
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,009
they've plugged into their computer so I

388
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:44,800
think that's really accessible there I

389
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
think one of the best features is that

390
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,290
as soon as you plug in a web USB device

391
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,089
you have the option to provide a

392
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:56,630
descriptive on your device that is

393
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,519
advertised when it's plugged in and its

394
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,059
URL and so if your Chrome browser is

395
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:03,170
up-to-date and suppose

396
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,500
by OSB and you plug in a web USB you

397
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,750
know like compatible device it's going

398
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,070
to immediately pop up this notification

399
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,350
and it's going to say hey like I

400
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,139
detected this machine you should go to X

401
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:19,130
URL in order to connect so out of the

402
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,139
box someone has pulled this piece of

403
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,910
hardware out and they plug it in and

404
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,410
they immediately know where to go you

405
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,240
know to to start interacting with it and

406
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,430
I think that that's one of the single

407
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,690
most powerful features of this and I

408
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,399
love that it's just like a descriptor

409
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,170
that you set on the device but you're

410
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,880
probably thinking you know where

411
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,550
JavaScript developers and every

412
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,620
everything starts looking like a no

413
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,320
without JavaScript um oh and you know

414
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,500
why are we doing this in the browser why

415
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,060
we turn the turn the browser into an

416
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,620
operating system it's something that I

417
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,540
hear a lot so I I just want to talk

418
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,860
about some of the advantages there might

419
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,600
be and why I've being so pushy about

420
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,699
trying to make make this happen over the

421
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:02,779
last few years so in my opinion hardware

422
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:05,389
interfaces so writing software to you

423
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:07,940
know to integrate with your devices it

424
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,890
should be faster make it should be

425
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,660
cross-platform and it should be easy to

426
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,670
make a cross-platform it should look

427
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,070
good and it should be accessible you

428
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,660
know screen readers should be able to

429
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,079
see it this should be like in easy ways

430
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,640
in order to make that accessible in

431
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,320
every single platform without having to

432
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,940
like learn every system for doing that

433
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,380
as well right and browsers are really

434
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,060
commonly installed application on many

435
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,180
computers this doesn't necessarily

436
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,880
require like the person to be online

437
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,449
either you know if you wanted to try and

438
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:42,890
run something on localhost that will

439
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,250
actually work as well and browser-based

440
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,890
interface has just happened to be those

441
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,170
four things that I conveniently put in

442
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,209
the list before you can rapidly

443
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:55,610
prototype web interfaces that you can

444
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,410
hop patch them really easily and deploy

445
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,350
updates CSS is incredibly powerful to

446
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,449
make something look friendly and to help

447
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:04,280
you know organize information and things

448
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,380
like that and you have a consistent

449
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,390
accessibility tree if you make it

450
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,000
accessible you know in general in a

451
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,069
browser by respecting the wicked

452
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,900
guidelines and making sure that you're

453
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,890
making use of Aria features my needed

454
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,880
then it's going to be accessible to like

455
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,680
all of the different browser choices if

456
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,020
we're able to have web usb come to every

457
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,820
browser in the future and I think that's

458
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,640
actually really really powerful and

459
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,150
straight from the web USB spec with this

460
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,760
API hardware manufacturers will have the

461
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,230
ability to build cross-platform

462
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,290
JavaScript SDKs for their devices so you

463
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,510
know who likes the idea of the fact that

464
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,940
if really cool stuff comes out on

465
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,950
Kickstarter or like just you know is

466
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,410
made by big manufacturers wouldn't it be

467
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,180
cool if like we were considered a

468
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,440
first-class citizen and we immediately

469
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,020
got JavaScript SDKs to play with and all

470
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,780
we needed to know what's HTML and how to

471
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,850
do control transfers is that like you

472
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,440
know sending things they could give us

473
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,750
like a development kit that actually has

474
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,370
all of that stuff laid out and all the

475
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,960
for us to start using it I think that's

476
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,330
awesome so how do we use this I can hear

477
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,160
my friend Nathan in the back hi Nathan

478
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,610
he's so cute so you're using Web USB

479
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,630
it's a little bit involved because we

480
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,370
have that sort of user permission model

481
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,450
so I just wanted to step you through

482
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,160
this really quickly before we look at a

483
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,170
little bit of code so you've got your

484
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,570
user you've got your browser and they've

485
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,610
plugged their device into it and you

486
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,170
know the user could be you or it could

487
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,330
be like you know someone who's bought

488
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,340
your product and you want them to start

489
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,960
you know joining the two together you

490
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,160
want them to use their browser to

491
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,800
interact with the device the first thing

492
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,510
we need is a user event so they need to

493
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,740
do something like click or just

494
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,690
something intentional in order to start

495
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,880
the process with pairing to the device

496
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,400
once they've done that the browser will

497
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,320
then look for devices and we can give it

498
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,300
an optional filter such as the product

499
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,980
or the vendor ID so that we can actually

500
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,840
just fish out exactly what they're

501
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,750
looking for to help them out

502
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,510
it then returns any devices that are

503
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,250
plugged in that it finds that matches

504
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,420
those requirements the browser then says

505
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,790
hey I found this device I'm pretty sure

506
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,460
this is what you want do you give

507
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,930
permission for this website to start

508
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,990
interacting with it the user then

509
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,850
confirms the permission or they can deny

510
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,190
it or they can just like not do anything

511
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,070
close the tab which is a sometimes

512
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,530
coming with other permissions

513
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,880
but if they do confirm that permission

514
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,670
then we can immediately start opening

515
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,550
the device connection we can select a

516
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,100
configuration which you'll see in the

517
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,560
code very soon we claim an interface

518
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,300
which again is just like a term that we

519
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,800
use when we're using the web ESB

520
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,870
protocol so we claiming interface in

521
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,700
order to be able to start like using the

522
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,760
endpoints of that interface for your in

523
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,320
and out-out in order to talk to the

524
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,950
device and we finally start the

525
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,090
transference which is really really cool

526
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,070
but you know when you actually see a

527
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,720
demo of this which I'm hoping my demo

528
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,430
works it's a long story

529
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,170
but you'll see like that this actually

530
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,360
looks very fast it's it's more work for

531
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,070
the developer than anything but for the

532
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,850
user it feels pretty seamless so this is

533
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,760
part of the code for for getting started

534
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,020
you have your filters so you can see

535
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,850
here that I have a specific vendor ID

536
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,710
that I want to look for so this vendor

537
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,570
ID might belong to a company such as

538
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,210
Arduino or Adafruit or maybe it's your

539
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,470
own company we then I'm using fancy

540
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,570
async/await and because it's so so I'm

541
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,420
I'm basically just accessing the USB API

542
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,370
from the navigator object like how cool

543
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,290
is that it's directly in the browser and

544
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,030
so I'm requesting the device by passing

545
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,490
in those options it will eventually come

546
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,430
back and if it found you know some

547
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,720
matches then I'm gonna be able to look

548
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,740
at the device product name the

549
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,330
manufacturer name and things like that

550
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,740
so that's pretty cool so some of the

551
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,010
same code is at the top we request the

552
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,490
device we open the device once it is

553
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,830
confirmed to be opened we use our data

554
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,720
sheets for our devices which again is a

555
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,790
really cool thing to learn about to

556
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,680
select the right configuration we want

557
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,200
and to claim the right interface so the

558
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,520
interface is to do with like the

559
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,870
endpoints where we want to communicate

560
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,080
in and out so devices can have several

561
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,330
different interfaces so again you can

562
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,590
check your datasheet to find out which

563
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,600
one you need after that you can just

564
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,630
start sending data so I am doing device

565
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,520
transfer out I'm choosing the first

566
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,150
sorry the second endpoint on my

567
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,470
interface and I'm just sending the byte

568
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,680
like 0 sorry 1 a so I'm just sending

569
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,870
like 1 byte of information and that one

570
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,170
a might be an opcode it might

571
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,820
something like make a noise in my device

572
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,490
you know it could be start uploading

573
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,140
firmware or something like that it's

574
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,210
really up to the device manufacturer so

575
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,680
it's really hard for me to give you

576
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,840
super specific hello world examples

577
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,980
because it really does depend on the

578
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,170
device but then we can wait for a

579
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,970
response which is pretty cool by doing a

580
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,820
transfer in instead of a transfer out we

581
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,920
can supply the endpoint which is the

582
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,800
first argument and we can also ask for

583
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,500
how many bytes we want so I'm asking for

584
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,690
five bytes in this case and then we can

585
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,550
console.log out their response so again

586
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,690
if you're not familiar with the USB

587
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,370
interfaces this might be a bit like I

588
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,560
there's a lot of terminology here that I

589
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,540
don't know about but what I do like is

590
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,520
that it is built on existing standards

591
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,160
so you don't have to wait for people to

592
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,420
start writing blog posts about this

593
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,740
stuff you can go and read up on the

594
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,800
existing USB spec and start using kind

595
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,720
of more native libraries such as Libya

596
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,160
speak if you really wanted to to get

597
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,550
started and again I love data sheets

598
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,260
just want to take a moment to respect

599
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,570
how awesome they are and so they will

600
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,980
give you this information that you're

601
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,510
looking for and often it's in handy

602
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,310
table format so you can see here it's

603
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,140
giving you how many configurations there

604
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,050
are and things like that so if you see

605
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,610
that there's only one configuration then

606
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,890
you can just like pick the zero one

607
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,350
right so it will actually sometimes give

608
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,610
you that information and if you don't

609
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,170
know a lot you can just guess and

610
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:06,550
eventually it will work so yeah so I

611
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,020
didn't do a lot of hardware demos

612
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,940
anymore I tend to talk more on a variety

613
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,430
of topics but I'm sort of known for my

614
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,330
hardware talks so I'm gonna do some

615
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,000
demos uh-huh so we'll see how they go

616
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,470
these are especially fragile demos for a

617
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,300
couple of reasons so my first disclaimer

618
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,670
to you is that Web USB you know it's

619
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,010
changing it's new it's fancy it really

620
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,690
works in Chrome

621
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,640
and everything that I've made is on

622
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,160
weird get branches on my local computer

623
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,430
that I've deployed somewhere and some of

624
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,200
it was written on airplanes so it's not

625
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,920
fantastic the other thing is this is

626
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,110
literally where I was when I got a call

627
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,270
from Deus cough saying someone dropped

628
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,920
out do you want to give a talk

629
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,380
and I was like uh I don't really have

630
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,360
any of my stuff on me like I don't have

631
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,280
any of the stuff that I could you know

632
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,030
show how Web USB works or anything so I

633
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,060
did call in my friend Rick I was like

634
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,650
hey do you have all this stuff you're

635
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,630
coming to jail scones do you have a chip

636
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,490
that you don't care if I brick like and

637
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,280
he was really great so thank you Rick

638
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,230
for saving me today and I just wanted to

639
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:23,750
give him a quick can because thank you

640
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,410
so what I really wanted to do was I

641
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,750
wanted to show you the futures of Web

642
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,850
USB right I want it to be like here's a

643
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,150
chip you know it's a bit micro chip that

644
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,950
you know you can like you flick off an

645
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,110
hour dimino and sup programming and the

646
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,720
little the sort of like long red device

647
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,950
you see at the top is actually a

648
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,840
programmer and that programmer does

649
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,360
speak Web USB so theoretically you know

650
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,680
I was going to show you this thing that

651
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,020
uploads code to the chip and everything

652
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,300
but unfortunately this is all I brought

653
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,790
with me on my vacation and I feel like

654
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,650
that's still a decent amount to bring on

655
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,250
a vacation so I had a lot of stuff

656
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,290
there's been a lot of macgyvering over

657
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,550
the last few days so if you've seen me

658
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,140
intently like putting jump wise

659
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,580
everywhere and tweeting about needing

660
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,770
jumping jump was that was me trying to

661
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,780
get that really cool demo that I just

662
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,460
showed you here to work and I just

663
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,670
couldn't get it going I did half hack an

664
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,100
Arduino to get it to pretend to be this

665
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,300
programmer and I was like really proud

666
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,650
of that but yeah I just didn't quite get

667
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,480
there so I do apologize but I do have a

668
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
video of that demo but I do have a

669
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,860
different demo that you'll probably kind

670
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,300
of resonate with better anyway

671
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,730
so I'm going to show you that um really

672
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,350
quickly and then if we have time I can

673
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,390
show you the other video so you can see

674
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,520
that I have a camera focused on me that

675
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:43,990
is deliberate I don't like so I have

676
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,000
this device here so on the bottom is

677
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,410
like you can think of this as the

678
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,210
Arduino board this one is from Adafruit

679
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,100
it's the feather 32 u 4

680
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,620
it's a fantastic little device and you

681
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,660
can plug all these different sort of

682
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,460
like wings onto it will you just stack

683
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,170
them on top brick walls room was

684
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,940
fantastic and he brought me this triple

685
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,410
ax which just means that I can have them

686
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,240
side by side but they're still connected

687
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,770
to each other like this stacked this is

688
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,320
magical I didn't even know income by the

689
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,940
so this is a little screen here so my

690
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,790
aim is to use the browser to like send

691
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,350
something to the screen and then that's

692
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,510
going to be our happy demo for today so

693
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,500
I just wanted to show you this before

694
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,940
you plug it in and then I'm actually

695
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,170
going to go to my browser because

696
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,400
hopefully you'll see that that

697
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,910
notification comes up I can't find me

698
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,470
there we go alright so I'm gonna plug

699
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,120
this into my computer and then I'll hold

700
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,620
this up later just to see if it actually

701
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:38,559
works let's see oh alright so that's

702
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,630
pretty small don't clap no no no no no

703
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,790
that's not the Corvette but anyway you

704
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,429
see here it says feather 32-year for as

705
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:51,460
i said go to web USB dot fragile doubt

706
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,960
systems which is a domain name and that

707
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,390
I actually own it's meant for my demos

708
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,920
that are really bad like this okay okay

709
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,210
so my friend made this cool thing called

710
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,179
Oh lead Jas designer and then I like

711
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:07,470
fancied it up with a rainbow but I

712
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,690
although it would look like cool but I

713
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,760
also like hacked it to work with web US

714
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,110
base this previously didn't work with

715
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,850
web USB you could just design stuff

716
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,679
download it and then upload it to an

717
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,900
Arduino later so I'm gonna write

718
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,090
something real quick I'm gonna try so

719
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:27,970
hard not to go over time hi Jay yeah

720
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,140
this is really cool you should go play

721
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,370
with this just in general you know it's

722
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,260
like a pit ah'd but it's um for

723
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,830
monochrome screens so hi Jas kampf looks

724
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,059
terrible but I'm Russian

725
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:43,540
alright um so technically that means

726
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,190
that if we click connect

727
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,920
and cross our fingers oh there we go so

728
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,390
we have the LCD to you for right there

729
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,830
we're going to try and connect to it I

730
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,809
don't see what happens oh I saw

731
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,220
something it might actually work

732
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,690
okay so this is really hard to actually

733
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,830
do without kind of like losing the focus

734
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,220
of the the browser so let's see what we

735
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,900
can do huh

736
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,880
I don't have DV running right now I sort

737
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,840
of shot a bunch of stuff beyond alright

738
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,050
so I'm gonna click send image

739
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:25,840
and then that was not what I was

740
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,670
expecting to actually go wrong you know

741
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:32,679
what I mean like okay so I did a weird

742
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:34,120
thing where I go to cable stock I'm just

743
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,679
gonna have to like redo this I'm so

744
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,300
sorry geez just just building the

745
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,740
suspense you're welcome

746
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,480
okay so I have to like re refresh this

747
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,790
so okay so this is where I'm the second

748
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,590
thing doesn't work so normally when you

749
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,030
want to kill Johnny Five this is what

750
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,440
this is using you send just a control C

751
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,030
how do you do that in the browser it's

752
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,540
not it doesn't work at oh I lost my

753
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:08,299
screen I don't any minute now

754
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:11,190
yeah okay

755
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,330
I'm waiting for my confidence monitor

756
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,090
okay all right sorry oh my god I'm gonna

757
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,240
have to draw this again let's just

758
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,559
connect to it first huh

759
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,340
yep looks good to me hi this is gonna be

760
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,900
worse

761
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,920
crap I'm running out of time I'm so glad

762
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,500
I didn't bring the other damn right now

763
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,280
Jay s clump it's fine

764
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,400
okay so we're gonna hold this up and

765
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,470
then not screw up the AV the same Oh

766
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:59,669
I've tangled it again okay we ready

767
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,179
that works surprisingly well and I feel

768
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:03,890
like you clap louder than them so that

769
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:08,510
that's good okay all right cool

770
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,419
all right so that worked so that was

771
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:13,220
literally seamless because there was

772
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,169
just none of this fancy stuff like

773
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:17,120
gluing it all together it was just like

774
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,250
look there was this impacts and I want

775
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,510
to thank Louis for that because he wrote

776
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,070
the kind of hack that got Johnny Five

777
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,270
working with you web us because that's

778
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,620
actually not even supposed to be a thing

779
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,360
but he did really good at that so Thank

780
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,730
You Louis this is my other demo which

781
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,840
was oh yes like you Louis yes

782
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,200
cos he's here today and he was doing the

783
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,480
note copters yesterday who's awesome so

784
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,890
this is actually like what happens when

785
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,450
you try and program that bad chip so

786
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,130
this was the demo that actually worked

787
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,750
that I shot in my hotel room so you can

788
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,210
see there it read the program it got the

789
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,370
chip signature and each little hash you

790
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,380
see that he's like one page of memory

791
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,090
being written so I was able to even get

792
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,280
like the oh okay I wrote that page I

793
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,660
finished that page I finished this one

794
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,630
so like you can like make an ID natively

795
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,740
in the browser now and you can like

796
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,360
program microchips and stuff like I

797
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,010
mentioned just going to your own going I

798
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,299
don't know how to use this and like

799
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,620
there's like drag drop scratch

800
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,360
interfaces to like program these and

801
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,460
like I just I just wanted to tell you

802
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,090
how excited it was so yeah cool so demo

803
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,760
number one was made with Web USB serial

804
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,710
which was written by Lewis so yeah thank

805
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,820
you so much for that because it's

806
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,960
definitely a really cool hack

807
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,330
johnny-five was what I was using in

808
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,679
order to like write to the screen

809
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,080
I wrote the module to that actually the

810
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,730
kind of like jaws pitches and and can

811
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,290
send texts and stuff to the screen I

812
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,380
also wrote PNG to LCD which allows me to

813
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,210
also like upload bitmaps which I didn't

814
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,500
have time to show you but you could like

815
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,840
upload pictures of cats and stuff and it

816
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,890
will convert it Rachel my friends did

817
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:49,010
oled Jeff's designer which is Blom and I

818
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,809
used to with hack which was the weirdest

819
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,370
thing ever to do for hardware I think I

820
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,960
texted America and I was like I'm using

821
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,640
webpack for hardware I don't like this

822
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,590
world at all

823
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,510
I thought I'd got away with it for a

824
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,490
while demo number two is made with a

825
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,010
viago SDK 500 version 2 which is just

826
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,600
the protocol that the programmer speaks

827
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,360
that's part of my JavaScript hardware

828
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,250
repertoire I'm using a viago

829
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,039
ISP Mach 2 which is the programmer so

830
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,020
those two together and what allows me to

831
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,270
speak it and I'm using webpack and I

832
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,070
wrote that really bad code on a plane to

833
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,200
Australia a few months ago so I'm just

834
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,630
glad that it worked in the demo so

835
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,610
futures before I run out of time current

836
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:33,860
support let's talk about that sad so it

837
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,539
really wants to quit but what's cool is

838
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,840
that it works on Chrome for Android so I

839
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,370
have this really cool device that's too

840
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,500
small to show up here but you can like

841
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,880
if you can get one of those weird like

842
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,309
you know female USB to like male micro

843
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,529
USB you can like plug stuff into your

844
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:50,539
phone and just start controlling lights

845
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:53,059
and stuff so that's actually really cool

846
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:55,070
right so I'm hoping that this is more

847
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,429
green soon I work on myself so I'm

848
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:00,169
working on it I'm like winking at the

849
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:01,940
edge people and I'm giving them all of

850
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,250
these Web USB devices but I'm not sure

851
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,500
how much impact I'm having so please

852
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,240
tell browser vendors that you want this

853
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,890
stuff please help me because I can't do

854
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,190
this so why support this I feel like I

855
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,360
did a pretty good job of kind of showing

856
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,549
that but again just a draw from the web

857
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:18,770
USB spec this will be good for the web

858
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,750
because instead of waiting for a new

859
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,429
kind of device to be popular enough for

860
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:24,350
browsers to provide a specific API which

861
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,020
is kind of what's happening now new and

862
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,669
innovative hardware can be built from

863
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:30,679
the web from day one that's pretty sweet

864
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:32,419
you know you don't have to like wait for

865
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:35,059
these things so like anything can be

866
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,950
interfaced as long as it's just like a

867
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,020
regular USB which is a lot of devices

868
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,990
out there already so if you wanted to

869
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,090
learn more definitely again highly

870
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,100
recommend that you check out the web USB

871
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,020
spec it is hosted at the WCG github

872
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,760
repository and you organization you'll

873
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,059
find that at web USB my Arduino the

874
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:58,789
Arduino example will get you started so

875
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:01,250
I sort of was doing similar things in

876
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,809
that demo but I was using joining five

877
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:04,730
on top of that so please check that out

878
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,340
because it has step-by-step instructions

879
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,869
on sort of how to implement your very

880
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:11,690
first cool thing including like a web

881
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,099
page where you can just immediately run

882
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:14,450
it and as long as you've uploaded the

883
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,270
code to your Arduino it's good and my

884
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,849
demo is at that address there but again

885
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,889
it's like super shady code but yeah but

886
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:24,320
hopefully you'll enjoy reading it so

887
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,340
thank you
