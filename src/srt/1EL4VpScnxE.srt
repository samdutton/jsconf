1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,880

so yeah both of I can't walk nice little

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,849
animation well really this talk could

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,369
have might as well been a title let's

4
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:20,169
learn everything we know or we can about

5
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:25,210
font face so as Jen said I'm Zach

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,949
Leatherman I live in omaha nebraska

7
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:31,119
anybody from Nebraska hey one guy I know

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,320
him but I work for filmer group and our

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,059
tagline kind of is we want to make the

10
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,940
web work for everybody and so we kind of

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,620
took this brooch when we're thinking

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,219
about how to implement fine icons but

13
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,469
Carl Sagan once said if you wish to make

14
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:50,140
a phone icon from scratch you have to

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,480
first invent the universe for any cosmos

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,730
fans out there so this is kind of the

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,719
agenda that we're going to go through

18
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,489
today we're going to do a little bit

19
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:58,960
about font face I'm going to go over

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,010
unicode how fonts look when they load

21
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,810
one weird trick that we can use to fix

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,090
all our phone icon problems and then

23
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,050
i'll go through a little bit of my

24
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,290
magazine subscription preferences Sarah

25
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,370
wasn't a cat person but I am so you guys

26
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,400
get a suffer through that all right so

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,440
font face was first introduced in the

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,270
super modern year of 1997 it was in

29
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,570
netscape for you can believe that which

30
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,540
was only two years after the font tag

31
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,200
was introduced in HTML 3.2 you if you

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,460
guys don't remember the font tag that's

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,120
okay because pepperidge farm remembers

34
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,330
how about back to font face was first

35
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,880
introduced in CSS two and then removed

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,890
in CSS 2.1 a lot of people don't know

37
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,180
that and then re-added and css3 just to

38
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,370
go over the syntax really quickly you

39
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,770
have a font family at the top you don't

40
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,180
need quotes in there a lot of people say

41
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,620
you need quotes but if you just have

42
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,210
white space in between your font family

43
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,340
name you don't need quotes then a list

44
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,920
of URLs pointing to your font formats so

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,149
the most common the most simplified

46
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:12,190
version just has two different formats

47
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,900
there's a lot of them formats you can

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,920
choose from

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,330
and if you ever feel like you're

50
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,760
drowning in the sea of different font

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,319
format so you can just ask our good

52
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,140
friend David Hasselhoff he'll tell you

53
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,680
what format to use so this is the can i

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,860
use layout for browser support for the

55
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,020
wha format really good modern browsers

56
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,660
have work but if we used woof and only

57
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,340
the wha format would be committing the

58
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,750
most common mistake in computer science

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,500
which is the waffle in error it's going

60
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,800
to get better I tell ya all right so

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,900
we're adding truetype support would be

62
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,959
our next our next type that gives us a

63
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,980
little bit better android android

64
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,370
support there and if we need i ate this

65
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,860
actually works for i 6 plus but we have

66
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,660
film a group we cut the mustard for IE 8

67
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,819
plus so this presentation is sort of

68
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,830
tailored for that we want to add the

69
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,360
embedded open type format and when

70
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,819
you're adding the opening embedded open

71
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,700
type format excuse me you want to use

72
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,549
this there's a URL parsing problem in

73
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,079
Internet Explorer so you want to include

74
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,049
this ? pound I you fixed to make it

75
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:33,730
parse the URL correctly so when you add

76
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,739
embedded opentype you get ie8 nice but

77
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,840
if you want chrome on windows you want

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,410
to add SVG now chrome on windows already

79
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,560
supports the wall format obviously but

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,739
it uses a an older text rendering engine

81
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,170
called GDI and they're currently in the

82
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,609
process of upgrading their text

83
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,950
rendering engine to direct right and

84
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,100
that upgrade is available in chrome 35

85
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,690
behind a flag so when you look at your

86
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,630
phone icons in windows all the way from

87
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,970
XP to Windows 8.1 it's not just an older

88
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,819
Windows problem the fonts will not look

89
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,530
as crisp as maybe you want them to look

90
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,079
and the way to get around that is to add

91
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:24,650
SVG and SVG font to our font stack oops

92
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,820
right and when you do that it also buys

93
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,400
us old iOS Safari which is basically not

94
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,150
used anymore and our lovely blackberry 6

95
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,680
if anybody tests on that a show of hands

96
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,320
who tests on black right 6 yeah that's

97
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,790
right that but okay so I've tested this

98
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,850
on blackberry 6 cool you don't have to

99
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,160
and you might think that you just plop

100
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,820
it at the end of your your source URL

101
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,290
list here but that would be a mistake

102
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,150
because chrome on windows obviously

103
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,620
support some of those other fonts and it

104
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,890
when it encounters a font format that it

105
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,990
knows it uses the first one that

106
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,150
understands so we get into some pretty

107
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,730
gnarly code we actually include a

108
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,380
completely separate font face block

109
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,390
inside of a media query that's WebKit

110
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,880
only which is not the nicest thing but

111
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,220
it solves our problem and if you

112
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,920
remember a little bit about blackberry 6

113
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,690
so we added this font face block to our

114
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,860
page and we bring it up in our

115
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,180
blackberry 6 browser this is what it

116
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,000
looks like not great right so blackberry

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,650
6 does support SVG fonts but not really

118
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,500
because if the text looks all jumbled up

119
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,390
so we can actually use another qualifier

120
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,940
on our media query block to sort of

121
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,610
qualified it that additionally so this

122
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,270
is the min resolution a little flowchart

123
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,770
for us and some learning to tile for the

124
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,720
flowchart up there so inner explorer and

125
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,730
firefox ivs don't sportman device pixel

126
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,570
ratio min resolution buys us only chrome

127
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,860
and opera and Safari Mobile Safari

128
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,790
android and blackberry don't support

129
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,130
that so that font face block has only

130
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,419
served at chrome and opera so we lose

131
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,030
old Iowa safarian and Blackberry there

132
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,919
but it solves the real problem that

133
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,960
we're trying to fix which was chrome and

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,190
what does all right so everybody take a

135
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,979
breath I was a lot we're going to go

136
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:38,550
over just

137
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,370
super quick review the top block is our

138
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,870
normal font face blog the bottom block

139
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,380
is the problem to fix chrome GDI on

140
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,480
Windows and we can remove that after a

141
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,460
chrome direct right goes to stable which

142
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,760
should be pretty soon that's in the next

143
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,850
couple versions probably all right so

144
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,910
yeah that was a lot I know so let's go

145
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,070
to our happy place luckily we're in

146
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,240
Florida right here so what happens when

147
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,830
I put this font face block on our web

148
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,330
page we look at in the devtools there's

149
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,030
no request captured if you just put a

150
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,430
font face block on your web page without

151
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,770
actually using it inside the page no

152
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,870
font will download so I tested this in a

153
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,130
bunch of different browsers again so you

154
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,310
guys don't have to this actually worked

155
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,530
in android 2.3 which was I was kind of

156
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,110
surprised but not a 98 so I able to

157
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,690
download everything but if you want your

158
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,790
font to download you use it on family

159
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,650
right or if you want to do it

160
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,690
dynamically later on you can just assign

161
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:48,270
a font family with JavaScript all right

162
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,120
we've made it through the first rock

163
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,200
let's go over a little bit bout Unicode

164
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,330
so basic Latin Unicode here's the

165
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,240
different you know fonts are kind of

166
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,280
made up of code points kind of like the

167
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,040
DNA of fonts so for example code point

168
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,150
hex 41 maps to uppercase a in basic

169
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,520
Latin and that's how we can kind of use

170
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,100
different fonts for its and content

171
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,990
right the content is assigned code

172
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,760
points when just substitute fonts tell

173
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,620
where we want and then the higher

174
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,510
Unicode ranges we get into more

175
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,030
interesting symbols like 2261 is the

176
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,790
triple bar mathematical symbol and we

177
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,260
also come lease it for hamburger menus

178
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,370
how many people have a hamburger menu on

179
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,370
their site all right cool but these

180
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,770
every single code point kind of has a

181
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,860
semantic meaning right so triple bar is

182
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,660
kind of expected to be triple bar no

183
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,600
matter what font you font family you use

184
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,740
then you get even into higher ranges you

185
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,660
get into something called emoji so moche

186
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,990
is kind of this it was first introduced

187
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,709
on on Japanese phones I think but it

188
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:01,829
gives you these bitmap characters that

189
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:03,209
are assigned to these higher Unicode

190
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,990
ranges but moji isn't necessarily

191
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,149
installed on cross browser either it's

192
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,980
not just an operating system level thing

193
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,990
you have to your browser has to support

194
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,170
it so for instance in Safari you might

195
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,410
see a pizza icon for that code point but

196
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,970
when you bring it up in chrome it

197
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,040
doesn't show anything this is kind of

198
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,870
what Jennifer Lawrence I think commented

199
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,610
on when she was interviewed a while back

200
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:34,440
and she said where's the pizza I told

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,010
you get better all right so like

202
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,300
Jennifer Lawrence we might start to

203
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,490
wonder how consistent are these glyphs

204
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,339
cross-platform cross browser luckily

205
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,500
friend of the internet john holt ripley

206
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,200
created this tool called unify and he's

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,610
gone through and tested each of these

208
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,959
unicode characters individually for us

209
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,430
so if you check out his site he has this

210
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,459
huge matrix and he puts the glyphs on

211
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,350
the left and then he tests them in a

212
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,390
bunch of different browsers and this

213
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,890
thing goes on probably I don't know

214
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,899
forever he tested a bunch of different

215
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,810
devices and browsers so if you if you're

216
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,160
going to use unicode on your site

217
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,720
definitely check out these glyphs to

218
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,959
make sure that they're cross-platform

219
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,959
cross-browser supported and just from an

220
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,899
accessibility perspective the Unicode

221
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,779
glyphs are maybe not read out loud like

222
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,089
you might want them to be so r instance

223
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:29,550
the triple bar the hamburger menu if you

224
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,490
go into a screen reader and encounters

225
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,110
that character will read it aloud as

226
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,290
identical to which probably is not what

227
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,820
you want when you're using it as a menu

228
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,279
icon but luckily unify is also tested in

229
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,230
screen readers as well so inside of

230
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,790
general ripley's tool he has all these

231
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,110
test results here that you can check out

232
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,770
and he tests in chromevox jaws NVDA and

233
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,990
voiceover so you don't have to test him

234
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,790
that easier either it's making super

235
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,130
easy for you guys

236
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,270
and I kind of mentioned that Unicode has

237
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,890
each one of those code points kind of

238
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,050
has its semantic meaning so there's a

239
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,910
section of Unicode called the private

240
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,950
use area and inside the private use area

241
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,870
there is it's kind of a free-for-all

242
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,990
there is there's no semantic the code

243
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,580
points inside of the private use area

244
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,620
and this is to avoid collision with

245
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,209
other defined character and because of

246
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:31,860
the kind of free-for-all nature of the

247
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,260
private use area you can get kind of

248
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,089
unpredictable results even with the same

249
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,950
browser on different platforms so for

250
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,490
example if I bring up the private use

251
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,790
area Unicode in Safari it shows these

252
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,860
black boxes for those code points but in

253
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,779
mobile safari it will show these weird

254
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,930
guess who character looking things but

255
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,930
typically fight on icon font authors

256
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,459
will use these to avoid overloading an

257
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:04,649
existing code point all right we went

258
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:05,850
over unicode now we're going to go over

259
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,209
a little bit about how fonts load so our

260
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:11,820
font face request goes out into the

261
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,860
world as to how does it look when it's

262
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,500
in flight so this is kind of the

263
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,650
quintessential font face problem right

264
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,089
when our font face is loading the font

265
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,730
is invisible it doesn't show fallback

266
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,160
text so that the top is there the top

267
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,750
section is using a local font the bottom

268
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,709
section is using a font face and while

269
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,680
the request is is is in progress nothing

270
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:46,100
is shown to the user

271
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,390
and much in the same way we might this

272
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,970
character from duck taxi would be the

273
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,480
text is invisible so this is the flasher

274
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,959
invisible text or the point I'm not

275
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,100
exactly sure how to pronounce that but

276
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,959
that's actually good for icon fonts

277
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,790
right because no fallback characters are

278
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,040
shown while the font face is being

279
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,510
requested while it's being loaded and

280
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,970
then once the font face successfully

281
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,060
completes our primary font family is

282
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,320
shown which reveals our icon but it's

283
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,260
bad for content fonts right because the

284
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,649
text might load after your images do so

285
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:29,279
it's not good for users if the user

286
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,600
wants to read your content as soon as

287
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,470
possible so what some browsers have

288
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,180
started to do and this is in Chrome

289
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,730
Canary currently in Firefox as they add

290
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,500
a timeout so after three seconds and it

291
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,600
will rear-ender the text using a

292
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,720
fallback font and then once the font

293
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
face completes successfully it will

294
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,220
we're under the text using the primary

295
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,829
font face so that's the that's the

296
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:02,579
primary one this is the flash of

297
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:08,550
unstyled text or fout great names for

298
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,990
these things but it's so a timeout is

299
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,579
really good for content fonts right

300
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,649
because we want huge paragraphs of text

301
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:17,010
to be usable to the user as soon as

302
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,579
possible but it's bad for icon fonts

303
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,089
because when the three seconds the 33

304
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,949
second timeout has been reached will

305
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,959
often show this fall back character

306
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,820
which is completely unintelligible to

307
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,230
the user right they have no idea what

308
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,040
that is and then once our font load

309
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,870
successfully that's when our icon then

310
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,089
switches from that fall back glyph to

311
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:41,640
the primary icon this is a real problem

312
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,589
right because i took the screenshots i'm

313
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:45,149
going to post a screenshot on twitter

314
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,060
and i took the i took that image that

315
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,120
they had shared and so get abuses icon

316
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
fonts currently and so someone i'm

317
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,630
pretty sure this was probably taken in

318
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,339
firefox because far i think this is the

319
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,529
default glyph that shows on firefox when

320
00:14:58,529 --> 00:14:59,150
the

321
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,940
and those higher Unicode ranges so

322
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,260
someone took this after the timeout

323
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,330
after the three second timeout had had

324
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,420
passed they took their screen shot

325
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,910
before the font had successfully loaded

326
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,450
so if you can believe it I kind of agree

327
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,850
with how internet explorer does it right

328
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,680
because they show they don't show

329
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,900
invisible text at all they show the

330
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,340
fallback right from the beginning so the

331
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,630
content is immediately usable

332
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,320
immediately readable so plus 12 internet

333
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,810
explorer for that and this is this is

334
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,310
how it should be for content fronts

335
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,780
right we want our content to be as

336
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,750
quickly accessible to the user as

337
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,500
possible especially if they're on a

338
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,420
really slow connection or conference

339
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:44,930
Wi-Fi so i did some testing for cross

340
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,300
browser timeouts as well so I kind of

341
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,220
mentioned that chrome and Chrome Canary

342
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,410
and soup and firefox have a 30-second

343
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,180
timeout and explore doesn't matter

344
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,130
because they show fall back right in the

345
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,640
beginning and then all of these there

346
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,080
might be you see a unifying

347
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,790
characteristic of the browsers that are

348
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,700
on the right side they're all WebKit so

349
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,170
an interesting thing that I ran into was

350
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,650
that in Safari a mobile safari if the

351
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,930
font loads after 60 seconds it just

352
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,810
throws it away so you have this this

353
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,700
hidden text on your page the user can

354
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,030
interact with it they can't see anything

355
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,130
if your font successfully loads after 60

356
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,380
seconds it does nothing with it doesn't

357
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,030
show a fallback font it doesn't do

358
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,410
anything it's just white screen forever

359
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:35,510
so not the most user friendly thing and

360
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,610
also another consideration what happens

361
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,020
when these are hits the stop button so

362
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,920
the font faces in flight the font the

363
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,780
text is invisible the user might hit the

364
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,850
stop button I think maybe I want to read

365
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,230
the text maybe the text will show up

366
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,630
when i hit the step one but in all the

367
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,790
browsers i tested if the font or if the

368
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,920
text was invisible hitting the stop

369
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,680
button does nothing it doesn't show a

370
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,230
fallback fondant it does nothing if you

371
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,210
hit the stop button in chrome canary

372
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,220
after the three second time I has passed

373
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,750
and it's already showing the fallback

374
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,290
font then obviously the text will stay

375
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,350
visible on the screen but in most of the

376
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,130
other browsers

377
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,780
stop button basically doesn't it does

378
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,959
nothing to font face and whether or not

379
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,150
this is intentional this behavior is bad

380
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,250
for content fonts but it's good for icon

381
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,170
fonts right because we don't want the

382
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,819
fall backs to be showing all the time I

383
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,250
don't think that blingo really intended

384
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,770
this the baseball icon to be showing

385
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,600
right next to their login button or

386
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,180
maybe the lipstick at the bottom with

387
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,250
their flight finder I don't think that

388
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,820
was necessarily intentional all right so

389
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,590
how do we solve these problems so first

390
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,040
just a use case so I'm just going to

391
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,990
describe the simplest use case is a

392
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,230
decorative icon it's basically just a

393
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,500
span sitting next to some text that

394
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,510
describes what the icon actually does

395
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,000
and we use a separate element for our

396
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,340
icons because that's the best way to

397
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,380
hide them from screen readers right so

398
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,140
because we pair with descriptive text we

399
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,660
can hide the visual icon from screen

400
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,580
readers all together so they don't they

401
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,000
don't read that triple bar or identical

402
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,160
to that I mentioned earlier and so I

403
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,870
created this little library called off

404
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,920
font guard it's in the filament group

405
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,470
you love that okay yeah it's in the film

406
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,680
a group of repository on github you can

407
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,110
check that out and there's a little test

408
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,760
a little utility inside of that code for

409
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,650
fees on load and the only thing

410
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,150
phosphates on load does it gives you a

411
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,650
call back when your font face has

412
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,420
successfully completed so this is not

413
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,630
the same as like a moderniser feature

414
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,150
test because it will actually measure

415
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,100
the dimensions of the font changing and

416
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,870
it knows that the font has successfully

417
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,440
loaded actual font content and it will

418
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,760
give you a call back that you can

419
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,880
execute when your font faces loaded so

420
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,710
in this case I'm passing it up my icon

421
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,020
font font family I pass it a couple

422
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,420
glyphs that I know it can use to measure

423
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,820
the dimensions of it then a casa de

424
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,850
success callback and then inside that

425
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,930
success callback I add a CSS class to

426
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,390
the top level to the document so at that

427
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,510
point when my icon font exists then I

428
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,610
know that my font has loaded

429
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,840
successfully

430
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,820
and so this is the CSS we used to

431
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,040
implement this decorative icon we use

432
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,030
kind of that same like CSS class guard

433
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,720
like approach where we assign a class to

434
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,490
the top of the document so we know at

435
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,770
this point when this CSS is applied to

436
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,060
the page we know our font had

437
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,400
successfully loaded and we don't worry

438
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,210
about fallback fun so we assign our new

439
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,280
font family and we use CSS content to

440
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,670
show the glyph if you are using type

441
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,290
kits web font loader it will basically

442
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,600
do the same thing it's just a little bit

443
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,670
bigger so if you already have that on

444
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,230
your page and you're using it to load

445
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,350
your content fonts today you can use

446
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,000
this library to add the CSS garden class

447
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,240
to your document element as well another

448
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,460
promising native solution is the CSS

449
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,520
font loading module level 3 it's

450
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,010
currently going through the w3c and this

451
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,670
is the syntax for that uses the nice

452
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,890
promises spec it's basically the same

453
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,250
thing but it's it doesn't you it's

454
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,080
hooked into the actual font paste

455
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,910
requests going behind the scenes and we

456
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,970
don't do magic on JavaScript to

457
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,950
determine second hand when the phone is

458
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,500
loaded so we just pass it a size and a

459
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,360
font family and then we get we passed a

460
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,860
call back to the den function as

461
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,790
promises do and if you want more

462
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,920
information on that Bram Stein is has

463
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,360
cradle polyfill he's working on a

464
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,730
polyfill the spec changed and so he has

465
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,680
to completely I mean you had a working

466
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,120
solution but the spec chain so he has to

467
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,210
go back and change it so yeah if you

468
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,230
want more information on the native

469
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,730
solution definitely follow that follow

470
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,450
along with that but this my icon font

471
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,070
class that we add to our documental it

472
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,960
kind of solves all our problems right we

473
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,420
now control the floyd and the fout and

474
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,700
we don't have any more Unicode surprises

475
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,280
right we control all the fall backs we

476
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,220
don't have any more time out surprises

477
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,460
because we control if the font is loaded

478
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,890
successfully or not and there's no more

479
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,400
stop button surprises right

480
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,600
so on our decorative icon this is what

481
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,680
it looks like while it's loading it

482
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,330
doesn't take up any real estate on the

483
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,050
page that's where the fight would

484
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,580
normally take place and after three

485
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,960
seconds if the browser does have a

486
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,480
timeout nothing happens because we test

487
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,560
to make sure that the phone is lit

488
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,890
successfully and this is when the fout

489
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,330
was normally would normally take place

490
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,950
and then when font-face load comes back

491
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,480
that's when we assign our document class

492
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,840
and our CSS is applied so we don't show

493
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,980
there any fallback glyphs all right so

494
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,160
that was the one weird trick and so next

495
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,700
we're going to take a little bit fancier

496
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,490
magazines all right so here's another

497
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,090
use case right we want to transform

498
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:25,770
content or text into an icon while it's

499
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,390
loading we shall fall back text or a

500
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,130
fullback sentence and then after it

501
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,660
loads we replace that with the with an

502
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,030
icon not the most real estate friendly

503
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,390
solution but I'll go over some more

504
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,210
later for that so here's the giant block

505
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,060
of code for that I've actually divided

506
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,250
into the red is the red applies before

507
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,990
this font is loaded and the green

508
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,390
applies after the phone is loaded so it

509
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,310
makes a little bit easier we just hide

510
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,350
the icon before the font is loaded

511
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,660
successfully switch it to its William

512
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,740
line block and then we use an

513
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,380
accessibility hide feature that I think

514
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,910
probably everyone already knows about

515
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,610
it's built into html5 boilerplate I just

516
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,560
stole this one right now out of html5

517
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,930
boilerplate yeah so that our folic text

518
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,450
is still accessible to screen readers so

519
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,920
it will still be able to read that

520
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,540
facebook fallback text even though it's

521
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:20,610
not visible yeah so it's still screen

522
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,760
reader friendly so in other use cases

523
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,140
transforming a unicode lift to an icon

524
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,140
so the triple triple bar unicode 2261

525
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,630
hamburger menu icon not the most

526
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,280
intuitive thing a lot of people are

527
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,170
using it if you agree with the super

528
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,430
TechCrunch article that came out earlier

529
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,590
this week they kind of wanted to kill

530
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,630
the hamburger menu so I'm here to offer

531
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,170
you a few alternatives brought jank ferd

532
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,150
said that we should start adding text to

533
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,020
the bottom of our hamburger

534
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,780
calling it the hamburger helper you

535
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,350
could also use a hamburger emoji or a

536
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:04,330
veggie burger or a gluten-free hamburger

537
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,810
or Jed Smith schmitz man burger from

538
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:13,600
facebook or scott gels hungry man burger

539
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,370
meal just put the whole image on their

540
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:22,670
peers but so this is kind of the most

541
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,620
real estate friendly approach right so

542
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,900
while Devon is loading we show our

543
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,410
fallback font or a fallback glyph and

544
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,300
after the the fonts successfully

545
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,950
completes that's when we show our fancy

546
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,470
font face icon which is has the nice so

547
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,470
much better has the nice little rounded

548
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:44,720
yeah so here's the code to do that it's

549
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,540
a little bit not later than our last

550
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,970
approach but again I've divided it into

551
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,200
two different sections so we show our

552
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,720
icon or our default Unicode live right

553
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,770
up front to 261 hamburger menu we show

554
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,610
our default fallback text which I think

555
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,390
in this case was the Facebook text using

556
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,800
that same accessibility hiding feature

557
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,720
that I described it the last use case

558
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,340
and then when the font successfully

559
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,170
loads we switch the glyph we can use

560
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,370
whatever we want because we're switching

561
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,370
it in CSS content we use the new font

562
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,380
family and then we adjust our font size

563
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,380
and line height to size the icon as we

564
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:30,200
might want want it to be alright so the

565
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,400
thing I really want to communicate with

566
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,990
this presentation is that we kind of

567
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,790
different goals for icon fonts and

568
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,220
content fonts right since kind of tagged

569
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,010
icon fonts onto an existing mechanism

570
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,030
that we already used for content fonts

571
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,380
we need additional tools to handle them

572
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,040
separately and for right now that means

573
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,720
we have to use JavaScript someday we may

574
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,090
get at CSS only solution and I don't

575
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,410
think there is anything currently going

576
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,540
through the specs for that right now so

577
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,490
if you're interested can form a

578
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,510
