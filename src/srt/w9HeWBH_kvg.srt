00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,750

all right so on that's the title of my

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,359
talk which I completely hate now and I

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,100
thought it was awesome when I picked it

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,740
but then I grew to hate it so let's get

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,460
into it so I'll start with the short to

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,719
recap of 2d geometry and first of all

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,680
let's see what a polygon is and just the

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,250
crud still broken line in a plane in a

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,200
plane there's a word missing there I

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,980
can't believe I missed us the number of

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,980
vertices equals the number of sides

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,690
they're only straight lines besides

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,590
there are no arcs and there are no three

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,120
successive points on the same line

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,039
because you have three successive points

16
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,050
on the same line one connected to two

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,090
two connected to three three connected

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,159
to one that's not a polygon

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,970
that's a downline so these are a few

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,909
examples convex concave convex convex

21
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,430
and regular and then a circle obviously

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,040
not a polygon and not online obviously

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,939
not a polygon a few more examples and

24
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:32,210
three sides four sides five six and it's

25
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,670
going on columns from the first back on

26
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,799
to the last first row regular second row

27
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,560
be a regular third row regular fourth

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,170
row irregular again and this is where

29
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,040
you see such shapes like here you have

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,320
Pentagon's and hexagons and there are 12

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,960
Pentagon's and 20 hexagons and this

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,210
shape is exactly the shape of this does

33
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,849
anybody here have a background in

34
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,459
electronics knowing that what that might

35
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,770
be

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,800
No all right

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,640
so that's a carbon molecule there are 16

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,790
atoms of carbon and the shape is exactly

39
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,489
the same as the one of the ball no not

40
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:27,470
exactly the same because the ball is

41
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,510
obviously round because of the pressure

42
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:38,800
inside but um oops there are also 12

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,709
Pentagon's and 20 hexagons and these are

44
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:49,100
also polygons and these are star

45
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,900
polygons and there are regular polygons

46
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,440
and only the points in red only those

47
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,480
are the vertices and all the sides are

48
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,430
equal and the points where they

49
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,660
intersect those are not vertices and

50
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,310
these are star shaped polygons which are

51
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,810
different from star polygons and let's

52
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,989
move on let's see it and this is

53
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,600
actually the last fly that I act I added

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,950
to the presentation because I thought I

55
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,260
was going to talk about this a lot and I

56
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,140
didn't actually explain it anywhere well

57
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,910
I did explain it in an article that I

58
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,989
wrote a while ago but she put a slide on

59
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,180
it so on the circum circle is the circle

60
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,500
on which all the vertices of a polygon

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,190
are situated of course not all polygons

62
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,310
can have all vertices on a circle but

63
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,859
we're gonna talk only about those that

64
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,160
do and the central angle corresponding

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,019
to one side for example corresponding to

66
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,260
side a beam is going to be this angle a

67
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,700
OB this is the central angle

68
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,150
corresponding to this side so I hope

69
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,819
that clears what the central angle is so

70
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,350
start from the simplest one a rectangle

71
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,500
nothing exciting there with height and

72
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,329
you can make it square if you give it

73
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,850
same width and height you can make it a

74
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,659
parallelogram

75
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:24,770
if you skew it and let's try I'm

76
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,740
particular kind of problem

77
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,180
a rhombus around was some and you can

78
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,400
see this one has different width and

79
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,880
different height and you can see the

80
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,490
angles in it

81
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,880
okay so the rhombus has all four sides

82
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,130
equal so you think that you get a

83
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,120
rhombus by skewing a square let's see

84
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,580
that this is the square so let's see

85
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,720
what happens if we skew it well it's not

86
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,620
rhombus and you can see it better if I

87
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,419
increase the angle it's not so why isn't

88
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:11,190
it what's happening here

89
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,060
well let's see first how the skew

90
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,470
transform works so we have one we start

91
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,620
with a square and we apply a skew

92
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,250
transform on it so you can see that the

93
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,740
skew transform as any other transform

94
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,650
also transforms some the system of

95
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,820
coordinates of the element it's not the

96
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,300
same as it was before and all for every

97
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,030
point of the initial square applying the

98
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,310
skew X preserves the y coordinate and

99
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,050
changes the x coordinate just the x

100
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,250
coordinate and you can see from for

101
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,060
every point XY the new coordinate after

102
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,340
skew is going to be X plus a and Y and

103
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,660
frisky Y is going to be x and y plus a

104
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:15,830
all right but what is a well to

105
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,380
understand that we need to go a bit into

106
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,940
trigonometry so does anybody remember

107
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,440
the stuff well what a sine and a cosine

108
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,370
and tangent are so the sine is the ratio

109
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,000
between the side opposing the angle and

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,980
the hypotenuse the biggest side the one

111
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,640
opposing the 90-degree angle and the

112
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,940
cosine is the ratio between the adjacent

113
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,390
side

114
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,220
the one near it and the hypotenuse and

115
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,290
tangent is the ratio between the

116
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,530
opposite side and the adjacent side and

117
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:05,600
now let's go back to this one so in this

118
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,010
case we consider this triangle and this

119
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:16,190
point has coordinates initially let's go

120
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,980
back this point it has initially

121
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,270
coordinates 0 and Y and after we skew it

122
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,810
it gets here and it has coordinates a

123
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,300
and Y so this piece here is a the

124
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,670
distance from this point to this point

125
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:45,110
this is a but this is half the initial

126
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:55,400
length of the side and this is the skew

127
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,890
angle which is 30 degrees in our case

128
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,310
and this the length of this is y so the

129
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,980
tangent for this angle is going to be a

130
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,620
over Y so we can get a as being Y times

131
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:20,600
the tangent of the skew angle so since

132
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,270
the side of the initial rectangle was to

133
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:33,570
2y and the cosine of this angle

134
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:40,270
is why over the hypotenuse which is just

135
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:47,600
half of the initial side which means

136
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,720
that applying the skew X gives us the

137
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,710
lateral side of two times y over cosine

138
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,620
of 30 degrees in our case skew angle in

139
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:07,630
general so we need to scale down along

140
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,300
the y axis and we need to scale down by

141
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,560
the cosine this is the factor and I

142
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,420
usually don't compute this kind of stuff

143
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,780
I usually use us but I just wrote it

144
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,550
like this this time and you can do more

145
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,720
polygons with CSS and you can get a

146
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,220
hexagon by you're rotating by skewing

147
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:46,860
down you can see it better if I do this

148
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,470
and this is the original element and I

149
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,930
skewed by 30 degrees and then I scale it

150
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:59,320
to make it a rhombus and you can see

151
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,870
that I undo the transforms on the child

152
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,630
element I under the scale and undoing

153
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,570
the scale means scaling by 1 over the

154
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,570
initial scale factor so this is 1 over

155
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:21,370
866 and rotate and skew it by the

156
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,250
opposite angle minus 13 because 2 is 30

157
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,270
and then rotate it to get it right into

158
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,170
position and then scaling and get back

159
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:37,030
because it's height would be still don't

160
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:44,470
comment code like this you can also get

161
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,900
a triangle if you just shift the whole

162
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,560
thing and that's a translate by Yan 50%

163
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,910
and you can move the triangle so that

164
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,840
it's centered it's in the center of the

165
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,530
original system of coordinates and it

166
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,250
goes like this

167
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:16,000
and this Sun translate it's applied this

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,310
one here it's applied on the original

169
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,650
element from the parent element not on

170
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,700
the pseudo element and this value is

171
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,380
actually the inner radius and it's the

172
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,820
inner radius from this kind of triangle

173
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,410
and of course your sassed computed and

174
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,090
we can do more shapes like a pentagon

175
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,180
and how would we do a pentagon I first

176
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,190
had this idea about a year and something

177
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,690
ago and I thought well first use the

178
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,860
rhombus and then inside of it

179
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,040
use another rhombus and then inside that

180
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,450
rhombus is a square

181
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,840
and cut off all the outer elements and

182
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,660
we're left with this this is the

183
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,840
Pentagon and it's actually a regular

184
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,490
pentagon and let's break it into pieces

185
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,980
we can break the Pentagon's into three

186
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,190
pieces three triangles and the sum of

187
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,910
the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees

188
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,370
so we have three triangles so the sum of

189
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,930
the angles of the Pentagon is going to

190
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,210
be sum of the angles for all three

191
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,220
triangles that's gonna be three times

192
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:41,960
180 that's 540 and that means that we

193
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,440
have to divide that 540 to 5 because the

194
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,620
Pentagon has five vertices and one angle

195
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,720
results in 108 so this is going to give

196
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,490
us the skew angle for the first rhombus

197
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,140
and we get the skew angle for the first

198
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,240
rhombus by subtracting 90 degrees from

199
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,700
the value of the angle the angle for the

200
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,850
Pentagon and these are the general

201
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,590
formulas and you can find them on the

202
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,600
internet you don't need to remember them

203
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,550
and so we first get the first rhombus

204
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,840
rotate it and we rotate it by half the

205
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,080
acute angle and this is the acute angle

206
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,330
which is 90 minus the skew angle and the

207
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,590
rotate angle is this over tuned and we

208
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,820
skew it by 18 degrees which was a skew

209
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,550
angle computed previously and we scale

210
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:52,850
it down by cosine of 18 degrees and now

211
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,500
we need to know to get the next formas

212
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,540
we start with the square and actually if

213
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:13,540
we don't apply any transforms on it

214
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,120
it's going to be the same shape as the

215
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,950
parent don't comment CSS like that and

216
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,360
undoing the transforms from the parent

217
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,990
results in a square and now we we make

218
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,530
it a rhombus but it doesn't really look

219
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,750
like before it has the same Center as

220
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:45,890
the first rhombus and oops I think I

221
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,420
blew that well it this thing should

222
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,990
actually have this corner it should have

223
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,180
it up here intersecting this side

224
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,500
somewhere up here so how do we bring it

225
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,710
up and by what distance do we need to

226
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,800
bring it up well we're gonna need a

227
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,700
pentagram for that not this one this one

228
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,740
looks artistic but it's kind of hard to

229
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,240
see angles and stuff so on but this is

230
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,070
actually the first thing I found when I

231
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:25,100
search for pentagram this you can see it

232
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,230
a lot better so inside in the middle

233
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,770
this is a regular pentagon and all

234
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:37,850
angles are 108 degrees and this is 72

235
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,830
degrees and this is 36 degrees and now

236
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,260
we need to compute the distance and the

237
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,710
distance now by which we need to move

238
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:53,540
the red rhombus up is this distance Y so

239
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,910
this distance Y is the difference

240
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,880
between the distance between this vertex

241
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,860
here and this point here yellow one yeah

242
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,300
you can see it yellow and the difference

243
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,790
between this big distance and this small

244
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,270
distance here and this big distance here

245
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:20,390
is L times sine of 36° because this

246
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,800
angle is 36 degrees all right and

247
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,430
this one the small one here is a sine of

248
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,290
36° a being the side of the Pentagon but

249
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,660
we don't know the side of the Pentagon

250
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:44,370
well we can compute it this angle is

251
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,680
half of 36 degrees so one we know that

252
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,870
this is half the side of the Pentagon so

253
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,820
it's a over two so this side the

254
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,010
hypotenuse in this triangle it's going

255
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:05,040
to be 8 over 2 over sine of 18 but the

256
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,890
side of the initial rhombus we started

257
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,329
with is a plus a over 2 over sine of 18

258
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:20,250
and we get a from this equation and I

259
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,770
never actually computed I always use us

260
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:32,070
for this and this is how I got the

261
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,450
volume the translate one and I put

262
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,400
translate between the reverting the

263
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,980
transforms for the parent and the new

264
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,250
transforms to transform it into a

265
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,510
rhombus and now all I need to add is the

266
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,790
square and the square has the center in

267
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,510
the center of its parent and of course I

268
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,480
undid the transforms from the parent but

269
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,600
this looks wrong because while it's a

270
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,090
Pentagon but it's not a regular pentagon

271
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:18,400
and we have to move it up a bit

272
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,020
so let's see by how much we need to move

273
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,070
it up this is a Pentagon and this is its

274
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,000
inner circle this is the side of the

275
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,660
Pentagon and call it a half of it is a

276
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,860
over 2 and the in radius is going to be

277
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:49,250
a over 2 over tangent of 36 so that's 13

278
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,950
points at 67 66 67 out of the initial

279
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,580
side so we need to translate it up

280
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:04,850
that's why it's with a minus so this is

281
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:11,810
the regular pentagon move on to 3d

282
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:17,070
because that's actually my topic

283
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:23,810
that was quite a long introduction down

284
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:29,530
long introduction and let's do a cube or

285
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:35,960
not it's actually pretty simple and I've

286
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,840
already written a lot about it and it's

287
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,010
really simple let's build something a

288
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,750
bit more complicated like this this is a

289
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,320
3d shape a regular 3d shape with 12

290
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,940
sides 12 Pentagon's and another regular

291
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,290
polyhedron is this one it has 20 sides

292
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:06,620
20 triangles but first let's see a few

293
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,280
more 3d shapes prisons and anti prisms

294
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,640
so what are these they both have all

295
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,150
vertices contained in just two planes

296
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,510
top line bottom plane you can see them

297
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,200
the two bases are all identical lateral

298
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,270
sides are all parallel for the prisons

299
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,190
and one base is rotated by 100 over N

300
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,620
and being the number of sides with

301
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,420
respect to the other in the case of anti

302
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,390
presence all right so let's see how I

303
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,850
get some a prism we're not gonna get the

304
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,680
full prism we're gonna get just one

305
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,090
ladder other side of the prison because

306
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,720
all the others are just the same and

307
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,940
we're gonna get a triangular prism which

308
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,970
is why we start with a triangular base

309
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:59,000
and a square lateral face the first

310
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,790
thing is we translate the base we

311
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:05,540
translate it down by half of it and now

312
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,500
we rotate it around the x axis by 90

313
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,580
degrees and we rotate it by minus 90

314
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,880
degrees because we want from the front

315
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,300
of it we wanted facing down because down

316
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,670
is going to be outside the shape this is

317
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,420
not right

318
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,670
the center is not right we need to

319
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,520
translate it back

320
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,450
by the incircle and we're done with the

321
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,020
base now this is the lateral face and we

322
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,210
rotate it by half the central angle for

323
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,460
the triangle and for the triangle the

324
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,310
central angle is 180 360 over three

325
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,550
which is 120 so half of that is going to

326
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,700
be 60 degrees and now we translate it

327
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,540
along the z-axis and it gets into

328
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,360
position and the other two we get them

329
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,330
just the same we just add the radius

330
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,660
ankle we add another on central angle so

331
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,290
it's going to be 60 plus 120 180 and

332
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,760
adding one more that's going to be minus

333
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,270
60 so this is how you get a prison

334
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,960
that's moving further we can transform a

335
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,390
prism into a cylinder if we keep

336
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,210
increasing the number of sides and

337
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,100
decreasing their width and you can see

338
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,090
how it goes here back and forth and I

339
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,490
could have get it more prasad could have

340
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,590
all got it more precise if I had used

341
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,460
more elements but didn't really want to

342
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,320
animate too many elements and we can

343
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,000
change this a bit and turn it into an

344
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,710
infinite strip but first let's see the

345
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,750
code and this is SAS because there is no

346
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,570
way in hell I'm writing 23 elements with

347
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,720
the transforms so this is the number of

348
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,930
sides and it's the number of sides RI is

349
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,730
the radius of the inner circle of the

350
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,990
polygon the CA is the central angle and

351
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,080
we compute the width of a strip and in

352
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,880
the same manner as we did here except is

353
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,000
the opposite computation it's going to

354
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,100
be the inner radius

355
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:40,950
and the transform is basically the same

356
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,500
except we take we take into account the

357
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,720
index when on for the angle and now

358
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,330
let's see the infinite strip we get this

359
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,710
oops this isn't working

360
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:05,380
oh it started working the infinite strip

361
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,230
is some starting from a cylinder and we

362
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,230
also apply a rotate around the x-axis

363
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,010
the rest of the code is just the same

364
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,169
there is just this one more rotate

365
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:23,139
around the x-axis and this of course

366
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:26,019
looks a lot better if I used a lot more

367
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:30,159
elements like this and there's a link to

368
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,630
the live demo which I'm not going to

369
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,710
click because there are a hundred

370
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,010
elements here and I'm animating it to

371
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,500
make it look more realistic and I have

372
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,510
no idea how that is going to look on a

373
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,700
projector and this is also done in the

374
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,889
same way and there is a live demo or

375
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:51,580
real them of it and it's also using like

376
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,840
really really narrow line to pixels and

377
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,320
I apply a rotate X and what this rotate

378
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,240
is going to do is going to rotate this

379
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,799
ribbon is going to make a rotated like

380
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,159
this and the translate is going to

381
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,220
translate it along the y axis which

382
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,990
changes direction because of the

383
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,809
previous rotate and it goes from going

384
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:20,799
pointing downwards this to pointing like

385
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,399
that in that direction and there is

386
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,220
going to be another rotate Y which is

387
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,980
going to rotate each line and a

388
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,929
translate which is going to position it

389
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:35,799
it would be on a circle if we were to

390
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,929
ignore the first two transforms but

391
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:39,639
there are also the first two transforms

392
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:44,259
which make it a bit of a sparrow

393
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:46,599
and there's also something like this and

394
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:49,039
I've had a toy like this when I was a

395
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,839
child and I used to play with it and

396
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:55,190
somebody challenged me one day like do

397
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,889
this with CSS so I thought alright I'll

398
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,999
do it and it's done in approximately the

399
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:05,659
same way as the ribbon except segments

400
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:11,089
are wider and I call this a worm because

401
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:12,889
we don't really have to limit ourselves

402
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:16,519
to lines and strips and squares and

403
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,859
stuff like that and we can do this stuff

404
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:22,129
at circles and my dad was revolted it's

405
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:23,719
so pretty why do you call it such an

406
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:30,139
ugly name and this the entire surface is

407
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:32,749
rotated so the initial y axis points

408
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:38,359
like this and the translate simply moves

409
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:41,479
each circle a bit more down down down

410
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:45,799
down down down down and the rotate and

411
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:50,559
rotates it like this and the translate

412
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,950
positions it on will be a circle if we

413
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,869
were to ignore this translate the first

414
00:26:56,869 --> 00:26:59,749
translate and the rotate X makes it

415
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:02,269
perpendicular and the scale makes it go

416
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:04,609
from this size the smaller smaller

417
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:06,649
smaller until you can barely see it

418
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:11,409
there and this is the last surface and

419
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:14,329
this is simply an arc because we don't

420
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:15,919
have to take the into our circle we can

421
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,429
take just an arc and taking the the arc

422
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:25,309
we are just scale it because it goes

423
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:29,989
from this long to just this line here

424
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:33,109
and then we just rotate it around itself

425
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,559
and we get this shape so now let's move

426
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,859
on if the first starship seemed a bit

427
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,769
complicated we can just stun make it

428
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:45,079
into pieces and we can split it into two

429
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,809
halves and each half is like a cup with

430
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:50,509
a Pentagon as a base and five more

431
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:54,139
Pentagon's on each side so let's see how

432
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,140
we get this we are start with the

433
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,179
and lateral face and the base we rotated

434
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:06,950
by 90 degrees and then we translated by

435
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,410
the value of the incircle and now we

436
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,280
move on to the lateral and we rotate it

437
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,490
and we translate and it's the same thing

438
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,400
as for the prism and adding adding up if

439
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:30,860
we add another angle we get 108 and 180

440
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,630
and so on the others and it's all the

441
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,610
same for the other side and the same for

442
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,919
the other half and now let's see how we

443
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,559
make into pieces the other one just

444
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:54,390
didn't start right from the beginning

445
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,450
it's like this and you split it into a

446
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:07,210
pyramid and an antifreeze

447
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,310
and maybe some of you are wondering why

448
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,900
I showed you that bowl at the beginning

449
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,840
well we can morph this shape into a ball

450
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:23,310
and this is actually not working right

451
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,740
and it was working right a few minutes

452
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:39,540
ago and I can't believe this damn it

453
00:29:39,550 --> 00:30:01,930
damnit but I do have it working right

454
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:26,970
this is it yeah this is working right
