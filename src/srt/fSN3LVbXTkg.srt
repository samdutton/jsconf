1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,620
So, yeah.

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,730
My name's Bryan Hughes, find me online in
all the places.

3
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,740
This is a talk I have been thinking about
for a long time.

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,460
Actually, first came up with like the original
kernel of an idea for this talk at this very

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,919
conference two years ago.

6
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:34,370
So, I think it's fitting that I'm able to
actually give it here at JSConf EU.

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,340
Because this is a really special conference.

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,710
I think we've all felt that.

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,160
You know, it's great technical content, of
course.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,260
Some of the leading technical content.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,190
But really, we're a community, more than that.

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,400
And so, like, as you can probably guess, especially
if you have read my Twitter bio, I'm bisexual,

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,450
polyamorous, and you can read it there.

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,890
Some things that aren't in my bio.

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,670
I was born in Texas in the United States which
is one of the most conservative parts of the

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,670
country.

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,170
I grew up there in the '80s and '90s.

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,590
A little older than I look.

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,039
Things were a little bit different back then.

20
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:15,929
I'm going to talk about queerness and tech
and how these things intersect in all kinds

21
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,060
of different ways.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,970
The truth is it's complicated.

23
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,259
There's no binary tech is good, tech is bad
or any of that.

24
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:26,090
It's just all over the map.

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,759
I really want to dig into what these things
are, really.

26
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,060
How tech helps, how tech hurts and how tech
can be better.

27
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,260
I'm just one person.

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,830
We talk about the queer community a lot.

29
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,430
But it's not just one community.

30
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,060
Not just one type of person in it.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,889
The queer community is a federation, really.

32
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:49,469
There are lots and lots of different communities
with a lot of different people and a lot of

33
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:50,469
different experiences.

34
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:53,630
Of course, disclaimer, I speak for myself.

35
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,729
I did reach out to a number of queer folks
that I know, friends of friends, things like

36
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,720
that, to try to get a lot of different perspectives.

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,939
You'll see quotes from other folks.

38
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,799
Hopefully not just speaking for myself.

39
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,430
Before we get into it, this talk comes with
content warnings as I'm sure you can imagine.

40
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:18,000
So, if any of these parts of the talk are
difficult or uncomfortable, take care of yourself.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,480
Feel free to step outside, anything like that.

42
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,570
I want to start by setting the stage a little
bit.

43
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,849
Go back in time a little bit.

44
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,940
Talk about one of the fathers of computer
science, Alan Turing.

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,680
Made contributions to computer science as
well as art official intelligence.

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,090
The renaissance in tech, artificial intelligence,
the big new thing.

47
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,620
Alan Turing was talking about it in the first
part of the 20th century.

48
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,590
And Alan Turing was also gay.

49
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,189
And he was persecuted for it.

50
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:57,870
It.

51
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:19,890
I think in a way it's fitting that we start
by talking about tech and queer employees

52
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,190
given in the way that Alan Turing was the
first queer tech employee.

53
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,939
At least that we know of.

54
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:32,239
When we talk about being a queer employee,
tech is very complicated, you know?

55
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,150
I'm queer and I'm a tech employee.

56
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,980
I think a lot of folks in this audience here
are.

57
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,140
And so, it's really complicated.

58
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,000
Like the first thing I want to talk about
one of the best things is that tech offers

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,709
us stable employment.

60
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,090
And as queer folks, this is really important
because a lot of queer folks are just not

61
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,849
financially stable.

62
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,879
Regardless of the family we come from, so
many were, you know, kicked out of their homes

63
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,879
when they were young.

64
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,540
So, even if there was wealth in the family,
that often didn't translate to the queer kids

65
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,209
themselves.

66
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,780
Having financial stability is important.

67
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,270
And in tech, compared to other professions
that pay about the same and offer the stability,

68
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,700
tech tends to be one of the most accepting.

69
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,780
At least in that strata of professions.

70
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:24,620
As a queer tech worker, I have a job that
is intellectually challenging and offers economic

71
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,150
stability.

72
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,170
I do my best to pay it forward and pass that
money along to people who need it.

73
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:39,380
One of the first issues that we tend to run
into, and this is kind of a meta one, is corporate

74
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,250
pride is rainbow capitalism.

75
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,300
All right.

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,199
Throughout I think about three different definitions
to use to break this down a little bit.

77
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,040
First, the concept of pride in the queer community.

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,050
That's really, really important to us.

79
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,780
Because for centuries and millennia, we were
told that who we are is something to be ashamed

80
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,139
of.

81
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,139
It's not.

82
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,490
And it's taken a lot of work for us to become
proud of who we are.

83
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,940
And so, pride is very, very important us to.

84
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:14,530
And we're starting to see a lot of companies
expressing queer pride in various different

85
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,530
ways.

86
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,030
So, this corporate pride is kind of it's a
new thing, of course.

87
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,970
But we really look at it, though, it's what
we call rainbow capitalism.

88
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:30,880
And so, rainbow capitalism is whenever companies,
institutions, whoever, engages with the queer

89
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
community.

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,120
Not to help the queer community.

91
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,070
But in order to further their own interests.

92
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,810
Usually to sell more products, make more money.

93
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,949
And what we end up seeing is that corporate
pride end up just being another reflection

94
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:46,780
and lens of rainbow capitalism.

95
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,240
The tech industry is engaging in a queer specific
version of diversity theater by sponsoring

96
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,560
events like the pride parade.

97
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:01,110
They market to sell more products, and most
are not doing anything to make the life better

98
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,350
for queer people.

99
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,300
Queer ERGs, employee resource groups, should
be run by queer employees.

100
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,650
However, it's also important that you value
the work people are putting into this.

101
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,450
I was the head of the queer employee resource
group for a while.

102
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:24,060
And that work was seen as completely extracurricular
and I missed out on a promotion as a result.

103
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,810
See, companies want to take the work they
do in order to further their own interests

104
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,180
and they don't actually give back.

105
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,509
They don't support us in that.

106
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:36,080
They only take it from us.

107
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,960
And our other intersections are compounded.

108
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,879
You know, we talk about social justice.

109
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,250
We talk a lot about intersectionality.

110
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,220
And that absolutely applies to queerness as
well.

111
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,310
And one of the things that I think is important
to note about this is, you know, we tend to

112
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,100
think about diversity, inclusivity as like
different axes.

113
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,300
This is not necessarily wrong, but they are
not independent.

114
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,139
And this is something we have to remember.

115
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,440
When people have more than one marginalization
they're dealing, this is not an additive,

116
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,910
it's a multiplicative one.

117
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:14,060
They inform each other and makes things more
complicated.

118
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,699
When my disability became ongoing, it was
hard to tell if I was put on small projects

119
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:27,729
because of my disability, gender, or actual
job performance.

120
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:32,169
I'm definitely more marginalized for my Judaism
and ADHD, but that's only because I have been

121
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:37,169
working in queer friendly cities.

122
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,229
I'm marginalized for both my queerness and
my race.

123
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:42,949
Queer rights isn't an equal playing field.

124
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:51,580
Race always had something to do with it.

125
00:07:51,580 --> 00:08:22,069
Our pain is ignored and dismissed.

126
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:25,860
Just after the Pulse nightclub shootings,
I mentioned to a co worker that I was going

127
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,990
hold a moment of silence at an upcoming all
hands.

128
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,010
My co worker said, I don't think tech companies
should take a stance on that kind of thing.

129
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,039
I like the idea of being neutral.

130
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,779
What the fuck?

131
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,329
I didn't say anything because I didn't feel
safe to speak up to this person that thinks

132
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:50,300
companies shouldn't condemn gun violence against
queer people of color.

133
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,779
Tech is never neutral.

134
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,270
And the only way you can think that tech is
neutral is if you love in a place of extreme

135
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,779
privilege.

136
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,120
Tech is a part of this world.

137
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,550
It always has been.

138
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,760
[ Applause ]
And it shape this is world in a way that no

139
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,120
industry does in this day and age.

140
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,310
And, you know, actually, I should say something
else on this.

141
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,709
I actually have my own story with Pulse as
well.

142
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,040
I had been working at Microsoft for three,
four months.

143
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,580
I was working on a product team before I got
into my current role now.

144
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,500
And Pulse nightclub shooting happened on a
weekend.

145
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,850
And I think every queer person remembers that
weekend pretty clearly.

146
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,700
At least if you were connected to the queer
community at that time.

147
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,890
I was working on a remote team, something
I was grateful for in retrospect.

148
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,510
And we had a stand up Monday morning.

149
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,320
I'm devastated.

150
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,350
Every queer person I know and talked to was
a complete and utter wreck.

151
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,990
I hop on the call, a virtual call, thankfully
no video.

152
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:03,560
I'm barely able to speak, and all the people
on the team, all cis straight men, they were

153
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,750
asking about weekends, laughing and joking
as if nothing had happened.

154
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,890
And like I'm struggling so much already.

155
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,930
And that made me feel so much more alone in
that moment.

156
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,670
Because it was a reminder that, you know,
most people aren't queer.

157
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,680
Most people don't have to deal with that.

158
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,670
And most people don't care.

159
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,209
So, what can tech employers do?

160
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:35,040
First, let's talk about hiring.

161
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,140
And this is just a few things.

162
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,829
Like we could spend an entire talk on this
alone.

163
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:41,100
I'll just give you a couple of things.

164
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,780
First of all is ignore social media.

165
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,120
Like, if you're higher, just don't even look
at a person's social media account.

166
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,930
Because the truth is, if we're going to talk
about our daily lives, that means talking

167
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,510
about some things that people find controversial.

168
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,760
If we're not going to talk about our daily
lives like privileged, straight, cis white

169
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:03,389
folks do, we get punished in ways they don't
or we have to hide it, which is effectively

170
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:04,550
going back in the closet.

171
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,180
If we talk about other marginalizations on
top of it, it's even worse.

172
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,010
On my bio on Twitter, I mention that I'm bi
and poly.

173
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,010
I try to be out about that.

174
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,170
But you know what with?

175
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,130
If a bi queer woman, especially of color said
the same thing, that would probably disqualify

176
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,010
them from being hired, but not me.

177
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,490
The other thing is to understand variances
in employment history.

178
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,329
This is especially true for trans folks.

179
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:37,980
Because the truth of the matter is queer folks
in general have a tougher time finding employment.

180
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,079
There are more issues we have to deal with.

181
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,529
And the more marginalized intersections it
is, the more difficult.

182
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:50,410
People are in bad situations at work and are
discriminated and have to leave.

183
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,079
Especially the more marginalized followings
tend to hop jobs.

184
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,420
It's not the fault of the queer folks, but
it's the companies.

185
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,910
And in hiring, the queer person is punished
all the time.

186
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,640
We need to stop looking at that.

187
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,149
And talk about HR once in the company.

188
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,370
Implicit bias training.

189
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,800
This is kind of an obvious one.

190
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,020
And there are a lot of problems with current
implicit bias trainings.

191
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,180
But this is still important.

192
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,680
We all have biases.

193
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,970
This is the nature of the human condition.

194
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,220
Every single person has some biases.

195
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,640
We can't understand everyone's viewpoint in
the world.

196
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,370
We didn't simultaneously grow up in every
single country to simultaneously being born

197
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,889
to dozens of different types of parents.

198
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,639
We cannot understand everyone's position innately.

199
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,040
We don't have the experiences.

200
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,529
And the best way to get through that is through
education.

201
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,890
And also, we need to improve implicit bias
training.

202
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,360
And also, we need to take sexual harassment
claims seriously.

203
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,760
This is especially true for clear women.

204
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,740
Because this is an issue in the industry for
all women.

205
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,360
But again, intersectionality.

206
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
This comes into play.

207
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,950
Queer women face even more issues.

208
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:08,160
There was I remember a study came out a while
ago that showed bi women actually face more

209
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,029
discrimination than lesbian or straight women
as it turns out.

210
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:15,600
There's a whole complicated host of reasons
for that.

211
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
But it's true.

212
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,550
And so, taking these claims seriously benefits
queer people especially.

213
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,930
And people of color and other intersections
as well.

214
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,930
Inclusion.

215
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,079
You know, gender neutral language and bedrooms.

216
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,850
We have gender neutral bedrooms here at the
conference.

217
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,649
It's actually part of the venue.

218
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,339
They didn't do that last minute switch that
a lot of conferences did.

219
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:40,660
You can do it at a concert venue, you can
do it at work.

220
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,430
And the same thing with language.

221
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,430
Don't use he, him in documentation language.

222
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,649
Depending on the language, this is a little
bit different.

223
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,430
Some languages it's easier to do gender neutral
pronouns than others.

224
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,710
Regardless, think about what they're talking
about in the language and the culture and

225
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,210
figure out how to support them with language.

226
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,360
Preferred names and pronouns.

227
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,709
This is important in companies and comes up
in a lot of places we don't think about.

228
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:13,500
For legal reasons, most companies need your
legal name.

229
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,300
A trans person, their legal name is often
not their real name.

230
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,840
We need to understand that and propagate that
through a system.

231
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,690
If you have HR systems to log in, show their
preferred name there, not the legal name.

232
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:33,820
In their email, corporate email account, show
your preferred name and not your legal name

233
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,589
and so on and so forth.

234
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,170
Create queer only spaces.

235
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,850
I bet a lot of us use Slack at work.

236
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,500
Make sure in the Slacks there's a queer only
space.

237
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,130
Same for other marginalizations.

238
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,860
We need a space to talk about ourselves where
we're not constantly having to do one on one

239
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,980
education.

240
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,089
And let queer people speak and listen.

241
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,300
Stop speaking and listen.

242
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,770
Stop thinking you know what's best for queer
people at your company.

243
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,520
Let's back out and talk about tech in the
broader queer community.

244
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:14,050
This is one of the biggest benefits of tech
and the most transformation I have seen.

245
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,980
Tech lets us escape our isolation.

246
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,380
This is a big difference, when I was kid to
when I was in college.

247
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,050
When I was a kid, there was no Internet.

248
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,800
Even when I was in high school, it wasn't
really there.

249
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,870
But now we can actually find community online.

250
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,160
And this is deeply powerful.

251
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,920
Tech makes it easier to find and meet community.

252
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,320
Grinder, et cetera, make finding like minded
people or people with the same sexuality is

253
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,080
a lot easier than flagging my friend Dorothy.

254
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,730
There's a reason, read up on it.

255
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,910
Tech makes it easier to find porn which helps
with sexuality discovery.

256
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,910
This is important.

257
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,441
A lot of people don't think about it.

258
00:15:57,441 --> 00:16:02,860
But when we grow up in a society when we are
supposed to have a certain orientation, certain

259
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,100
sexual desires.

260
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,110
We have to dispel with that.

261
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,440
We have to figure something else.

262
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,230
And interestingly enough, porn is a really
good way to do that.

263
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,889
And porn is tied into tech.

264
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:21,610
So, we need to this is so useful in so many
ways.

265
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,050
Queer folks spend most of our lives in some
form of social isolation due to the hostility

266
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,290
and violation of the cis hetero normative
society we are forced to live in.

267
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:37,339
Having tech for a space to be ourselves and
meet people like us matters.

268
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,760
Tech has a lot of isolated people, allowing
them to find thousands or millions of others

269
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,589
just like themselves.

270
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,350
Queer folks of all types have found a large,
receptive community to help them feel normalized

271
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,230
and legitimate.

272
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:55,009
The trans rights movements has advanced due
to the isolated people finding a multitude

273
00:16:55,009 --> 00:17:01,660
of peers going through the same process.

274
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,820
But tech asserts its biases on the world.

275
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:12,500
I think the biggest harm is training AI systems
that incorporate existing bias and then treating

276
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,710
those systems as Oracles and always correct.

277
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,820
Also, unlike with human interactions where
you can negotiate, if a tech solution isn't

278
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,800
coded to do something, there's no way to do
it.

279
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,300
If you're a queer, non binary or trans person
signing up for a service and they have only

280
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,630
a male/female check button, you can't talk
to the website and have that button appear.

281
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,760
It's not there.

282
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,090
You don't do it.

283
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:44,000
It's driven by powerful cis men, and the tech
is baked with the world they create.

284
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,780
And put out into the world via the Internet.

285
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:57,940
It's a small portion of the straight world
who is setting that culture.

286
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,521
Tech is also explicit in gentrification.

287
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:05,440
Now, gentrification is a complicated topic
and there's not just one single cause.

288
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,120
But tech absolutely does play a role in it.

289
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,940
Societally some of the safest spaces for queer
communities are in big cities like New York

290
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,830
and San Francisco and, yes, here in Berlin.

291
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:22,010
However, tech is hyper gentrifying those areas,
making it impossible for queer folks to live.

292
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,760
When queer folks can't live in places that
are safe for them, they have to live in places

293
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,880
that are not safe for them.

294
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,530
I live in San Francisco.

295
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,700
My local community pretty much got destroyed
by gentrification, along with everything else

296
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,680
that's good and beautiful.

297
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,880
I live in San Francisco.

298
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,720
And I have to agree.

299
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,080
Social media tech refuses to fix hate and
bullying.

300
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,430
Online spaces have been increasingly hostile
towards marginalized groups speaking up about

301
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,730
their expressions, and that's fucking shitty.

302
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:03,621
I have seen friends and friends of friends
stand up against white supremacists, tech

303
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:09,280
doesn't ban the Nazis, they ban the queer
people standing up for themselves.

304
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,200
I've seen this many times.

305
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,000
The tech industry is profiting from social
media platforms that enable harassment of

306
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,210
queer and trans people as well as spreading
fascist ideologies.

307
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,350
The tech industry has the power and resources
to quarantine harassment and hate speech.

308
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,850
We do it with Spam in email.

309
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:37,780
It's just harassment and hate speech don't
affect the white men in charge of the industry.

310
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,490
And the harm of viralness is intersectional.

311
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,500
I think we've all heard various stories in
the media about someone does something, says

312
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
something, whatever.

313
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
It goes viral.

314
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,570
And then their lives are ruined.

315
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,931
This is compounded by intersectionality.

316
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:55,540
There's a lot of stories I could tell.

317
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,550
There's actually a very specific story I want
to tell, though.

318
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:03,980
About two months ago a trans black woman in
Dallas, my hometown.

319
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,310
I grew up in Dallas.

320
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:12,800
Her name was Malaysia Booker, assaulted in
a parking lot and someone recorded it and

321
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,960
it went viral.

322
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,800
After the attack, she had this to say.

323
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,190
This time I can stand before you when I was
attacked.

324
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:30,570
Whereas in other scenarios, we are at a memorial.

325
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:52,870
So, what can tech companies do?

326
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,980
The first is safety.

327
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,650
And start by banning the Nazis.

328
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,170
Get rid of real name policies.

329
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,370
Like Facebook still has a real name policy.

330
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,480
And I use Facebook, these are not people's
real names, they're legal names.

331
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,790
And I've seen this abused in many ways.

332
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,740
Trans people are banned from Twitter because
they dare to use their real name.

333
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,690
And speak out against anti queer legislation.

334
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,420
We're seeing more and more anti queer legislation
in the United States, here in Europe and around

335
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,260
the world.

336
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,910
And there is precedence for this, by the way.

337
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,140
A year or two ago in the United States when
some of the really bad anti immigration policy

338
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,300
was first being force the through, Microsoft
released statements condemning that.

339
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,240
We should do that with anti queer legislation
too.

340
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,820
And, again, ban the fucking Nazis.

341
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,820
It's 2019.

342
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,920
Why are we having this conversation again?

343
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,220
And respect.

344
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,940
Stop using us as props to promote yourselves.

345
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,660
We are not things in your game.

346
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,090
And put your money where your mouth is.

347
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,860
Companies will spend tens of thousands of
dollars on one float in one pride parade.

348
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,290
Yes, they actually cost that much.

349
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,290
But you know what?

350
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:04,810
They don't give a single dollar to any nonprofit
that actually helps queer people.

351
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,410
They only want to look good.

352
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,730
They don't give a shit about us.

353
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,720
So, like, where will the future take us?

354
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,990
And, you know, this is something I'm torn
on myself.

355
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,860
I don't know where we're going to end up in
all of this.

356
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,850
Some days I'm pessimistic.

357
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,850
Some days I'm hopeful.

358
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,640
And today I'm going choose to be hopeful,
though.

359
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:35,621
I want to read you some excerpts from a speech
from some time ago by Harvey Milk who was

360
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,370
a famous queer activist.

361
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:42,580
And I think he had a lot of really good things
to say.

362
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,980
Like every other group, we must be judged
by our leaders and by those who are themselves

363
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,140
gay.

364
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,270
Those who are visible.

365
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,260
For invisible, we remain in limbo.

366
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,980
A myth.

367
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,000
A person with no parents, no brothers, no
sisters.

368
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,810
No friends who are straight.

369
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,030
No important positions in employment.

370
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,970
The anger and the frustrations that some of
us feel is because we are misunderstood.

371
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,660
And friends can't feel the anger and frustration.

372
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,740
They can sense it in us.

373
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,410
But they can't feel it.

374
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,610
Because a friend has never gone through what
is known as coming out.

375
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:25,090
I will never forget what it was like coming
out and having nobody to look up toward.

376
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,270
I remember the lack of hope.

377
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,750
Our friends can't fulfill it.

378
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:37,270
I can't forget the looks on faces of people
who've lost hope.

379
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,300
Be they gay, be they seniors.

380
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,620
Be they black folks looking for an almost
impossible job.

381
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,380
Be they Latinos trying to explain their problems
and aspirations in tongue that's foreign to

382
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,740
them.

383
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,030
I use the word "I" because I'm proud.

384
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,030
I stand here tonight in front of my gay sisters,
brothers and friends because I'm proud of

385
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,710
you.

386
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:06,700
In San Francisco, three days before gay pride
day, a person was killed just because he was

387
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,430
gay.

388
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,170
And that night I walked among the sad and
the frustrated at city hall in San Francisco.

389
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:17,500
And later that night as they lit candles on
Castro Street and stood in silence.

390
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,380
Reaching out for some symbolic thing to give
them hope.

391
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,330
These were strong people.

392
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,160
These faces I knew from the shop, the streets,
meetings.

393
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,520
And people who I never saw before, but I knew.

394
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
They were strong.

395
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,780
But even they needed hope.

396
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,830
And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias,
and the Richmond, Minnesotas, who are coming

397
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:48,530
out and hearing the story on television, the
only thing they have to look forward to is

398
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,530
hope.

399
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,520
And you have to give them hope.

400
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,670
Hope for a better world, hope for a better
tomorrow.

401
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,760
Hope for a better place to come to if the
pressures at home are too great.

402
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,220
Hope that all will be all right.

403
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:11,560
So, without hope, not only gays, but blacks,
Asians, seniors, the handicapped, the uses.

404
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,070
The uses will give up.

405
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:20,540
If there's a message I have to give, is that
I found one overriding thing about my personal

406
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,380
election, if a gay person can be elected,
it's a green light.

407
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:40,610
And you and you and you you have to give 'em
hope.

408
00:25:40,610 --> 00:26:00,690
Thank you.
