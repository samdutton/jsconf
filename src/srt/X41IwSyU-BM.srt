00:00:12,990 --> 00:02:27,940

music

2
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,300
thank you very much so music as I said

3
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,520
how many of you in here would consider

4
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,490
themselves to be musicians in some way

5
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,700
well quite a lot of hands I expected

6
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,720
your hand to go up pull great so how

7
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,770
many of you actively play an instrument

8
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,450
on a regular basis so it should be you

9
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,460
know they're a little more a few more

10
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,620
hands there because you know I I don't

11
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,400
consider myself a musician somehow not

12
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,180
properly trained and all but usually

13
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,460
when I speak to a crowd like this there

14
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,260
are an astonishing number of hands going

15
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,060
up and you'reyou're not an exception

16
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,650
here and I find this kind of interesting

17
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,900
because I think playing music and and

18
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,940
programming computers somehow goes well

19
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,490
together I I still didn't figure it out

20
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,250
completely but you know sometimes a job

21
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,470
is very stressing and music can be very

22
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,780
relaxing and on the other hand a lot of

23
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,580
music is based on mathematics and we

24
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,290
usually like mathematics and stuff like

25
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,810
that so it goes well together I think

26
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,610
now with myself sorry my my I have a

27
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,800
little coat here my voice might be

28
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,200
failing so I'm going to play a bit more

29
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,530
music later on but I don't have to talk

30
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,760
so myself I started learning to play the

31
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,430
flute in elementary school who shares

32
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,470
this yeah and I hated it I hated it I

33
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,260
really hated it and so as soon as I

34
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,000
could quit this I quit it and I've never

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,740
started to learn an instrument again

36
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,250
it's it's just I I cannot tell you how

37
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,850
much I hated it and I I basically so

38
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,060
this is I have probably noted it wrong

39
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,680
but this is the the tune and the fourth

40
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,580
in the way of what you say fourth year

41
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,820
in school we had to play our best flute

42
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,130
tune we were able to do thank you and

43
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,630
that was one I learned in first grade

44
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,599
and I

45
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,580
just because I was so fed up with this

46
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,419
so anyway so I stopped doing music at

47
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,339
all for a few years and then I somehow

48
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:53,830
got back into it and the reason was that

49
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,069
I got my first home computer which was

50
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:01,929
of course looking at my age of c64 who

51
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:07,179
else had a c64 just a few hands how many

52
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,729
of you are actually born in the 70s this

53
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:12,089
kind of interesting information yeah

54
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:17,680
getting old and so we had this

55
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,169
awesome magazine in Germany called feein

56
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,159
zeiss tiga magazine who remembers that

57
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:26,800
okay a few hands and you know that back

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,789
in the days so when you found computer

59
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,979
listings and computer magazines that

60
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,110
were actually not there to tell the

61
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,930
point or something but for you to type

62
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,939
into your computer to get new programs

63
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,639
that was the main way of distributing

64
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,610
software like printing listings than

65
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,589
magazine let that sink in for a minute

66
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:53,439
if you're born in the 90s so this

67
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,719
magazine even had their own program that

68
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:58,029
enabled you to input binary data so they

69
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:59,409
have this program where you would type

70
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:03,430
in large columns of of hex numbers with

71
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,180
checksums to input a program that was

72
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,680
not written in basic so you couldn't

73
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,749
really type it into the computer easily

74
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:14,110
and I did that with one program because

75
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,819
I really really wanted to have this

76
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:17,529
program and it took me about two weeks

77
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:21,519
to type in this several page long hex

78
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,189
listing and the program was called sound

79
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,430
monitor or anyone remember that I

80
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,409
thought so it was written by a gentleman

81
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:32,019
called Chris Hills back does that name

82
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,439
ring a bell for anyone okay I thought so

83
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,959
so if you have never heard that name he

84
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,079
is the guy who wrote the soundtrack for

85
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,449
games like great giant assisters you've

86
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,009
probably heard didn't hear of that

87
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,789
either taarakian have you heard of that

88
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:53,050
well yeah I don't know he was pretty

89
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,430
popular at that time and what

90
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,440
the first freely available software to

91
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,800
do proper music on the c64 where you can

92
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,630
basically do everything with the

93
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,130
hardware that the hardware's actually

94
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,140
able to do and the hardware the sound

95
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,840
hardware and the c64 was a three voice

96
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,090
analog synthesizer with filters in all

97
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,670
and that's that's the most amazing sound

98
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,760
source you can have in the 90's in the

99
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,130
80s and so I started making music with

100
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,710
this tool and then I later on I got an

101
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,670
Amiga so I'm that type of guy not an

102
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,620
Atari which would be the better choice

103
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,110
probably for making music but this Amiga

104
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,600
had for digital voices and you could do

105
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,550
all some stuff with it and it was this

106
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,950
free software called pro tracker and the

107
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,690
interface to put in music looks like

108
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,080
this and it's it's basically columns of

109
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,540
numbers and sound monitor was a very

110
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,550
very thinly disguised machine monitor

111
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,020
with some some yeah basic ways to input

112
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,610
notes and it looked a little like this

113
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,430
and pro tracker just improved a little

114
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,170
bit in that it had buttons you could

115
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,940
actually click with the mouse to do

116
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,130
certain things but apart from that it's

117
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,650
it's just writing down numbers to make

118
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,630
music and I did that throughout the

119
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,440
whole 90s into the 2000s and made a lot

120
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,860
of music with that and it's yeah it's

121
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,320
you can see notes there and octaves and

122
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,700
you can see the sample number it should

123
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,890
play and then there are three columns to

124
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,900
do effects on top of that and then

125
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,880
there's the next column and you had four

126
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,550
tracks of these and very very basic way

127
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:33,090
to input sound and at some point I

128
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,130
thought well this is this actually looks

129
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,800
an awful lot like programming you know

130
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,340
it's it's just typing in stuff to

131
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,930
instruct the computer to do something

132
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,050
and wouldn't it be awesome to just write

133
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,260
code to make music and I wasn't the only

134
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,220
one to think that and so somewhere

135
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,790
around I would say mid 90s maybe I don't

136
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,610
know the exact history of this people

137
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,340
started building life coding

138
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,190
environments for music and I

139
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,170
I looked at a few of them and probably

140
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,050
the the emergence of these tool came

141
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,820
together with the emergence of being

142
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,330
able to calculate sounds in real time on

143
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,160
a computer that wasn't possible before

144
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,770
the mid-90s something like that so you

145
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,900
could do music without having any

146
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,370
external hardware that was unthinkable

147
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,700
at that time and suddenly we could do it

148
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,410
and then it makes an awful lot of sense

149
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,670
to to try to do live coding with it one

150
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,780
of the best-known

151
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,880
live coding tools for the Mac is

152
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,540
impromptu it's based on scheme and then

153
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,820
there's a thing called supercollider if

154
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,200
you're interested in this type of stuff

155
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,180
please take a look at it supercollider

156
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,880
is super awesome and super complicated

157
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,630
and really hard to get into and then

158
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,520
there's this other thing and I forgot to

159
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,410
look up the name and I could beat myself

160
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,170
up for it which is based on closure so

161
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,500
another list dialect and it's written on

162
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,690
top of supercollider does anyone know

163
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,700
the name and could shout it to me that

164
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,810
was my chance so overtone right

165
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,960
it's called overtone thank you very much

166
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,310
he googled it great you're my you're my

167
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,280
Google assistant from now on thank you

168
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,340
very much so when I when I in this

169
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,620
February had the chance to to play a

170
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,980
live gig with two other gentlemen were

171
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,450
playing accordion and electric bass at a

172
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,140
post conference event at the Google

173
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,900
campus in Tel Aviv I thought oh maybe

174
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,270
it's time to come up with something that

175
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,850
allows live coding in the browser and so

176
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,310
I came up with this very very basic

177
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,340
system it's not a lot of code actually

178
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,960
it's on github and going to show you

179
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,650
some music

180
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,200
so the thing with live coding music is

181
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,210
that it takes a lot of time and I

182
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,580
thought I could probably do it from

183
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,100
scratch for you turns out I'm not

184
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,410
unnerve Asst enough to do that so I'm

185
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,270
going to I'm going to show you a bit

186
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,209
what what this is doing so the thing

187
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,240
about live coding is and and using

188
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,950
something like JavaScript for doing this

189
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,779
is that you can actually use code to

190
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,740
produce stuff obviously and so this you

191
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,410
can take an array and then feed it into

192
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,490
something else and art is just a small

193
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,020
extraction I wrote to to build an

194
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,470
appreciator if that rings a bell and it

195
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:17,110
sounds like this and what this what this

196
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,990
does here is so spread strength is just

197
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,480
another abstraction that does takes a

198
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,240
few oscillators puts it into a few

199
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,830
filters and there's the thing about

200
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,110
coding against the Web Audio API I've

201
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,000
ever done that the code is really

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,580
verbose and it's really hard to to cut

203
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,130
it down so it's it's procedural code to

204
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,760
set up stuff it's yeah it's almost

205
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,740
declarative more or less and so it's

206
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,600
really good if you're doing live coding

207
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,339
to abstract it away in things that are a

208
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,120
little easier on on the eye and on the

209
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,250
on the fingers so I'm going to start

210
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,140
this again and just improvise a little

211
00:12:56,140 --> 00:14:08,370
bit on this

212
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,250
thank you for the applause and the cool

213
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,770
thing again it's it's you know it's cold

214
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,900
and mathematic so what about if I mess

215
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:23,600
this up a little bit and it's like much

216
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,790
more interesting you know I I like

217
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:32,180
techno but

218
00:14:32,190 --> 00:17:49,060
that won't work

219
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,590
so finally my hands are in a state where

220
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,629
it can actually type things it's good

221
00:17:54,629 --> 00:18:00,240
it's good so let's talk a little bit or

222
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,799
let me talk a little bit about the

223
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,049
technology behind this so this is

224
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,379
pattern based music and this is very you

225
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,559
know at since since Roland

226
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,389
built these awesome drum machines called

227
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:15,990
808 and 909 this has been like the modus

228
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,649
operandi fo for electronic electronic

229
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:22,169
music at least in the drum section and

230
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,000
so this is a very simple drum pattern

231
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,299
and the characteristics of this is that

232
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,669
you have slots in time we can attach

233
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,529
events to and usually the events is

234
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:34,139
trigger a sample or trigger a note or

235
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:37,500
something and so this is one thing you

236
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,750
you have to do when you want to build a

237
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,340
system like this you have to have a

238
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,379
possibilities to schedule events at

239
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,960
certain times and the Web Audio API is

240
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,940
pretty good at that so that's that's

241
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,659
kind of cool

242
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:52,740
now usually music can be a lot more

243
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,100
interesting than that by varying things

244
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,009
in between and you know this could this

245
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,779
could be everything you know this this

246
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:05,460
is a not a sine wave this is something I

247
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,970
came up with last late night I guess so

248
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,309
it's it's a modulation of some kind of

249
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:12,720
parameter it could be a filter frequency

250
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,419
it could be the frequency of a note or

251
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,100
something but the the the most important

252
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,379
part here is that you want to vary

253
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,269
things over the boundaries of these

254
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,940
pattern slots so they need there needs

255
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,879
to be a way to schedule not only events

256
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,730
at certain times but also changes over

257
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,360
time and luckily the Web Audio API has

258
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,870
have it has covered so this is my very

259
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,360
scientific diagram of how stuff in the

260
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,429
Web Audio API works and I've now

261
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:49,919
realized that probably you can't read

262
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,690
the names of the methods I wrote down

263
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:59,100
there too bad so if you how many of you

264
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,080
have seen the tour from yon at bluejack

265
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,070
jeaious

266
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:08,100
on Thursday so a few so there there is

267
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,330
this idea that the the audio context

268
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,370
which is the the basic object from which

269
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,950
you construct all the objects in the Web

270
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,920
Audio API has this idea of its own time

271
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,100
context and you can always ask it what

272
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,760
time it is

273
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,530
that's pretty kind of good what time is

274
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,310
is its I don't know 5 SEC's then 5

275
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,460
seconds and 50 milliseconds since I've

276
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,830
been started and this is current time so

277
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,510
it's an attribute you can just read out

278
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,520
and it gives you the current time now

279
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,350
with this you can actually start

280
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,090
scheduling things in the future because

281
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,430
now you know ok this is now and I want

282
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,080
to start something in 2 seconds and I

283
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,460
just take current time and add two

284
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,700
seconds to it and it's floating-point

285
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,060
mathematics so in theory it should get

286
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,070
really really imprecise after a long

287
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,060
time and I've seen box on browser bark

288
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,100
trackers that actually try to deal with

289
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,990
this because it's kind of hairy so if

290
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,910
you let it run for two hours and it get

291
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,830
gets off by more than 20 milliseconds or

292
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,080
so the beat starts to crumble and that's

293
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,580
not good and now if you want to start a

294
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,890
sound and stop a sound you can do so by

295
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,050
just saying okay current time plus X and

296
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,960
that's the top one so you have a start

297
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,510
and a stop event now if you want to

298
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,730
change parameters most of the parameters

299
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,340
in the Web Audio API as what what's

300
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,210
called an audio param element audio

301
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,100
param class which is kind of cool

302
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,290
because it allows you to schedule not

303
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,140
only events but also changes into the

304
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,590
future and so there is if you say dot

305
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,330
value you've probably seen me typing

306
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,210
that once it just sets the value

307
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,600
immediately if you say set value at time

308
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,800
that's a that's a method call then you

309
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,960
can say okay I want this value to be X

310
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,920
at time Z Y and that's the and it the

311
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,380
the idea is that it changes the value in

312
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,750
a way that the audio doesn't click so it

313
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,150
will not change it immediately like from

314
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,570
one

315
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,150
to 0 but from 1 to 0 in like a few

316
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,980
milliseconds and that's kind of nice

317
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,510
because you don't have to worry about

318
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,920
that and then you have also the

319
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,690
possibility to say okay I want this

320
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,210
value to gradually change over time and

321
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,790
there are linear changes so linear ramp

322
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,540
to value at time that's a pretty great

323
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,990
method name if you ask me and

324
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,370
exponential ramp to value at time and

325
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,930
then there are a few others that allow

326
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,990
you to to Eve be even more creative with

327
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,630
these things and the exponential one is

328
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,670
extremely interesting because in music

329
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,400
you always you often deal with values

330
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,260
like frequencies or so where it makes a

331
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,970
lot of sense to not linearly interpolate

332
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,630
but do it exponentially so that's kind

333
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:08,190
of very cool to have and with this you

334
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,760
can actually do best of both worlds so

335
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,300
you can schedule events on precise

336
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,040
timings and then change values over time

337
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,620
and everything you've heard like the

338
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,500
small filter phase at the start of a

339
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,450
note that is basically me scheduling

340
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,880
filter changes over time and that's all

341
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,740
happening in my abstractions and and

342
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,260
they are quite easy to handle now

343
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,780
there's a problem if you want to

344
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,850
actually make music and change

345
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,180
parameters over time in real time let's

346
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,980
say you have this controller and you

347
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,350
want to change things with knobs then

348
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,270
you suddenly have a problem of well I've

349
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,370
just I can schedule things in the future

350
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,010
but what do I do with these button

351
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,950
thingies here and or with with knobs or

352
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,260
with sliders or whatever and it that's

353
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,450
actually a problem that is not very easy

354
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,420
to solve for reasons that are quite

355
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:09,050
complex trying to explain them anyway so

356
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,640
there are basically two categories of

357
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,210
categories of notes in the Web Audio API

358
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,160
one is the generator part which are

359
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,870
disposable so you start the sound you

360
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,760
stop a sound and the object is basically

361
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,700
gone or can be can be thrown away

362
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,500
because it cannot start it again it's

363
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,340
not it's not

364
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,950
usable and the problem with that is if I

365
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,140
want to attach a value in real time to

366
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,970
it I have to reattach it every time I

367
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,710
create a new object and this can be

368
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,490
quite complicated and then there's this

369
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,490
other category like filters or effects

370
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,650
that can actually exist for a very long

371
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,570
time and there it's not so much of a

372
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,070
problem because you have that one object

373
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,880
you can talk to at all time and I really

374
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,640
didn't solve this problem very good

375
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,040
so I to show you that it's it's

376
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,200
basically possible to do that I have a

377
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,970
last example that will hopefully show a

378
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,710
few of these things better so again I

379
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,050
don't start from scratch because I don't

380
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:22,590
want to bore you to for too long here so

381
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:36,520
you've heard that before

382
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:42,630
and the clap snare you're hearing there

383
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,770
is actually playing through a reverb

384
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:53,010
filter and this this filter has a an

385
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,970
attribute called mix and I I'm going to

386
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,720
try and attach something to it and I

387
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:12,540
hope this works

388
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,330
so this is a leap motion and there's

389
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,100
this javascript library that allows you

390
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,650
to do leap motion stuff in the browser

391
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,530
and I've just attached it so this this

392
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,210
method looks quite complicated but

393
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,890
that's just because I have to kind of

394
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,440
reverse the object graph of this frame

395
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,290
that comes from the sensor and I need to

396
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,210
do it in a way that doesn't crash if the

397
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,940
object is actually not there so that's

398
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:48,710
the best thing I came up with now let's

399
00:26:48,710 --> 00:29:41,280
turn it into music

400
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:57,100
thank you very much
