00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:13,879

you

2
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,800
alright so as waging said I'm Jennifer

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Wong and I'm here to talk about

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,750
designing responsive emails and coding

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,169
in the year 2000 and you all are welcome

6
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:30,310
to follow along by going to this github

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:37,870
link here and to start so Who am I I am

8
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,680
a software engineer at eventbrite and

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,390
before that I actually worked as a civil

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,760
engineer just like these two ladies here

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,879
I quickly became bored with the very

12
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,039
slow pace of the projects at that time

13
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,020
you know things when you're making

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,020
buildings it takes years to complete so

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,190
I wanted to be in a more innovative

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,320
space and I decided that that would be

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,800
tech so to get my foot in the door I

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,700
started doing I started working as a

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,520
community specialist for a startup and

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,560
that meant that I was actually just

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,869
doing customer support for a company

22
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:16,440
that was around for about 10 years I

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,119
totally totally hated it and so I

24
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,270
decided to teach myself to code I would

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,060
work on my projects at nights I would go

26
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,729
to hack my hackathons and I just kept

27
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:29,830
working on these things and eventually

28
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,160
that led to success and I landed my

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,739
first job as a front-end developer at a

30
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:42,610
company called hot pads yay so here we

31
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,160
go my first assignment at hot pads was

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,250
to redesign all of our emails and make

33
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,020
them responsive and I was like oh yeah

34
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,739
no problem super easy right I started

35
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,629
working them on those emails and I

36
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:58,300
thought oh crap I have no idea what I'm

37
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,410
doing but fortunately i'm here to share

38
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,810
all of my strategies and mistakes with

39
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,890
you all so my story is about how emails

40
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,260
are evil which I'm sure many of you can

41
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,580
relate to if you've ever worked on

42
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,709
responsive emails so I'll talk a bit

43
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,300
about design

44
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,070
food and I'll share some resources that

45
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,870
i found along the way so to start I'm

46
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,840
going to talk about design so first

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
things first when I was working on

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,800
hotpads they asked me to redesign their

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,180
welcome email and i decided to first

50
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,770
start by doing a bunch of research so i

51
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,750
signed up for a ton of different

52
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,460
services just so i could look at their

53
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,360
welcome emails I thought the prettiest

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,250
email that i found was actually in d

55
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,080
gogos which we can take a look at here

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,680
very quickly oh there we go so the first

57
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,300
thing I notice about this email is they

58
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,280
have this top anchored logo so you know

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,170
exactly where the emails coming from and

60
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,810
as they move down the page I see a lot

61
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,790
of really beautiful image content and

62
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,100
notice that all their calls to action

63
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,470
are the same color so I can just click

64
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,590
on these buttons on these pink links and

65
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,330
also i can click on the images which is

66
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,340
great so keep scrolling down and then I

67
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,870
also notice that there they have these

68
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,120
social media buttons but also they have

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,830
links in text and that's really great

70
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,290
for accessibility and then I also see of

71
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,900
course a way to unsubscribe and update

72
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,510
your subscription so some of the

73
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,250
takeaways that I found in doing all the

74
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,380
research and again I received many many

75
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,900
welcome emails was that most of them

76
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,180
were very text light many of them were

77
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,540
very image heavy there was always a logo

78
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,720
there at the very top of the email and

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,160
also max-width so you didn't have your

80
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,840
users reading across the page a quick

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,180
disclaimer about all those things so

82
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,040
they may not work for everybody and I

83
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,360
highly recommend if you're working on

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,370
emails is to a/b tests all of your

85
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,989
emails so after doing that research I

86
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,269
decided to check out what our welcome

87
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,079
email looked like get ready

88
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,419
this is what it looked like the first

89
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:21,159
thing I notice I'm like why is our logo

90
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,259
kind of right in the middle of our email

91
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,699
what's with all that weird spacing and

92
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,699
why is there text after our closing for

93
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,439
like welcome on board but then we add on

94
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,150
a bunch of stuff at the end and then

95
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,169
there's also no way to unsubscribe so

96
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,150
seeing that email I felt very much like

97
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,729
Doge was like wow just wow all right so

98
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:48,310
next up I decided to plan and I was like

99
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,469
what am I making what am i doing for hot

100
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:54,009
pads so I had a couple of goals and

101
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,719
those two things were to bring

102
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:58,419
consistency to our emails our emails

103
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,830
were just all over the place they all

104
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,650
look different they all looked crazy so

105
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,569
I wanted to really give them a more

106
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:07,300
formalized template and I thought that

107
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,650
that would bring a lot of brand

108
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,509
awareness because once you see that

109
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:12,940
recognizable template you know where

110
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,529
your emails are coming from so to make

111
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:20,740
or not to make I decided or I checked

112
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,840
out the internet and saw that there are

113
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,639
a ton of pre-made email templates that

114
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,889
you can use so you don't actually have

115
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,840
to build them from scratch and they can

116
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,539
be quite helpful but I actually didn't

117
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,250
use them personally and there are a few

118
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,279
reasons for that those reasons being

119
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,830
that it was my first project as a

120
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,360
front-end developer and I really wanted

121
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,000
to get you know in the nitty-gritty of

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,310
the code and so I actually built up our

123
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,129
template from scratch if you guys have

124
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,569
less time to work on your emails

125
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:51,490
pre-made templates can be a really great

126
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,529
way to go on when designing emails it

127
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:58,659
can be really great to sketch so here

128
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,250
you can see I've sketched the same email

129
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,379
four different times and that just gives

130
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,940
you a sense of where you want to lay

131
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,469
things out and that can really help

132
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,870
before your coding especially if you

133
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,319
don't have a designer Photoshop can be

134
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,719
really great if you have the skills I

135
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:17,790
definitely say go for it

136
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,569
another thing I wanted to think about

137
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:22,419
when I was planning was what I call our

138
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,460
role of thumbs or the minimum touchable

139
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,729
area on mobile devices so I had often

140
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:32,500
heard of the number 44 x 44 pixels it

141
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,629
turns out that number is wrong it comes

142
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,539
from the original iphone human interface

143
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,240
guidelines for the very first iphone and

144
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,530
those guidelines don't even exist

145
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,389
anymore so just so you know actually all

146
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,009
mobile devices have a different minimum

147
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,780
touchable area so i've linked to these

148
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,120
two pages here and they definitely help

149
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,060
you figure out what that size is and

150
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,490
it's really dependent on what devices

151
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,860
are most popular with your users so here

152
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,690
is the new template for our welcome

153
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,639
email that I created I like to say it's

154
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,330
a design for the new millennium in the

155
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,710
year 2000 so the design I can see is

156
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,449
like a little bit outdated but this is

157
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:20,830
actually what our website looks like

158
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,680
back then and so I was obviously pulling

159
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,060
some design cues from our website and

160
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,770
just for comparison this is what our old

161
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:36,050
emails look like and versus the new one

162
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,310
all right on to some code so here's a

163
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,810
bunch of tips and tricks that I learned

164
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,710
along the way so some things that I

165
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,449
learned before I started coding our

166
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:53,629
emails number one tables are coming

167
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,830
mozilla developers network says note

168
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,520
prior to the creation of CSS HTML table

169
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,469
elements were often used as a message

170
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,650
for page layout this usage has been

171
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,560
discouraged since HTML 4 and the table

172
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,810
element should not be used for layout

173
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:18,160
purposes email say Lowell

174
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,730
tables are really important in emails if

175
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,980
you don't have a rapper table in your

176
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,930
email it actually makes all of your code

177
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,170
disappear in Apple Mail and outlook 2011

178
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,469
so make sure you have that outer table

179
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,830
something I also found out was that

180
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,950
tables don't display as inline or block

181
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,890
or inline block and I was like what what

182
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,960
does that mean well table is actually

183
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,230
default to display as table but in that

184
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,360
case chrome actually will ignore a max

185
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,520
wits that you said on your emails so you

186
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,080
definitely want to set your table to

187
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,810
display as block next up is inline

188
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,230
styles you definitely need them reason

189
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,270
being gmail doesn't support of style on

190
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,850
the head outlook.com doesn't support a

191
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,130
link element in the head and many

192
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,650
clients don't support a whole like bevy

193
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,070
and slew of CSS so a really great page

194
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,760
to help you know what is supported is

195
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,700
campaign monitor CSS page here what you

196
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,460
see here is a really great chart which

197
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,380
shows all of these different email

198
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,080
clients and what's supported what CSS is

199
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,530
supported in them so unfortunately

200
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,730
you're going to be doing a whole lot of

201
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,490
this if you're designing emails it's

202
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,850
really ugly I know but it's got to

203
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,830
happen all right again back to max width

204
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,560
so I think that this company didn't get

205
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
the memo on max width and you see that

206
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,730
their text just kind of goes all the way

207
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,260
across the screen and it just makes it

208
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,650
really hard to read so it's important to

209
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,410
set a max width on your email and

210
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,020
typically it's between 550 to 600 pixels

211
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,010
and that's based on most email clients

212
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,010
preview pains a quick note about

213
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,140
comments when you're writing emails

214
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,610
you're going to have tables within

215
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,550
tables within tables and so you're going

216
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,690
to have tables all the way down your

217
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,670
page and it's really important to have

218
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,040
comments so you know where you are so if

219
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,690
you go back and look at this code really

220
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,610
quickly you'll see that it's great and

221
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,620
super helpful to have comments letting

222
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,590
you know where each table begins and

223
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,760
all right image alternatives it's always

224
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,790
great to have an alt tag or a background

225
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,089
color on your images a lot of browsers

226
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,700
and clients don't automatically display

227
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,769
images and so when that happens it's

228
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,690
good to have a back up there and this is

229
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,640
also great for accessibility so you

230
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,940
should be doing it on the web as well so

231
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,260
this is an example of an email in Gmail

232
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,089
our logo didn't show up and so it's

233
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,890
great to have that alts there so that

234
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,769
your users know what image is being

235
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,279
loaded another thing I did is in our

236
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,930
footer we had that really beautiful like

237
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,540
image at the very bottom but I set a

238
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,430
background color on that so that the

239
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,500
border goes all the way around in case

240
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,600
that images and showing and I created a

241
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,779
template you can check it out on github

242
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,640
why should you template well it's really

243
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,620
great to not have to repeat yourself so

244
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,810
here you see two different emails but

245
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,709
all those little micro listings you'll

246
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:35,170
see they overlap between both and so

247
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,240
those are just kind of little pieces of

248
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,100
abstracted code that I don't have to

249
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,170
keep riding over and over again so it's

250
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,820
really helpful to have a template all

251
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,260
right some things I learned while I was

252
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,339
coding my emails media queries I'm sure

253
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:52,720
you guys are all really familiar with

254
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
those they can be super helpful for

255
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,610
readability and also targeting specific

256
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,670
devices a quick note is that there are a

257
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,290
lot of clients that don't support media

258
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,209
queries so you'll definitely want to pay

259
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:06,130
attention to those and style campaign

260
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,120
did a really great or did some really

261
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,329
great research on this and so they tell

262
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:16,149
you which devices and which email

263
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:17,860
clients will support media queries or

264
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,120
not and with media queries you

265
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,949
definitely want to cover your bases so

266
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:25,089
it's really good to use them in

267
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,579
conjunction with fluid layouts so here

268
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,839
I've paired a media query targeting

269
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,760
devices that are smaller with the

270
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,910
percentage based width here and that

271
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,500
will help you cover all the clients that

272
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,320
do and don't support media queries next

273
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,870
up is device pixel ratio so the device

274
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,089
pixel ratio is the ratio between logical

275
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,029
pixels and physical pixels and that will

276
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:53,920
help you target retina or high res

277
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,670
devices and I'll actually come to a

278
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,260
really great example of that in just a

279
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,100
bit all right important when should you

280
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,970
use it a lot of people say never but in

281
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,860
emails it can be necessary sometimes in

282
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,930
emails your inline styles will overwrite

283
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,240
media queries so here's a really good

284
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,160
example of when you actually want to use

285
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,550
important so in line I have the height

286
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,470
and the line height of an element set to

287
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,990
10 pixels but on actually smaller

288
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,850
devices what I want is to have a height

289
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,829
and the line height be 5 pixels and so I

290
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:31,810
have to set an important on there when

291
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:38,140
being used with a media query all right

292
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,940
something weird I learned along the way

293
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,550
to is about line height if you look at

294
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,199
the very bottom of this image you'll see

295
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,870
this like thin blue line right at the

296
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,899
bottom and I'm like what is that oh why

297
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,420
is that there it's so annoying it turns

298
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,459
out that the solution to this is to set

299
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,620
a line height on the surrounding column

300
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,810
element of your image and that just

301
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,240
brings it down all right some things I

302
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
learned after the release of my emails

303
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,399
oops this one is really weird when you

304
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,390
have an image tag in an anchor tag

305
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,520
something strange happens sometimes in a

306
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,649
client you'll see that there's this

307
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:22,480
weird gray border around your image and

308
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,699
it's so it happens so occasionally and

309
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:26,230
so strangely that I don't even have an

310
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,550
example of it unfortunately it turns out

311
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,260
the reason for this is actually the

312
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,779
white space in your HTML and so you can

313
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:37,360
actually just move the image tag to be

314
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,339
in the same line as your anchor tag or

315
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:41,470
you can comment out the white space and

316
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,850
that removed that weird gray border

317
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,390
hi-res images for retina

318
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,820
so this email actually went out to a

319
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,740
bunch of our users and they're like what

320
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,910
oh my god caution has like oh crap I'm

321
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,630
sorry so what was the problem here the

322
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,030
problem was I was using a very large

323
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,970
image and then sizing it down for retina

324
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,950
devices but outlook 2007 2010-2013 and

325
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,110
outlook and Internet Explorer don't

326
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,490
allow for HTML or css image resizing the

327
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,740
solution is to set a background image

328
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,200
your retina image on the surrounding

329
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,720
column element and then set the inner

330
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,020
image to display as none and i found

331
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,810
that solution on campaign monitor so

332
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,460
here you'll see that's exactly what i've

333
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,420
done so i set a background image on our

334
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,260
column element and then the image inside

335
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,090
the column element i set to display as

336
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,970
none so that's how you can use retina

337
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,600
images in your emails um another thing

338
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,340
is that outlook 2007 2010 and 2013 don't

339
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,180
support max width so what you'll want to

340
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,330
do here is use a max with bypass what

341
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,820
you do is you set a fluid layout as your

342
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,190
baseline so you set that to be your

343
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,100
woods one hundred percent so that all

344
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,690
use cases use that one hundred percent

345
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,510
but for larger screens then you'll set

346
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,270
the width to be affixed with instead of

347
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,610
using max width so you may be wondering

348
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:27,040
outlook 2007 2010 in 2013 WTF well the

349
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,920
reason for their issues is the rendering

350
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,820
engines outlook 2002 2003 use Internet

351
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,150
Explorer to render their emails outlook

352
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,960
2007 10 and 13 used Microsoft Word as

353
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,240
their rendering engines and I'm sure you

354
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,010
guys can understand what problems that

355
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,580
would cause outlook 2011 also called

356
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,620
outlook for mac actually uses webkit to

357
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,720
render their emails and I was like why

358
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,850
did you guys switch back to Microsoft

359
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,720
Word in 2013 I don't know but that's

360
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,830
something to keep in mind

361
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,850
again gmail doesn't support styles in

362
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,760
the head so if you want to change the

363
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,920
color of your links you actually have to

364
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,620
go and style every single anchor tag in

365
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,260
line of your email so definitely think

366
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,089
twice before you decide to change that

367
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:23,959
color AOL and outlook.com they do these

368
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,300
this really weird thing well the they'll

369
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,150
prefix all of your styles and your

370
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,060
classes with either external class or

371
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,320
ale AOL replaced body a solution to that

372
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,060
for at least outlook calm is you can

373
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,590
actually prefix all your classes

374
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,210
yourself which is great you can just

375
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,850
target them right away but AOL you can't

376
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,470
do that because it'll double up the

377
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,210
class and that'll target nothing so I

378
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,590
found out that actually a well does

379
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,010
support Unicode classes though but not

380
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,500
Unicode IDs and so that's a really great

381
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,800
way to target AOL styles and that's

382
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,060
something that I learned from mr. mark

383
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:07,370
Robbins unfortunately android mail and

384
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,670
outlook.com in internet explorer also

385
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,420
support the Unicode class but not the

386
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,890
Unicode ID so targeting AOL it

387
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,750
specifically is probably not possible at

388
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,670
least in what I found but if anybody

389
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,620
else knows of anything definitely let me

390
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,950
know Yahoo argh they really like to

391
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,810
strip out a bunch of things so they'll

392
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,880
strip out your overflow X property

393
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,650
they'll strip out any importance that

394
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,740
you have and strangely they'll strip out

395
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,370
a display none in line but not in your

396
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:49,820
style block something to keep in mind at

397
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,330
WebKit WebKit and opera do not mask on

398
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,240
your border radius so you see here in

399
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,330
this image on the left you can see that

400
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,370
that little border radius in grey

401
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,330
there's a little its kind of blocked

402
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,770
there's like a little corner missing

403
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,600
there I can't see my borderie yes and

404
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,880
then what I wanted it to show up like is

405
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,380
on

406
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,630
right I wanted to see that border-radius

407
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:18,940
there so what you can do to solve that

408
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,440
issue if you guys are received at your

409
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,950
border radius is missing is that you can

410
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,700
add an intermediate div that doesn't

411
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,890
have the CSS positioning on your board

412
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,100
or a radius Oh or the overflow hidden so

413
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,860
that's this is what that looks like so

414
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,200
the parent element is positioned the

415
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,660
intermediate element has the border

416
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,310
radius and the overflow hidden and

417
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,470
that's the one that's not positioned and

418
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,360
that's what will allow your border

419
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:53,140
radius to appear alright shhh ain't

420
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,430
changes so android gmail allows you to

421
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,570
use forms prior to version 5.0 but

422
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,490
android gmail disabled that after

423
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,240
android or after version 5.0 however

424
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,630
android email does support forums so

425
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,700
basically you just have to keep rolling

426
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,070
with the times we really wanted to use

427
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,630
forums and you just have to keep doing

428
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,600
research on what you can do to make that

429
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
happen so you have to stay up to date

430
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,520
and you can stay up to date by checking

431
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,380
out a bunch of these resources that I

432
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,830
found first up there's a bunch of blogs

433
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,370
here style campaign is a great service

434
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,920
that is run by a woman named Anna Yeaman

435
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,080
she's a creative director there and she

436
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,360
has a bunch of really amazing solutions

437
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,880
she has this crazy device lab you can

438
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,860
kind of see it in the background here

439
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,960
and she has tons of devices that she's

440
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,560
constantly testing on litmus is a really

441
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,980
great email testing suite and they allow

442
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,110
you to test your emails across many

443
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,440
different clients campaign monitor and

444
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,240
MailChimp are both online marketing

445
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,490
email solutions and they allow you to

446
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,010
send emails check out analytics and test

447
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,560
your emails use different templates so

448
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,240
these are all really amazing blogs

449
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,920
they're just working with emails all day

450
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,110
and I found a lot of great information

451
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:20,170
on those templates so earlier I

452
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,520
mentioned that there are a bunch of

453
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,850
pre-made templates that you can use

454
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,950
and so here are a bunch of them in the

455
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,470
background you'll actually see the HTML

456
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,380
email boilerplate it's a lot of code

457
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,320
it's really crazy but of course it's

458
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,450
going to most likely really hit all

459
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,820
those email clients that you may need to

460
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,340
support so go ahead and check those out

461
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:49,440
and lastly for resources oops come on

462
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,100
keyboard testing testing your emails is

463
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,630
super important people are reading

464
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,730
emails on all types of devices in all

465
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,890
types of clients all the time so a bunch

466
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,770
of resources here but litmus email and

467
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,350
acid and targeted i/o are really great

468
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,590
solutions they they support a ton of

469
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,620
different clients and puts mail actually

470
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,809
is a free service and that can be really

471
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,980
helpful as well and that's all i have

472
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,840
for you if you have questions feel free

473
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:26,570
to find me after the talk there are some

474
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,260
pseudo cast in CSS by however oh haha

475
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,980
are they working on the those kinds so

476
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,720
you can actually check out that campaign

477
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,630
monitor CSS page and it'll tell you

478
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,370
there are some pseudo classes that are

479
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,350
supported and some that are not and it

480
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:48,030
really depends on the client how do you

481
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,870
deal with the consistency of once on of

482
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,090
course i'll email clients that are

483
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,049
concerned i do america I it email HTML

484
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:00,990
email as well and my main problem is the

485
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:06,210
font I think custom fonts are not

486
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,970
supported on me aside how do you make

487
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,730
the funds consistent on all the

488
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,289
immigrants use a standard font I think

489
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:17,789
that's probably your best solution

490
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:20,700
unfortunately is to really have just the

491
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,309
standard fonts or if you want to use a

492
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,140
custom font to use it just on the

493
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,909
clients that support it and definitely

494
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:28,750
have like a very

495
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,650
you know sturdy fall back in that case

496
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,240
if there any way to bypass the image

497
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,060
display permissions in outlook like when

498
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,130
you first open the mail and outlook you

499
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,950
have to like click right click and give

500
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,300
the permission or display is there any

501
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,280
way to bypass that I don't think there's

502
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,620
a way to do that unfortunately it has to
