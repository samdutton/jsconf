1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540

designer who am I my name is Carlos

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,430
Perez I am the director of design at bat

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,330
hound I am a designer but i also like to

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,150
build a lot with the web and i made my

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,849
first website in 1995 and i use tables

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,400
to do the layout and i use a phone line

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,130
to transmit the data so dating myself a

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,350
little bit but yeah I've been at this

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,460
for a while so I design I code I use vim

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,380
and I lie I love working with developers

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,460
I don't just like working with

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,170
developers I know sometimes that's an

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,570
odd sentiment from designers I wish it

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,590
wasn't but sometimes it is you can

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,230
follow myself forbid hound where who I

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,840
work with at carlos perez r at bid hound

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,640
io on Twitter and yeah it how it is

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,320
sponsoring this which is awesome I'm

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,149
happy to be here this is my first time I

20
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:52,230
guess it'll be my last time

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,110
unfortunately but really excited to be

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,000
here so what am I talking about when my

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,399
boss Dan came to me he said we want you

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,290
to do the talk at JS comp for us this

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,210
year and I said okay that's that's a

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,830
little it's intimidating it's a bit

27
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,520
awkward because what do I have to

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,380
contribute to a room of developers and I

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,580
kind of figured you know what actually I

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,380
have a lot to contribute we work

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,950
together a lot we can work together even

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,159
better a lot of the times so I really

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,049
did see this as an opportunity it took

34
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,090
me exactly one week to do to get to that

35
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,920
point but I figured yeah let's go for it

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,930
so what I'm going to run through is kind

37
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,450
of a little bit as you're going to share

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,189
a bit of the process that we have a bit

39
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,290
hound and how we mesh design a

40
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,689
development together I wouldn't say it's

41
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,509
necessarily unique but it feels good so

42
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm kind of excited to be able to share

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,340
that any time I have the opportunity to

44
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,509
so I'm going to talk about where design

45
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,210
goes kind of seems like a silly question

46
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,860
but it's it's one I think a lot of

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,259
people struggle with what's our process

48
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,630
how do we accomplish these things what

49
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,990
tools we use to improve collaboration is

50
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,670
there too much about good things

51
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,550
sometimes and I'll share some some

52
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,430
downfalls why javascript is the best to

53
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,560
help bridge design and development

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,819
and why this all matters so just to

55
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,560
preface this this isn't the agile

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,540
manifesto I this is just my opinion and

57
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,340
we we pride ourselves in changing our

58
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,310
process a lot if you know we might have

59
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,959
a few sprint plantings we're just like

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,130
you know what this isn't working anymore

61
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,370
and we things up so this is kind of like

62
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,739
the culmination of of what we've

63
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,200
experienced over the past couple years

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,430
some of my experiences working at other

65
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,850
organizations so again just my opinion

66
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,470
so to answer that first question where

67
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,720
does design go it's a tough question

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,880
product managers designers developers we

69
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,120
all struggle with it where does it go a

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,160
lot of deb shops you now use agile of

71
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,470
course and it's usually a developer

72
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,099
introduced process and it usually winds

73
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,470
up living in development so as an

74
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,120
outsider the designer coming in it's

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,099
kind of hard to find that sweet spot of

76
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,239
like so where do I fit in on this so I'm

77
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,890
going to hopefully answer that a little

78
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,579
bit better we know it shouldn't go at

79
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,590
the end I think we've been beaten the

80
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,390
over the head with that enough where if

81
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,040
you're leading designed to be that

82
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,900
little like little bit of lipstick at

83
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,430
the end a little bit of Polish that you

84
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,410
want to pretty things up ah it doesn't

85
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,989
really work so I'm not going to dwell on

86
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,920
that too much so that can only say the

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,900
beginning right and it feels good I'm

88
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,220
going to start off with design we're

89
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,180
doing you're right we're thinking about

90
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,609
the problem first we're going to do the

91
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:45,750
mock-ups and then we're going to hand it

92
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,480
off and we're going to build it but this

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,160
is actually kind of where I see the

94
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,170
process fell apart a lot because the

95
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,540
expectation generally is designer and

96
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,880
the product manager go off look at the

97
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,530
research do interviews with users do

98
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,799
some wire frames makeup to mock ups then

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,239
that got to hand it off the developers

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,889
create some stories get those assigned

101
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:10,170
and it gets built and it's usually about

102
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,600
this time when the designer stops that

103
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,069
on that feature and goes works on the

104
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,010
next one something that I had struggled

105
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,049
with a lot was the idea of having to

106
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:21,169
keep one sprint ahead of the developers

107
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,490
and that was really really challenging a

108
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,370
because it expected that that work could

109
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,180
be done

110
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,639
you know in a sprint right ahead but

111
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,570
then it didn't really give that

112
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,060
opportunity to continue working on that

113
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,139
initial feature so yeah so what's what's

114
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,400
the problem with I won't i kind of just

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,120
explained that sorry but the i think

116
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,710
that what what generally happens with

117
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,900
this is the designers original intent

118
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,389
might not carry through to the end

119
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,060
product and that's not the developers

120
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,090
fault at all everything is done with a

121
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,970
series of best guesses right designers

122
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,410
will do mock-ups based on the

123
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,389
information they have at the time to

124
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:01,530
give it to the developers developers

125
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,000
have different information they have

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,190
technical reasons why something can or

127
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,680
can't happen they run into other Road

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,120
bloxorz other bugs there's other

129
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,620
priorities that come up so to make the

130
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,060
assumption that we can figure out the

131
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,280
design at the beginning and then it gets

132
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,530
just you know the perfect product comes

133
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,449
out at the end well it's it's a

134
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,270
challenging one so all right where does

135
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,419
it go might not like where this is

136
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,389
leading but it's kind of everywhere and

137
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,620
that's easy for me to say and the

138
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,270
designers standing up here saying design

139
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,580
should be everywhere well development

140
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,650
should be everywhere too I think it's

141
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,900
really a product building Express it's

142
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,550
not a dev process it's not a design

143
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,159
process so I've been home we really try

144
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,400
to make this about the product

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,060
development starts at the beginning

146
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,250
design starts at the beginning and we

147
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,520
work our way through it so let me

148
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,260
explain how we actually go about doing

149
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,630
this so how do we put design everywhere

150
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,020
for starters we assign our features to a

151
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,740
designer and developer pair board our

152
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,870
CTO just pointed out to me it's like

153
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,190
yeah we actually have two designers and

154
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,650
one developer we're not counting you of

155
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,860
course we have another one so but that's

156
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,090
that's actually kind of an interesting

157
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,520
thing and we're building a tool that

158
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,159
looks at your code it's kind of neat

159
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,539
though so we we assign the feature and

160
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,460
the expectation is we don't really go

161
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,530
dive deep into what that feature is

162
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,300
supposed to do at the time we let the

163
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,330
pair figure that out and that what that

164
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,370
kind of means is just from the get-go

165
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,409
there aren't necessarily too many

166
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:38,740
assumptions about what it

167
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,580
look like we start by looking at the

168
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,800
data so a lot of our features will

169
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,930
actually start with a route that outputs

170
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,569
JSON or you know not even maybe it's

171
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,970
just something we we throw in slack and

172
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,669
that's where we start discussing it and

173
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:56,910
what this does is gets rid of that

174
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,699
paradigm of the designer using perfect

175
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,860
data to do these perfect mock-ups and

176
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,020
everything looks beautiful but once you

177
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,759
start plugging in real data you realize

178
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,400
that falls apart really quickly so we

179
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,530
start with the data so that anything

180
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,419
that we do from a design perspective is

181
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:15,569
already looking at real world

182
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,370
circumstances and that really that

183
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,880
really helps out a lot we don't define a

184
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,069
handoff stage where you know once

185
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,050
designs done developers take over of

186
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,319
course it happens but it's never it's

187
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,479
never the same for for any given feature

188
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:36,610
so and like I said there there would the

189
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,680
handoff might actually happen multiple

190
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,560
times designed to Deb back the design

191
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,030
and it's a iterative process another

192
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,969
little trick up our sleeves is we we

193
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,750
like designers who code so where we code

194
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,330
enough to be dangerous so you can really

195
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,400
probably call us front-end developers

196
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,960
that's probably what we would be called

197
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,940
in a lot of organizations but we

198
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,699
definitely lean towards the aesthetic

199
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,639
the experience side so weird that first

200
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,020
run at second but given how closely we

201
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,940
work with our developers that's a very

202
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,960
nice compliment what this also helps

203
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,729
with which you might appreciate is those

204
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:23,110
pixel perfect mind-numbing alterations

205
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,789
that the designer wants to do well we do

206
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:27,580
that ourselves so hopefully that leaves

207
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,219
the the more interesting and more

208
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:34,029
complicated dev work available so you're

209
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:35,909
not getting annoyed by us all the time

210
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,070
so developers help with design problems

211
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,550
that's that's how we do it designers

212
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,520
help with Deb problems and we we do do a

213
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,110
lot of pair programming but it's often

214
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,060
with the designer and the developer

215
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,980
which is really neat and we both learn

216
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,180
so much

217
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,180
from that process oh so that's top tools

218
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,730
and i don't mean the designers i mean

219
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,610
like apps and stuff the ones that we use

220
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,760
to help us do this process better so to

221
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,770
start i want to say break down the

222
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,899
barriers of these are design tools and

223
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,790
these are developer tools because that

224
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,520
already been just silos the the process

225
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,930
like well i'm not supposed to use that

226
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,830
so i'm not going to bother learning

227
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,370
about it so we we try to find as many

228
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,709
many ways to level that playing field we

229
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,380
we use pull requests kind of like how

230
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,510
github I don't know if they still do but

231
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,100
this is what they used to do there's

232
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,290
presentation called how github uses

233
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,410
github to build github and we kind of

234
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,029
modeled our process around that and that

235
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,860
is you open a PO request the moment you

236
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,020
start on a future versus it's just the

237
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,339
thing that you do at the end to review

238
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:48,300
the code and what that lets us do is is

239
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,380
embed discussion into the pull request

240
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,990
we have this thread of comments we put

241
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,880
mock-ups in there we put all sorts of

242
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,440
things we use it to review code of

243
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,200
course and it gives us kind of a

244
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,510
historical backlog of how a feature got

245
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,120
developed and we tend to work very

246
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,310
closely in office together but whenever

247
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,830
travel does happen this is a perfect way

248
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,200
for us to stay on top of things but the

249
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,820
fact that design is in those pull

250
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,220
requests from the beginning also means

251
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,020
that towards the end of the review

252
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,029
process design is also involved and they

253
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,650
know everybody is on the same page about

254
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:26,670
what's going on your issue tracker I

255
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,990
included this because I i went to a

256
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,110
design meetup months ago and I asked to

257
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,540
designers about what issue tracker they

258
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,760
use that at their companies and they

259
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,410
kind of just grumbled and said oh I

260
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,690
don't know the developers use pivotal we

261
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,240
don't usually touch that which I kind of

262
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,920
found found interesting is like why not

263
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,660
that's perfect way for you guys to

264
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,880
collaborate with development put new

265
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,630
ideas down initiate discussion so I

266
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,970
actually see the issue tracker is just

267
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,350
as much as design tool as a development

268
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,870
and it's great for great for that

269
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,760
conversation so for designers who are

270
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,110
just dangerous enough with

271
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,950
ode get is a very daunting roadblock a

272
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,420
involves the command line so it's

273
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,990
already you kind of lost most designers

274
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:21,250
and so once you're you know you want to

275
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,810
play around with code but then get kind

276
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,290
of gets in the way so you must have I'm

277
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,420
sure there's a onboarding process to

278
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,970
share your your best practices with new

279
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,399
hires when it comes to your get process

280
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,980
and i encourage you to include designers

281
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,890
in that as well there's a there's a GUI

282
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,720
app called tower for the mac that is

283
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,180
brilliant for this that's how i got to

284
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,430
understand get i now use it on the

285
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,839
command line but i still use tower for

286
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,980
certain things because just does it

287
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,209
better Oh at least I feel it does better

288
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,120
so get them comfortable and get your

289
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,980
local dev environment should be friendly

290
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,290
and this is obviously could be said for

291
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,829
both designers and developers the moment

292
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:05,320
again any barrier that might prevent

293
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,880
somebody from pittle fiddling around

294
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,829
with with code from prototyping

295
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,500
something it's just an excuse to say you

296
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,480
know what hey not really my job I guess

297
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,579
I'm going to stick to doing some

298
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:18,940
mock-ups and sketch or Photoshop so a

299
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,000
bit helm i love i love our local dev

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,399
environment it takes those commands to

301
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,000
get running board did a talk about how

302
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,899
we how we get from zero deploy request

303
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,000
and by noon or buy lunch something like

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,899
that and it's totally doable so the the

305
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,000
easier it is to get up and running the

306
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,560
less of a barrier of course it is to

307
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,610
start fiddling with some code this this

308
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,430
kind of seems like a like a simple idea

309
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,350
use old-school tools and but it's

310
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,670
actually quite powerful when you think

311
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,250
about use a chalkboard or you use a

312
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,730
whiteboard or paper whatever and there's

313
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,920
no pretenses behind well that's a design

314
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,529
tool or that's a developer tool no it's

315
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:07,480
it's just that it's a thing it's a tool

316
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,060
and we use them extensively we use them

317
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,970
for our sprint planning we you we do our

318
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,190
to-do lists on there we do our mock-ups

319
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,529
on there and it's very common to see

320
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:18,290
will

321
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,820
have a design element mocked up and

322
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,380
right next to it the data structure of

323
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,910
the data that's going to populate those

324
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,250
elements so that discussion happens from

325
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,630
the get-go javascript is the best I

326
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,399
don't have to tell you this you're here

327
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,709
for a reason but i'll give you the

328
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,500
designers perspective of why javascript

329
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,310
is awesome for this this includes jquery

330
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,930
and I know I've and I've heard it

331
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,089
firsthand where it's like we want

332
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,060
developers who do javascript and no not

333
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,040
jquery and it's like well hold on a

334
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,360
minute jquery is I think the best

335
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,139
language to orb language sorry framework

336
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:00,230
that bridges what's happening in the

337
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,120
browser to code and it's something as

338
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,100
designers it's really easy to understand

339
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,199
and I've tried PHP I looked at

340
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:09,199
objective-c million zillion times and

341
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,949
gave up on that those never took jquery

342
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:16,550
it was very easy to grasp very easy to

343
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,190
start prototyping in it which brings me

344
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,350
to prototyping I mean that's great again

345
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,290
you know this designers might not open

346
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,660
up the Dom inspector I mean I've I know

347
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,579
how many times I've done this too it

348
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:30,680
doesn't look as designer and said like

349
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,769
even if you just wanted to change text

350
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,060
you can do it like this and then their

351
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,639
eyes just light up and never mind the

352
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,350
things you can actually do with with

353
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,209
actual animation and they're all that

354
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:43,399
kind of stuff so javascript is it's

355
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,220
perfect for prototyping a lot of our

356
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,470
features start as hockey prototypes like

357
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,399
this and they that's they get cleaned up

358
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,430
but that's eventually what gets chipped

359
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,310
and it's even better when you're using

360
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,120
nodes so for my personal experience I

361
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,880
knew a little bit of jQuery I got better

362
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,790
at just vanilla JavaScript and then I

363
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,370
started to understand the backend a lot

364
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,769
better it's one language I got it and

365
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,970
again that's just a powerful thing to

366
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,380
arm somebody with when when it usually

367
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,579
it's just a very daunting task so can

368
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,050
you have too much of a good thing is

369
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,600
there too much crossover that happens

370
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,379
between design of development and there

371
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:34,049
it's absolutely there is something that

372
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:37,829
the designers that at Midtown often

373
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:39,720
struggle with is getting caught up in

374
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,069
the challenge of trying to figure

375
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:44,220
something out so after about the sixth

376
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,499
hour trying to scour stackoverflow for

377
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:49,319
an answer I asked a developer and I get

378
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:52,109
it solved in five minutes so it's

379
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,759
something we just have to kind of keep

380
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,099
on top up and say this is this is great

381
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:57,659
we're all about the pursuit of knowledge

382
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:00,389
and and learning about this but at the

383
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:01,829
end of the day we got to ship something

384
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,439
so it's just something to be cognizant

385
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:08,249
of we also find developers using doing

386
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:11,669
too much design actually we don't it's

387
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:16,499
it's I didn't have a screenshot of the

388
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,749
table thing that you did other day but

389
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:22,289
and this isn't a slight honestly what

390
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,599
what is what is awesome and I never get

391
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:27,539
tired of is when when we're talking

392
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,189
about features or we talk about planning

393
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,759
and the developers are saying hold on a

394
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,399
minute we can't do it like this that

395
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,049
would be a bad experience that wouldn't

396
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:39,029
look right it wouldn't fit well with the

397
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:41,369
product and that that happens a lot

398
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:45,989
which is really really awesome the

399
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:48,299
biggest concern is when is a feature

400
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,639
done so you're working with design

401
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,379
development very much entrenched and you

402
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,329
start getting those problems and you're

403
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:59,369
starting to any and you need to solve

404
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:02,579
them and that couldn't spiral sometimes

405
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:07,679
out of control but at the same time it's

406
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,870
kind of a good thing so I mean we call

407
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,269
the scope creep right but the scope is

408
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,990
rarely right so when it one's a better

409
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,579
time to do it well right in the middle

410
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,409
of it when you're when you're building

411
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:24,299
the product so it is good but of course

412
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,829
at the end of the day you need to you

413
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,559
need to ship something so we still need

414
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,240
we still struggle with it and we just

415
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,490
need to plan a bit better at ahead to

416
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,779
know you know what this looks like one

417
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,700
of those features that just it's going

418
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,059
to grow will will often ship things into

419
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,830
production behind a feature flag will

420
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,310
play around with it for a while

421
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,850
or we before we expose it to the to the

422
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,390
rest of our users and sometimes

423
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,920
sometimes this happens and maybe on more

424
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,820
than one occasion but I don't really

425
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,640
want to dwell on that yeah I've ruined a

426
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,670
good couple morning by force pushing to

427
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,120
master I really like the new protected

428
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,110
branch feature on github and I do have

429
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,530
some pre push or commit tools a command

430
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,220
line to prevent that but that's good I

431
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,230
hopefully will never hopefully will

432
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:29,030
never make that mistake again so so what

433
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,240
why why does this matter why why should

434
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,910
you try to get designers developers

435
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,690
working together and honestly think it

436
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,150
makes for more thoughtful products you

437
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,700
start you start thinking everybody

438
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,140
starts thinking about the experience

439
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,180
about the user you're all working

440
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,100
towards the same goal it and it

441
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,780
translates to to your users kind of like

442
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,660
a mentioned before there's a constant

443
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,210
level of Polish going on because both

444
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,740
designers and developers are all of a

445
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,690
sudden comfortable to fix those little

446
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,830
nitpicky things that are in production

447
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,770
that never quite get assigned in it in a

448
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,140
sprint because yeah they're never top of

449
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,260
mind right everybody's armed with the

450
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,690
right tool set to make the changes

451
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,150
themselves so we will often just fix it

452
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,860
rather than open up an issue because

453
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,830
usually it's just a couple more minutes

454
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,720
of time so designers think more about

455
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,200
code structure and implementation which

456
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,820
I strongly believe makes you a better

457
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,050
designer it reinforces the process

458
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,540
aspect of it and developers think more

459
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
about design experience and of course

460
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,060
you guys already do I get it we are we

461
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,640
always try to understand the process the

462
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,580
development process as well I think this

463
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,850
just makes it a little bit stronger but

464
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,530
what this really all kind of boils down

465
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,580
to is that it's all about empathy

466
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,840
once you start to understand your

467
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,020
co-workers challenges once they start to

468
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,700
understand yours you can actually help

469
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,430
each other and this speaks volumes to

470
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,860
what the product starts to feel like and

471
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,410
what the users wind up seeing with this

472
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,510
so it's empathy between your co-workers

473
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,260
is empathy with your users which is

474
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,200
really powerful and the onus isn't on

475
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
developers this isn't hey how come

476
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,640
you're not letting designers in that's

477
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,770
not the problem designers have to be

478
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,930
just as willing to participate I've seen

479
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,150
with plenty of designers who don't want

480
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,600
to participate so I think it's it

481
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,210
obviously takes both sides to get that

482
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,020
process figure it out and that's that's

483
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,410
it keep in touch again my twitter handle

484
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,980
it hound I really urge you guys to go

485
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,620
check that out I love to hear some

486
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,960
feedback on it and yeah thank you very

487
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,250
much if you have any questions come see
