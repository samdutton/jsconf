00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,240

yeah hi hi hi Jessica my sling so as

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,099
florida has introduced my dear

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,230
co-presenter is gonna be bailiff for

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,120
today and you should you could see them

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,800
holding yesterday's beer which they

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,680
enjoyed very much so we're gonna be

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,400
talking about 2560 bites is out to be a

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,740
enough for i mean if you don't get that

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,740
if you don't get this reference you

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,900
probably are pretty old or you just

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,540
watch a lot of memes on the internet so

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,700
my name is foggy which is the short for

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,920
each transposon skier from hungary or at

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,660
least is still rent an apartment there i

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,850
work basically doing devrel and a bunch

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,910
of other new technologies i'm a missile

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,440
attack speaker i've worked with the

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,420
missile devrel team doing the same thing

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,660
and i'm doing a bunch of JavaScript or

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,550
microcontroller stuff and hardware in

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,770
general so i'm a member of the castle

22
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,320
project which is basically what brought

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,449
me into hardware in the first place like

24
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:04,860
you're free years ago when this thing

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,880
went on one of the the crowdfunding

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,979
campaigns i ordered one and i started

27
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,960
playing around with that and did my

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,270
first presentation in budapest is a and

29
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,330
i JavaScript or microcontrollers and you

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,670
know basically he convincing people that

31
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,590
you know running JavaScript on a

32
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,330
microcontroller might actually be a good

33
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,340
idea or at least not being a terrible

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,759
idea

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,909
so why would that be I'm not sure this

36
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,350
talk is gonna sell it to you but

37
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,409
actually one of the creators john mckay

38
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,140
is giving you talk has given a talk last

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,060
year rebels talking about the whole

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,790
journey of the tehsil team there's a

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,799
reading list you should read up on this

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,479
it's it's fascinating how they use

43
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,460
javascript and not really use javascript

44
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,229
or a microcontroller and there are other

45
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,090
devices like yes pro you know that you

46
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,939
see on this screen this is like the

47
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,799
thing that you see is an USB connector

48
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,229
so this is literally a ton by size and

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,939
you can program this with javascript it

50
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,829
had a very strange javascript compiler

51
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,770
like javascript engine running on it and

52
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,810
something didn't think that was a that

53
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,120
was okay so they set out you to bring

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,480
javascript properly on

55
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,629
my controllers to be honest like yes

56
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:19,840
purino has has improved a lot since so

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,849
aspirin has also very capable chipped

58
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,790
and by now but but Samsung came up with

59
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,090
and eventually open sources Jerry script

60
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,959
which is you know it powers a lot of

61
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,870
devices you can program for example BBC

62
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,599
micro bits on it so it's a pretty pretty

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,299
interesting stuff happening and I forgot

64
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,730
to set this up so let me just set

65
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,840
hopefully yeah yep

66
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,260
no not yet okay that's not good not

67
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,989
working technical difficulties I guess

68
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,650
alright we'll see if we can get this to

69
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:13,299
work now you're talking

70
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:16,750
alrighty so let's talk about a bunch of

71
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,329
more interesting stuff like JavaScript

72
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:23,200
overt IOT just two years ago here and on

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,209
this very stage maybe in this exact

74
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,910
stage Babel announced that they are

75
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,709
actually running JavaScript on their

76
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,930
pebble watches and they actually didn't

77
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,000
stop until they could get script running

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,639
as fast and there's battery efficient as

79
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,400
they could run Java C code on the

80
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,349
microcontroller so you can see she

81
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,440
wanted fertilized of codes versus 39

82
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,870
lines of JavaScript app over indeed the

83
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,680
UI of a SmartWatch and when they want

84
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,299
defunct last year they actually bought

85
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,150
got bought out by Fitbit and my watch is

86
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,310
actually running JavaScript on the UI so

87
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,109
you can actually create apps and stuff

88
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,069
for your watch on a JavaScript but we

89
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,660
need to get smaller like these are

90
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,180
pretty capable motive chips so how about

91
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,620
putting JavaScript and D or

92
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,720
microcontroller like this have you ever

93
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,780
played with Arduinos before this is a

94
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,669
8-bit processor this is an order you

95
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,030
know micro it literally has two thousand

96
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,430
and five hundred sixty bytes of memory

97
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,170
it has it holds 30k of Flash

98
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,900
and you can do stuff like put space

99
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,630
invaders on it how well there are a

100
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,490
bunch of ways usually you use the

101
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,370
Arduino IDE and some C or C++ to code

102
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,340
that I created a small project that that

103
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,010
you can do this with JavaScript it

104
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,840
actually turns your JavaScript into C++

105
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,570
it's a good thing and he just mentioned

106
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,310
flow it actually uses flow in the

107
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,380
backend to infer your types and stuff I

108
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,090
don't have time to explain it but if you

109
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,120
want to just come up to me and try it

110
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,040
yourself and because that's all the

111
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,540
games that you're gonna be making or

112
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,920
they're going to be just JavaScript you

113
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,410
can just put them onto the web and play

114
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,170
them and after you play them you can

115
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,540
compile them and put them on T devices

116
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,630
like this one so this is a JavaScript

117
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,080
game running on a microcontroller

118
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,580
compiled for a microcontroller hardware

119
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,970
that has a 8 bit 16 megahertz processor

120
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,330
and you know if that's not enough you

121
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,400
know you can use this one which is

122
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,830
literally a tiny arcade that's the name

123
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,160
it's a tiny arcade box that you could

124
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,130
play with why would you why is that

125
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,140
interesting because this is just the web

126
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,060
this is just JavaScript and chemistry of

127
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,060
writing and you can check that because I

128
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,670
have some links up if you go to this on

129
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,380
with your computer or your laptop

130
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,600
actually you can play the exact same

131
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,460
game that is get that gets compiled down

132
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,080
to the microcontroller and the gaming

133
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,300
devices we have space invaders if you're

134
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,210
into that kind of stuff and we also have

135
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,030
a workshop so if your Icelandic or if

136
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,440
you're gonna be driving around the

137
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,690
island for next week just drop by

138
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,030
Reykjavik University next Saturday and

139
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,790
we're actually gonna do a whole workshop

140
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,220
we are creators of these devices

141
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,050
actually were kind enough to provide us

142
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,090
with a bunch of devices so you can't

143
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,130
actually play with JavaScript kid games

144
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,870
and put them onto a microcontroller and

145
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,000
play around with those and next Saturday

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
there is a link in there as well

147
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,660
and if you want to talk to you about

148
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,200
these kind of stuff at me at Twitter at

149
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,200
SL softworks or follow at cloud boy for

150
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,970
the new stuff all of this is open source

151
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,160
most of this is built on nodejs and

152
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,590
javascript so the whole server and hold

153
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,870
is all based in JavaScript so you can

154
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,560
contribute if you if you want you and

155
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,110
all the slides are online at Todd does

156
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,150
like that is yes that's a nice landing

157
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,150
domain right / place let's chase convice

158
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,250
land so thank you very much

159
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,139
there's a reading list and links if you

160
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,570
want to know more about these topics
