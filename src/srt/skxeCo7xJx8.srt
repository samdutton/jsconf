1
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,700

that'll be relevant in just a couple

2
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,529
minutes I promise so hi everyone um I'm

3
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:27,140
Liv Ericksson i am a virtual and

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,910
augmented reality developer evangelist

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,140
from a little company you may have heard

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,050
of called microsoft if you want to be

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,239
inundated with more tweets about virtual

8
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:36,589
reality than you ever thought a single

9
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:38,629
human could produce this is my Twitter

10
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:41,449
account I love talking about VR just

11
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:43,820
about as much as this picture shows you

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,190
can probably guess I absolutely adore

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,899
immersive technologies and I'm really

14
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,120
really excited to be here with you today

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,360
to share this so I'm going to jump right

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,850
into it and start with the big question

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,050
why care about virtual reality and why

18
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,769
work on virtual reality I generally

19
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:05,840
wouldn't give this device to people I

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,580
get asked a lot what made you get into

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,940
VR AR and I was in the situation where I

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,590
made my entire life decision on what I

23
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,790
wanted to do with my career based off of

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,360
a YouTube video again not something I

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,310
generally recommend people do but I

26
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,530
moved out to the San Francisco Bay Area

27
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,170
three years ago and I wanted to find a

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,180
technology that I just wanted to spend

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,490
all my time doing and loved very

30
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,619
passionately and I saw a video where

31
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,869
someone was talking about the oculus

32
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,090
rift developer kit too and I was

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,560
immediately like yep that's it i'm going

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,759
to just drop everything that I have

35
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,700
learned up until this point and do VR so

36
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,460
y vr it's changing the way that we think

37
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,470
about computing and I'm gonna start with

38
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,430
this one it's really really fun I was in

39
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,049
the situation when I first got out of

40
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,640
college that I didn't have this passion

41
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,320
for what I was working on I had a great

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,090
team I was kind of like okay this is

43
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,280
cool but I never really made this

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,540
connection that what I should be working

45
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,060
on should just be really fun and I

46
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,649
really loved it and I needed to find

47
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:08,630
something in my life that I found really

48
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,360
fun and virtual reality was one of those

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,570
things having this ability to be

50
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,549
transported to an entirely new world

51
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:19,790
elevates storytelling and as humans we

52
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,530
like telling stories we like to relate

53
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,190
to each other through stories

54
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,950
having access to an unlimited number of

55
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,400
virtual places that basically I create

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,080
out of something that I think about and

57
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,070
like yeah you know what that sounds

58
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,050
really cool I want to do that it's

59
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,240
opening up this whole new world where we

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,820
can actually build anything that we

61
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,210
think of this is a picture from my very

62
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,430
first virtual reality experience that I

63
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,580
ever did I spent my entire life loving

64
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,590
Star Wars any other Star Wars fans in

65
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,030
the audience I pretty sure I can't be

66
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,960
the only one yeah yeah okay um so my

67
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,560
very first gr experience was living out

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,330
a dream that I had had since I was five

69
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,420
years old in getting to do a lightsaber

70
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,220
training demo that was the same thing

71
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,230
that Luke did when he got on to the

72
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,000
Millennium Falcon in the first movie and

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,220
that was really kind of eye-opening for

74
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,380
me was experiencing this technology and

75
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,460
realizing that it had the potential to

76
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,440
help me live out this kind of fantasy

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,790
world dream that I had never thought

78
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,500
would be something I could physically do

79
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,030
virtual reality is changing the way that

80
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,130
we relate to each other that talk on

81
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,440
empathy was absolutely amazing and it

82
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,050
really hits home a lot of these points

83
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,670
that we are constantly seeking out new

84
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,030
ways to relate to each other so this is

85
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,550
a picture from when I went and visited

86
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,170
my parents these are my parents they're

87
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,810
being featured prominently here I took

88
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,400
that with this camera that you just saw

89
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,140
me kind of hide behind the podium and

90
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,810
take earlier because there's my sister's

91
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,220
missing from this picture I went back

92
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,570
home to visit them but she wasn't able

93
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,540
to take off work and with kind of this

94
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,310
immersive technology that's developing

95
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,500
in this ecosystem I was able to take

96
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,269
this picture that I can stick into a

97
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:04,920
headset and it's like I can go back to

98
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,709
that place in time and I can remember

99
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,910
exactly where I was what that felt like

100
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,130
and I can have other people experience

101
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,590
that very specific part of my life

102
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,989
that's very important to me for all of

103
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,970
you I just took a picture standing on

104
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,799
stage behind the podium because I'm

105
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,890
nervous and I I know that when I talk to

106
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,450
people after I give talks you know some

107
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,040
of them are oh I would love to speak but

108
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,080
I don't know what it's like and we now

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,340
have the technology where you can see

110
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,289
exactly what it's like to be standing in

111
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:34,110
my footsteps right here on stage at this

112
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,419
very moment and in the future I get to

113
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:36,780
come back

114
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,610
and revisit that to which I find

115
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,620
fascinating and it's changing how we

116
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,040
relate to technology I love this picture

117
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,500
I love this picture for a lot of

118
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,730
different reasons but what I love about

119
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,560
it is that it really captures this idea

120
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,980
of thinking about robots in this case

121
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,740
but technology in general in new ways

122
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,840
that are more human they're more

123
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,270
personal we're able to start thinking

124
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,270
about devices and how they play into our

125
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,060
lives on a very new level that we

126
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,120
haven't quite had before you know almost

127
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,770
everyone in this room if not everyone

128
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,930
has a device that they're carrying

129
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,180
around that connects them to the people

130
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,500
they love the information that's

131
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,690
important to them and virtual reality

132
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,070
starts to elevate that when you can

133
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,160
stand inside rooms and interact with

134
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,560
data in ways that are more realistic

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,900
more like the world that we're used to

136
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,479
experiencing compared to more

137
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,180
traditional computing platforms vr has

138
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,300
benefits around fundamentally changing

139
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,610
that way that we interact with

140
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,000
technology so you'll see in a few

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,220
minutes an example of a demo that I've

142
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,070
built that takes Excel data and graphs

143
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,910
it in 3d for me I love technology but I

144
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,080
haven't really hard time looking and

145
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,550
remembering charts and being like okay I

146
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,510
know that was telling me something

147
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,610
important but what was that and when you

148
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,470
start to think about data in ways that

149
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,070
relate it back to what you're

150
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,770
experiencing something like the price of

151
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,300
something in stacks of dollar bills

152
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,810
becomes a lot more memorable than if you

153
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,900
simply saw a number and started to try

154
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,950
to remember what that meant because

155
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,810
we're spatial creatures we interact with

156
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,910
things in 3d all the time that's how our

157
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,780
world works as we know it so before we

158
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,300
even dive into the VR web I want to

159
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,870
start with this going over what the VR

160
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,700
ecosystem today looks like so first we

161
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,720
have probably the most common mobile VR

162
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,919
device type available and this is

163
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,720
powered by a smartphone it's a device

164
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,750
that is essentially allowing your server

165
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,060
or your your phone to serve as the

166
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,110
processor and display for a VR

167
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,300
a device have any of you do any of you

168
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,570
have a mobile VR device a few of you

169
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,430
good okay that's good that every time I

170
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,230
ask that question at a talk that number

171
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,520
goes up which makes me personally really

172
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,960
excited because I feel like I'm I'm

173
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,430
doing the right kind of talk for kind of

174
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,370
how the industry is growing and evolving

175
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,500
so mobile VR like i mentioned allows

176
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,180
your phone to serve as the primary

177
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,960
processor behind all of these

178
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,610
applications and the applications are

179
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,020
running are just generally simple

180
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,790
smartphone applications you have a

181
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,410
number of internal sensors that are

182
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,260
measuring rotation and head orientation

183
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,550
so it's tracking kind of where you're

184
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,320
moving feels very natural and updates

185
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,880
the screen accordingly but it tends to

186
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,250
be a less powerful or immersive

187
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,110
experience than what you're capable of

188
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,670
running in something like a desktop via

189
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,310
our device with desktop ER devices

190
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,770
you're generally running standard PC

191
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,870
applications your head mounted display

192
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,030
is entirely separate you're not powering

193
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,800
this from the device itself you're

194
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,480
powering it from an external computer

195
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,070
which generally means that you're

196
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,260
tethered in you still have a number of

197
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,150
those sensors that are measuring the

198
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,040
head tracking the orientation of your

199
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,330
head and where you're looking but you

200
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,690
also have a number of other potential

201
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,670
devices like seeing here you could have

202
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,230
hand tracked controllers you could have

203
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,900
full room scale tracking systems that

204
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,860
are watching where you're moving around

205
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,570
so if I move over here it'll know that

206
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,580
and you end up with a more powerful

207
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,230
experience but again at the expense that

208
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,940
you're tethered to a desktop lastly and

209
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,460
this is very very kind of like broadly

210
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,380
separating VR devices into these three

211
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,360
categories and this is changing almost

212
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,460
monthly now but if I went through and

213
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,020
listed everyone we'd go way past 30

214
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,800
minutes and there's a lot more

215
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,110
interesting stuff to talk about the last

216
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,790
one is standalone devices and these are

217
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,590
devices that are all in one everything

218
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,200
is contained in this case the headset in

219
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,880
the headset and the controller but also

220
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,770
sometimes just at a headset itself and

221
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,680
they can be mobile or desktop operating

222
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,930
system based they may be hybrid devices

223
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,790
in the example of this headset you can

224
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,320
actually take the controller away which

225
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,970
is where all of the processing is done

226
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,740
and plug it into a desktop so you have a

227
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,020
different model but what you're starting

228
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,880
to see here in the industry is that new

229
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,380
devices are coming out and playing and

230
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,030
pushing the boundaries of what's

231
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,800
possible with immersive technologies

232
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,850
today

233
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,819
and if you haven't had a chance to try

234
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:09,009
any of those find me tomorrow because

235
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,480
i'll have my gear vr with me and i'm

236
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,980
more than happy to do demos I love

237
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,509
showing people V our stuff for the first

238
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:17,829
time so why think about the browser as a

239
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:20,410
platform for virtual reality experiences

240
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,800
in the future right now we're still at a

241
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,810
relatively early stage for this wave of

242
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,420
VR it's come around a couple of times in

243
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,069
the past it never really landed but

244
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,779
we're starting to see this resurgence of

245
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,459
the technology because we finally are in

246
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:35,860
a position where we have developer

247
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,540
conferences like this to get developers

248
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,220
excited about building applications for

249
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,230
immersive technology we're a lot more

250
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,360
comfortable with technology and putting

251
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,709
stuff on our faces and running around

252
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,930
with goggles on and we haven't really

253
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,490
reached the point yet where there are

254
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,829
you know best practices that are defined

255
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:52,839
or set standards which makes it a really

256
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,730
fun and interesting time to just get in

257
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,639
and start experimenting so when you're

258
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,069
considering all of this the browser as a

259
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:01,779
platform for virtual reality becomes

260
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:05,230
really interesting a lot of the things

261
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,630
that make the browser a really good

262
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,279
option for a lot of applications today

263
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,009
are also paralleled when building for VR

264
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:14,649
you have the ability to build an app and

265
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,300
not have to think about what it's

266
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,300
running on that's a very very

267
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,860
generalized statement because of course

268
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,360
at this stage you have to think about

269
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,620
kind of what you're running on from a

270
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,660
design perspective and feature

271
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,750
implementation but the benefit of the

272
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,550
virtual reality web is that you can have

273
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,639
an application and start building out

274
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,050
that experience that will work

275
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,880
regardless of the device that you're

276
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,100
using it on or if you're even using a VR

277
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,670
device at all this is really good when

278
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,990
you're kind of starting out with vr

279
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,399
development because it allows you to

280
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,870
focus on the content rather than

281
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,509
learning kind of the ins and outs of one

282
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:51,370
particular platform because as I just

283
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,380
mentioned there's a huge number of those

284
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,329
and it's changing almost monthly at this

285
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:59,319
point you have open access to content

286
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:02,380
which is really critical for virtual

287
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,880
reality experiences because we haven't

288
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,829
really figured out how to define them

289
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:08,350
yet in a situation where you have maybe

290
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,230
a three minute experience in VR that

291
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,689
captures very specific content like one

292
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:17,260
maybe a festival experience is that a

293
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,920
nap

294
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,350
is that a smaller piece of consumable

295
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,350
content is that a news story and when

296
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,089
you are building these out to run

297
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,410
natively and you're going through an app

298
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,269
store you're at someone else's ability

299
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:30,130
to decide whether or not it's a game or

300
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,769
if it's an article and whether or not

301
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:34,449
it's a big enough scope to put on the

302
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:36,639
App Store so when you think about the

303
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,220
web as a content platform for virtual

304
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,560
reality you have a lot more flexibility

305
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,810
over that control and what experiences

306
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,800
you're able to distribute you're letting

307
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,040
the browser do a lot of the work will

308
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,690
get into the specifics about the web via

309
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,430
our API in just a second but at its core

310
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,070
looking at the browser as a VR platform

311
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,220
allows you to let the browser take care

312
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,290
of a lot of things that individual SDKs

313
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,880
would otherwise that you would have to

314
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,649
be implementing separately in your

315
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:11,290
application so one of these benefits is

316
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,550
that you are able to look at

317
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,380
cross-platform development and say I

318
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,880
don't even want to think about whether

319
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,980
or not I'm running on a desktop with an

320
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,230
oculus rift or a mobile phone with the

321
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,500
browser in a cardboard headset I just

322
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,089
want it to work and I want it to look

323
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,459
good if you're not running VR headsets

324
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:31,360
at all and you lastly which I like in

325
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,730
terms of developing for VR you get to

326
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,140
bring your favorite web technologies

327
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,510
with you it's JavaScript rendering all

328
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,060
of this in a WebGL context you can build

329
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,339
on top of your favorite sites your

330
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:43,839
favorite technologies you can add this

331
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,670
to things that already exist because of

332
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,820
that framework and those that potential

333
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,040
for adding that layer of 3d graphics

334
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,589
lets you really build some really cool

335
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:54,970
stuff with all of the things that

336
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,740
already exist in the JavaScript

337
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,550
ecosystem so when you start to look at

338
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,470
building the VR web the elements of

339
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,990
today's ecosystem you know it's not just

340
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,300
one specific platform one specific

341
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,269
framework though it does generally share

342
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:13,209
that core around the web view our API

343
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,730
however there's a lot of flexibility in

344
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,709
how you can start building virtual

345
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:21,279
reality web applications today so at the

346
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,470
very top level where you look at 3d

347
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,360
JavaScript libraries because these are

348
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,310
what's going to make up the majority of

349
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,660
what someone will see in your

350
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,250
application so one of the first

351
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,660
considerations is

352
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,580
how am I going to build this environment

353
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,830
what do I want people to be inside of

354
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,390
and experiencing when I'm building an

355
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,880
application JavaScript libraries like

356
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,100
3gs in Babylon provide these ecosystems

357
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,380
to build out 3d applications so that you

358
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,200
don't have to write a rate caster or

359
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,600
shaders yourself or even go through and

360
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,280
worry about writing and defining objects

361
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,720
and primitives these libraries kind of

362
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,980
take that off so you can think about

363
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,660
okay what is it exactly that I'm

364
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,160
building and how do I have those tools

365
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,950
to do that and both of these libraries

366
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,830
have support for web PR today so when we

367
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,800
look into the web view our API it's an

368
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,540
experimental API for browsers that

369
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,000
allows the browser to handle all of

370
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,280
those interactions with VR hardware so

371
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,930
it identifies corrected connected

372
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,030
peripherals that you may have so in the

373
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,070
case of say a vibe room scale system it

374
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,230
identifies you know that you are in a

375
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,780
room that's tracking VR and you as a

376
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,250
developer just kind of have access to

377
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,930
that you don't have to worry about you

378
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,970
know doing different checks of what type

379
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,380
of device and my running is it actually

380
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,090
connected at all is this a mobile phone

381
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,040
that's running in a headset the browser

382
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,020
does all of that and it then passes in

383
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,850
that display data so that a camera and

384
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,770
your scene can just update seamlessly

385
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,630
with whatever is happening on the device

386
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,710
and you don't have to worry about

387
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,290
interacting with the hardware right now

388
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,690
the webview our API is supported in

389
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,430
Firefox nightly in chromium with paths

390
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,960
to both of those browsers longer-term

391
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,600
under the hood in web be our API it

392
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,760
breaks down virtual reality devices into

393
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,830
different components so that you can

394
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,120
access the different parts of the

395
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,670
hardware some of the interfaces are

396
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,710
related specifically to rendering a vr

397
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,150
seen appropriately for different

398
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,860
headsets while others will handle things

399
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,720
like the orientation the expense ability

400
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,910
to provide additional services like with

401
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,840
gamepad or audio and for a desktop a VR

402
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,030
device you may see things that are

403
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,410
completely separate from the headset

404
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,000
itself like additional tracking cameras

405
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,250
or controllers for a mobile phone it may

406
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,740
just be kind of making up that this

407
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,860
exists and getting those capabilities to

408
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,260
provide the implementation itself so

409
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,880
under the hood you're looking at the

410
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,770
base of all vr devices which is a vr

411
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,600
display whether or not that's you know

412
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,430
all contained in one package or if it's

413
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,650
in a number of different devices the API

414
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,450
will recognize these devices and pass

415
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,550
those on and say hey

416
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,170
you have this plugged in you can use

417
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,230
this at the state of any at any given

418
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,430
time the state of the headset will be

419
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,380
saved in the VR pose so it will know the

420
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,580
difference if I'm looking here as

421
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,320
opposed forces if I'm looking there as a

422
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,850
different pose and all of that

423
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,160
transitional data in between gets handed

424
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,670
off to the application to use in in the

425
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,480
situation where you are say running a

426
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,399
full-scale VR experience you'll also

427
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,899
have the stage parameters which will

428
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,540
tell the browser application you have X

429
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,730
amount of space to move before you will

430
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,250
hit the boundaries of this and as I

431
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,170
mentioned extensions for a lot of other

432
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,420
interfaces are also provided and if

433
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,640
you're interested you can go right there

434
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,810
and then so when you look at the kind of

435
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,300
over arching libraries and developing

436
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,480
for web PR it reuses a lot of libraries

437
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,200
as i mentioned that regular 2d 2d

438
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,040
display 3d applications will use with

439
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,380
3gs babylon and there's a few libraries

440
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,209
that sit on top of that and essentially

441
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,790
will just pipe in a camera update and

442
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,870
provide all of the additional

443
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,110
functionality of having that headset on

444
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,839
the web via our framework contains three

445
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,149
major components for working with

446
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,310
browsers that have desktop headsets

447
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,959
plugged in and then a polyfill that

448
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,250
fills in all the rest when you're on a

449
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,740
mobile device so the VR controls apply

450
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,929
the headset transforms to a scene camera

451
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:10,350
the VR effect is going to calculate and

452
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,970
tell your application how it should

453
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,069
render your application depending on the

454
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,559
screen size the pixel density resolution

455
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,730
which changes from device to device

456
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,439
especially when you look at mobile VR

457
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,780
and then the web viewer manager handles

458
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,270
moving in and out of web PR and non web

459
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,040
PR mode which I'll show in just a second

460
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,880
but of course there's always more

461
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,990
there's actually a pretty rich ecosystem

462
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,820
being built on top of the web view our

463
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,160
libraries that make it even easier to

464
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,080
develop if you're just starting out for

465
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,550
virtual reality applications and these

466
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,140
are generally wrappers around the

467
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,000
JavaScript implementation of the web PR

468
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,809
API that you can use if you maybe prefer

469
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,280
markup style languages like a frame and

470
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,750
visual programming systems like visor

471
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,960
create these are options that are

472
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,370
available to let you kind of program

473
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,320
right in your browser

474
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,630
an experiment with different different

475
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,789
scenes different kind of technologies to

476
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,740
figure out what works best for your

477
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,880
specific experience and they they just

478
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,830
provide a couple of options because who

479
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,159
doesn't like options for development if

480
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,009
you are familiar with game programming

481
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:17,899
and game development there's also the

482
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,429
ability now with the Unity game engine

483
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:21,500
to build an application and export it

484
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,399
directly to a WebGL web VR seen this

485
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:28,580
lets you use JavaScript c-sharp boo to

486
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,750
write scripts in the Unity game engine

487
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,360
and you add in a plug-in that says I'm

488
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,549
going to export this to the web and I

489
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,009
want it to support VR and then all of

490
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:38,720
the desktop browsers that support what

491
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,220
VR will also let you do that in the

492
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,690
application and I'll have a video of

493
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,360
this in just a second because that's

494
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,279
enough talking you probably want to

495
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,830
start seeing this in action as a heads

496
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,659
up these are some videos that i have

497
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:53,480
taken from inside a VR headset so if

498
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,070
you're very very prone to motion

499
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,320
sickness it may get a little wobbly at

500
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,179
times on the screen just as a heads up

501
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,399
for that so the first thing that I'm

502
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:05,120
going to show you is a video of the

503
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,470
application that i was talking about

504
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,879
earlier and this is a way of taking a

505
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:14,480
traditional data set that you have and

506
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,070
looking at it in an entirely different

507
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,019
way so i'm going to go ahead and this

508
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:20,629
was shot on of mobile phone you can see

509
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:22,279
when i'm starting out it's just a

510
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,500
regular website you don't have to be in

511
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,110
VR mode for it and I'm going to go ahead

512
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,070
and see if I can play that there so this

513
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,870
is just using a bootstrap template to

514
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,269
kind of render everything because you

515
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:36,470
want to just be able to kind of have

516
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,669
those experiences that users are

517
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,759
familiar with and then it loads in a web

518
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,860
vr scene that's rendering this graph

519
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,379
that I took from the Excel data and

520
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:47,840
putting it into 3d when I switched it

521
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,519
into VR mode it starts rendering

522
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,289
stereoscopically side by side so that if

523
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,330
I was wearing this on my head it would

524
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,100
now be rendering appropriately for my

525
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,379
eyes and I can look around and I can see

526
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,360
this and it's a little bit hard to tell

527
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,950
on a video screen kind of cuz this

528
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,289
screen itself is very large but for me

529
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,940
being able to kind of stand inside of

530
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,220
this graph and see things like oh yeah

531
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,889
the cost of living in San Francisco is

532
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:11,180
very very

533
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,920
large and instead of having this kind of

534
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,900
arbitrary scale these are in units of me

535
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,370
like I'm standing there and I can look

536
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:21,250
up and see 700 Livi's standing there for

537
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,870
comparative kind of analysis of the cost

538
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,580
of living so this next sample that I

539
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,970
built here is using a frame which is as

540
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,980
I kind of rushed through a little bit

541
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,110
earlier there a markup styled language

542
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,500
from ma's VRS team where you can

543
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,270
essentially use markup to wrap around

544
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,730
three jas objects and create virtual

545
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,030
reality scenes this is a live link so if

546
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,010
we want to test out the conference Wi-Fi

547
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,140
here and you want to see for yourself

548
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,190
what this looks like on a mobile device

549
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,090
you can go there I as you can see love

550
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,910
my little 360 camera and I'm going to

551
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,860
actually go ahead and switch over to the

552
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,110
scene live so you can get a scene get a

553
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,190
sense of what it looks like on the

554
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,080
desktop browser but up here in the

555
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,610
corner you can see that's what it looks

556
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,200
like on a mobile phone very similar to

557
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,670
the application that I just showed you

558
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,830
because again it's using all of the same

559
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,710
underlying frameworks there but I've

560
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,300
built this scene out based on some

561
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,830
pictures that I've taken from this trip

562
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,420
already I've showed this before or rough

563
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,410
a rough kind of similar version of this

564
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,050
application but the cool thing about a

565
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,260
frame is that this takes 17 lines of

566
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,420
code this is the entire website that you

567
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,090
just saw excluding that one script

568
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,710
source so I'm cheating a little bit

569
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,410
there but if we go ahead over and switch

570
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,970
into the browser here I don't have a

571
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,410
desktop view our device plugged in

572
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,880
because I don't have a desktop with me

573
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,810
um and that's not showing so let me let

574
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,530
me switch that over real quick I

575
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,640
apologize if I break the projection

576
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,070
system for like all the other stuff so

577
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,840
you can see here that I've actually got

578
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,480
this scene that's showing a 360 video or

579
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,100
a picture that I took at the blue lagoon

580
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,860
on Tuesday so I can look around with

581
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,740
this since I'm not using a VR device I

582
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,540
can use my mouse to just kind of click

583
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,900
and drag and this renders the way it

584
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,230
would in any browser and it's not in VR

585
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,610
mode because the browser is detecting I

586
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,530
don't have anything plugged in if I did

587
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,210
I have this little button down here and

588
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:23,830
it's not

589
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,210
let me click on it because I don't have

590
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,269
a headset plugged in but if we switch

591
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:31,630
back over to the slides and i'll see if

592
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,220
i can get this you get a sneak preview

593
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:42,269
of the next slide here oh no let's see

594
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:49,639
well you know what I'll just keep well

595
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:51,850
so it happens when you try to show the

596
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:57,100
live demos but we'll just duplicate it

597
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,240
and you can go through the rest of my

598
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:08,190
slides with me

599
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,230
perfect all right and so you can see

600
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,070
that that's handling all of the code

601
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,080
that I didn't have like all of the the

602
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,549
webview are switching and everything

603
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:20,649
like that really powerful framework

604
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,580
there this video here is what i was

605
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,080
mentioning earlier with the export from

606
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,330
the unity engine into a web view our

607
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,549
site so i'm going to go ahead and just

608
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:31,809
click on this real quick to show you

609
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:36,850
that this is sitting in a WebGL canvas

610
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,830
and i recorded this from my desktop

611
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,630
using my oculus rift so I put this on

612
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,610
I'm looking around in my head set its

613
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,110
tracking all of that and passing that

614
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,659
into the WebGL contacts and I don't

615
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,220
really have to do anything specific to

616
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,559
say I wanted this to work on the browser

617
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,630
it's the similar export function that I

618
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,889
could have used if I was building it to

619
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:55,720
a desktop application but I was able to

620
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,889
just say I'm gonna stick this in a

621
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:59,710
website and go with it so I'm going to

622
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:05,080
switch back to this real quick because I

623
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,260
think that this kind of starts to show a

624
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,190
lot of where browser-based VR will make

625
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,659
the most sense kind of in the short term

626
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:16,120
and that's in that right now not

627
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,279
everybody does have a VR device you need

628
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,389
to start thinking about these

629
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:22,539
experiences in a very hybrid sort of way

630
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,220
which is hard to do if you're building

631
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,899
native applications for VR either

632
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,809
they're in the VR app or they're not but

633
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:30,460
when you start to think about the web as

634
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,590
a platform for VR you have a lot more

635
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,419
flexibility with how you're able to

636
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,220
build out these experiences to work in

637
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,659
that kind of hybrid model you know

638
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:40,120
sometimes we do have our phones and we

639
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,799
want to do you know we want to have that

640
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,179
flexibility of looking around with the

641
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:44,769
phone and put it put that in the headset

642
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,029
real quick you can imagine if you were

643
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:47,620
shopping for something online maybe new

644
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,539
furniture you wanted to say you know oh

645
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,580
that looks really cool but how big is it

646
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,080
really and you can put that headset on

647
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,200
super fast see the size of the furniture

648
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,539
the color of different apple and you

649
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,470
want to see what that color of the

650
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,360
dresses and you have that ability to

651
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,760
kind of look in this experience and be

652
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,080
navigating through and working with

653
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,289
stuff in a very seamless way so looking

654
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:10,419
ahead and thinking about kind of what

655
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,809
the future of VR in the browser looks

656
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:16,149
like these are all things that are

657
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:18,309
evolving really really rapidly over the

658
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,799
coming years as VR is becoming more and

659
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,010
more widely adopted

660
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,400
over 5 million cardboard units were

661
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,830
shipped in as of January this year and

662
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,500
that was what nine months ago almost and

663
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,720
the market is like regularly making

664
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,220
improvements new devices are being

665
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,940
announced support for browser-based VR

666
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,200
for these devices are being announced

667
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,010
just yesterday actually the open-source

668
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,670
VR headset and the developer kits have

669
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,020
released their support for the

670
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,740
browser-based VR and because of the way

671
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,110
the kind of virtual and augmented

672
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,420
reality are blending together even at

673
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,890
this early stage there are custom

674
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,180
browsers with in virtual reality

675
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,490
applications that are starting to add

676
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,100
support for holographic content so you

677
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,170
can almost have like a augmented or

678
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,510
mixed reality scene inside of a virtual

679
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,690
reality application based on web PR so

680
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,580
you can write a web view our site view

681
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,260
it in VR and then have that come to life

682
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,480
within another virtual environment you

683
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,300
start to get at a very inception level

684
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,790
kind of thing we're really at the

685
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,130
beginning like the potential with all of

686
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,210
the different smart and connected

687
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,070
devices we have around the internet of

688
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,590
things around biometric devices Big Data

689
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,630
machine learning starting to bring all

690
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,130
of the tools that the web has kind of

691
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,450
been evolving over the past several

692
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,510
decades into immersive content brings

693
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,910
with it a lot of capabilities and a lot

694
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,400
of potential for very very interesting

695
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,130
applications in the future of course

696
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,140
there are always challenges with things

697
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,150
like this bringing browser performance

698
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,600
with 3d content on par with native

699
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,160
applications and around framerate

700
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,750
latency it's a little bit of a challenge

701
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,400
but I've seen some really compelling

702
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,470
examples of people hitting 90 frames per

703
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,440
second and some of these experimental

704
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,340
browsers and custom builds of

705
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,990
development browsers so we're getting

706
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,370
there and it's definitely something

707
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,340
that's going to be feasible when you

708
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,480
start looking at different types of

709
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,980
applications and of course the content

710
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,300
that you're building is going to depend

711
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,340
a lot on the requirements for your

712
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,070
performance in the first example if

713
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,830
you're building an Excel chart you're

714
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,060
viewing an Excel chart without a lot of

715
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,590
heavy animations that's going to be a

716
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,000
lot different performance wise in the

717
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,580
browser than something like their full

718
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,710
3d 360 degree game that you're watching

719
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,230
or and playing with cross-platform

720
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,290
design experimentation as I met

721
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,540
right now a lot of the considerations

722
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,300
around building a web view our site come

723
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,940
less around technical decisions that you

724
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,050
may have to make but more around the

725
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,090
design considerations if you're wearing

726
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,390
a headset with a phone in it you're

727
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,610
going to have a different number of you

728
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,380
know interactions that are available to

729
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,610
you then if you're using something like

730
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,740
the vibe where you have a full room and

731
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,690
you have hand controllers and then

732
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,520
lastly getting really rich visual

733
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,300
editing tools in 3d at for building 3d

734
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,520
experiences in the browser is something

735
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,620
that is also again kind of being worked

736
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,850
on right now but it's at early stages

737
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,760
it's really challenging sometimes to

738
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,560
right things and knowing kind of what

739
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,390
the 3d coordinate system in the headsets

740
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,220
going to look like if I'm writing that

741
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,650
all in texts so if I know you know the

742
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,480
z-axis could be in front or behind me

743
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,190
where do I put things if I can't see

744
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,140
them relative to one another having

745
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,610
those visual editing tools makes a lot

746
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,290
of sense but we're starting to see more

747
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,730
and more opportunities where you don't

748
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,680
just have visual editing tools on the

749
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,240
monitor in front of you but you also get

750
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,550
them inside of a virtual application

751
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,470
yourself so you can sit there and code

752
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,150
and see these objects appearing next to

753
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,060
you as you're writing them so with that

754
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,610
I want everyone to go build something

755
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,270
awesome and there's so much that is out

756
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,550
there right now around the ecosystem if

757
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,170
you want to learn more I have a github

758
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,400
repository where I've been collecting

759
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,230
basically all of the resources I can

760
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,030
find about learning virtual reality

761
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,550
development in general design the

762
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,200
different options that you have I love

763
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,150
like I said tweeting and talking about

764
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,740
VR so if you have questions you can

765
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,410
tweet at me or you can you'll find me

766
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,000
I'll be around to the next two days love

767
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,230
to talk to you more about all of this

768
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,900
and with that I hope you're kind of

769
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,760
getting excited about immersive content

770
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,000
because right now you know the way that

771
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,470
we interact with a single screen or

772
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,420
multiple screens is fundamentally going

773
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,680
to be different how we interact when our

774
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,540
entire world and our entire environment

775
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,060
can be manipulated and changed and we

776
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,830
could have you know screens all over the

777
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,380
place or you know virtual things that

778
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,730
are sitting on stage to talk to you

779
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,650
about things and demoing things with you

780
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,870
so with that I want to thank you so much

781
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,450
for having me out here and I hope that
