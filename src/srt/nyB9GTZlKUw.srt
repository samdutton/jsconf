1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:21,400

you

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,520


3
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,040
I'm Pam Sally I'm from Philadelphia ish

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,070
have been there a few years now and I do

5
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,530
stuff I always like to put on my bio I

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,590
just make things on the internet but

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,450
especially in philadelphia i am known

8
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,860
for running around a bunch of various

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,390
communities involved in the Ruby

10
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,790
community and the Python community and I

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,460
teach and I've taught Ruby Python

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,000
JavaScript web development get and I

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,520
usually do that in low cost either free

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,340
or low-cost environments half the time

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,010
knock any pain and sometimes getting

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,460
paid a little bit so what I want to talk

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,409
about today is some of the existing

18
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:05,239
education programs that are in other

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,520
communities that I think the JavaScript

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,010
beanie really needs to learn from why

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,630
particularly the JavaScript community

22
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,340
has a very special problem that we need

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,280
to use education as a solution and how

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,670
we can how we have in Philadelphia use

25
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,090
education in our community so who's been

26
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,030
teaching so have any of you guys heard

27
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,800
of some of these were initiatives before

28
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,680
I hope yeah I hoped most of you because

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,780
they're really great things I've taught

30
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,119
for a few of them but my favorite

31
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,950
personal favorite biased I love the

32
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,079
Boston Python workshop because the

33
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,360
Boston fight that workshop is based in a

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,310
user group and they have these really

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,439
great results from the particular way

36
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,570
that they do things the other ones

37
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,829
actually so rails girls railsbridge pi

38
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:54,079
star and actually the Boston Python

39
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,759
workshop also follow us a two-day format

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,859
where you have one day where people get

41
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,509
ready the next day where there's a

42
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,969
workshop that kind of format but Boston

43
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:04,310
Python workshop is attached particularly

44
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,869
to a user group so that's what we do in

45
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:07,520
Philadelphia in the Philadelphia Python

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,009
user group and so Boston Python when

47
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,350
they started the workshop they had zero

48
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,120
representation of women they increased

49
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,120
it to fifteen percent lots of alumni and

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,010
same growth and if you want to learn

51
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,510
more about it they did a great talk last

52
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,850
year at PyCon about a lot of lessons

53
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,530
learned a lot more details about how

54
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,160
exactly they did it so why does

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,920
javascript need to so javascript is a

56
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,160
special snowflake oh

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,730
so javascript has the unique and totally

58
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,830
awesome and problematic thing where

59
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,600
anyone who does anything on the internet

60
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,030
really should probably know JavaScript

61
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,930
or they try to or act like they do so

62
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,640
it's number one language in the world

63
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,250
and so we have this unique kind of thing

64
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,470
where we have all these people who have

65
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,270
dabbled in a little bit of JavaScript

66
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,180
and they've picked up enough enough to

67
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,190
do what they need to do but they really

68
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,690
don't have a deep understanding or even

69
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,250
a shallow understanding a lot of the

70
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,040
fundamentals so when we talk about

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,160
teaching javascript to people we have a

72
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,620
unique thing that happens is if I'm

73
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,890
teaching Python to a beginner they

74
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,960
chances are pretty high that they will

75
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,640
have zero programming experience if

76
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,380
they're coming to an intro to Python

77
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,090
workshop if I'm teaching an intro to

78
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,180
java script workshop a lot of times I

79
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,760
get much more people more people who are

80
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,550
already actually software engineers who

81
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,960
just know that they don't know any

82
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,490
JavaScript but they've had to pretend

83
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,920
like they do or people who have just

84
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,020
kind of fallen into it because you start

85
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,180
writing HTML you start writing the CSS

86
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,490
and then at some point you you know you

87
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,140
want to have like a log in modal so you

88
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,500
have to write JavaScript so how we can

89
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,209
do this is by putting education in our

90
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,670
user groups and that's the lime in the

91
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,020
coconut if you all get that joke anyway

92
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,670
so my top three reasons that you should

93
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,100
bring education to your user group

94
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,300
number one bring in new faces if we

95
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,160
learn something from Boston python is a

96
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,010
ridiculous weight up your numbers just

97
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,610
by hosting the workshop itself you get a

98
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,560
lot more than the people who join for

99
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,810
the workshop it's that kind of Awesome

100
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,520
network effect and the kind of you do

101
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,320
good things and good things happen to

102
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,220
you improve diversity so by making

103
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,680
things open and accessible and being the

104
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,960
kind of place that beginners can go you

105
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,070
essentially make things better for

106
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,350
everyone which kind of has a natural

107
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,570
diversity impact where you invite more

108
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,000
people who don't look like your standard

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,919
user group and then you get a user group

110
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,780
that looks like more like the rest of

111
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,630
the world hopefully and we want to make

112
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,970
JavaScript errs better right so since

113
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,860
code is read a lot more than it's

114
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,900
written my kind

115
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,509
of dream is that by educating all these

116
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,130
JavaScript errs to stop doing the things

117
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,050
that I hate seeing when I read someone

118
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,120
else's JavaScript that one day I'll

119
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,110
never have to read that again so we make

120
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,210
JavaScript better by making JavaScript

121
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,430
ders better and we started a kind of a

122
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,370
grassroots initiative to generally raise

123
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,009
code quality in general so I feel like

124
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,780
we're like generally is like in tech

125
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,889
community we're always interested in the

126
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,600
bleeding edge of things but I'm really

127
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,460
passionate about stepping back and

128
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,500
moving towards the lower level of things

129
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,389
and helping everyone else get themselves

130
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:23,410
up to more of an intermediate level and

131
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,090
there are also totally possibly selfish

132
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,650
reasons that you should bring education

133
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,770
to your user group you can use it to

134
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,590
attract sponsors good will bring us good

135
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,229
well we've noticed that when we do

136
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:37,639
things like bring education our user

137
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,050
group people start throwing money at us

138
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,750
we are not against that so we happily

139
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,849
use it to run more workshops or to bring

140
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,710
speakers from out of town or other happy

141
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,900
things like that you can also run

142
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,490
education programs outside your user

143
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,270
group such as for your interns I'm a big

144
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,930
fan of intern indoctrination that never

145
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,370
ever assume that your intern to know

146
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,740
something running intro workshops for

147
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,320
them I have explained the box model

148
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,169
countless times to people and I'm

149
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:08,479
morning same thing for that don't assume

150
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,849
things be honest and sincere in what

151
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:12,770
you're teaching learning lunchtime

152
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,440
courses for people who are rescaling

153
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,780
from another skill set that kind of

154
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,030
thing so you can bring education this

155
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,289
kind of education program doesn't have

156
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:23,720
to be in a user group so you can also do

157
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,199
it in other context to and teaching

158
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,440
makes you better and stuff teaching

159
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,479
challenges you I've been asked really

160
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,949
interesting questions by people who

161
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,050
didn't know that they were asking an

162
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,060
unusual question that kind of thing like

163
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,760
kind of like deep typing questions can I

164
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,400
do this does this work what happens if I

165
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,530
do that why does that have work that way

166
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,510
things like that that really kind of

167
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,520
happened when you start teaching and

168
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,289
also the side benefit of it you talk in

169
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,060
front of people and you're you know most

170
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,849
people can use to stand to get better at

171
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:59,300
that so how we did it in Philadelphia

172
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,159
and that was this is the workshop we

173
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:01,760
just did

174
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,530
a few weeks ago it was in at church

175
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,940
isn't that cool um so it's actually an

176
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,630
SEO firm that we did a church in philly

177
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,190
and so they have the search church

178
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,710
upstairs that they let us and other

179
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,080
groups use for events sometimes so we

180
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,620
had our workshop in the sanctuary so so

181
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,870
how are kind of how to do run a workshop

182
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,320
so running through these so promote from

183
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,470
within so while yes it can bring in new

184
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,090
members remember that the other goal is

185
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,850
to make everyone better we have a lot of

186
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,620
members of our user group who identify

187
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,200
as beginners or they identify as people

188
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,720
who are retooling and so making sure you

189
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,450
invite them first and that they you tell

190
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,740
them that their priority attendees

191
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,660
because you the reason is because you

192
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,310
want them to get more out of your user

193
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,530
group and so that say they can

194
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,180
understand more of the talks and they're

195
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,620
more interesting to them because they're

196
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,200
more relevant to them so promoting from

197
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,100
within is a really key point advertise

198
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,690
with your curriculum number one part of

199
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,970
that is advertised I've never had a

200
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,740
problem with selling out workshops of

201
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,830
any kind but I also have been told that

202
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm very good at getting the word out

203
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,490
about things by putting up your

204
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,960
curriculum and saying what you're going

205
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,450
to cover especially in JavaScript so

206
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,740
that people know that you aren't going

207
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,590
to talk about Java is generally a good

208
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,290
idea so we advertise with our curriculum

209
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,080
available at least the syllabus of sorts

210
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,030
bring a friend strategy we really like

211
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,280
this to help that kind of like spreading

212
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,729
the network effects so that we say hey

213
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,979
members of the user group if you aren't

214
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,510
interested in if you know we're doing

215
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,070
this workshop thing and you're totally

216
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,140
awesome at javascript but I bet you know

217
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,090
someone at work who totally isn't you

218
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,740
totally shouldn't say that to them but

219
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,060
you should totally invite them to this

220
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,930
workshop and you should say all you know

221
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,600
volunteer so this is how you also get

222
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,700
people who are the great javascript in

223
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,500
your user group already you leverage

224
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,410
them as mentors and coaches my favorite

225
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,150
ratio is one mentor coach 25 students

226
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,160
using the word mentor coach you can also

227
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,080
say teaching assistant I kind of like

228
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,060
coach because it implies like kind of

229
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,710
like going for the team

230
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,960
kind of thing so I kind of call them

231
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,440
coaches it's my friend on laser corner

232
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,710
yeah as my friend Kelly he like blinks

233
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,880
during every picture it's really funny

234
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,930
and some of you all might know Val head

235
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,870
who just moved to Philly but i really

236
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,730
love mentors and coaches you really

237
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,830
can't run any workshop without them they

238
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,930
are so so super important because they

239
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,640
are the people so if I'm talking up here

240
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,920
and doing the lecture type thing and if

241
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,320
you guys went to there was that um the

242
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,120
strap of my guys doing their little one

243
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,530
of their micro talks with the teaching

244
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,420
thing they mentioned about how no one

245
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,070
likes to raise their hand which is

246
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,290
pretty really true and so that's why you

247
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,000
really kind of have to lean on your

248
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,800
coaches as being the people who are

249
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,570
wandering around the room who are being

250
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,280
accessible to the people who are looking

251
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,840
kind of confused and then your coach

252
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,330
says hey do you have any questions that

253
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,550
I can help with and it really works

254
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,090
really well charge your own money or

255
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,940
don't so I love free workshops I love

256
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,820
free workshops but problem is if you

257
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,470
give away something for free a lot of

258
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,840
times people just bail and the problem

259
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,000
with that with offering a low-cost

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,280
educational opportunity that's kind of a

261
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,470
kind of a rare thing and it's a really

262
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,910
important thing and so it's an

263
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,140
opportunity you want people to take

264
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,330
advantage of so we charge a little money

265
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,590
just to add that kind of like little

266
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,810
hurdle so that's like you have to give

267
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,280
us five dollars just so you prove that

268
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,810
you were willing to give us five dollars

269
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,270
and then we'll just use it for food and

270
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,680
the policy is very clear that if for any

271
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,090
reason you don't have to tell like when

272
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,290
I'm organizing workshop you don't have

273
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,640
to tell me any reason that you don't

274
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,650
want to pay you just have to email me

275
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,880
and say hey Pam I want to do the

276
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,870
workshop but I'm not giving you five

277
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,670
dollars and I'm like yeah cool and then

278
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,900
I'll find them up so we personally in

279
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,670
the Philadelphia JavaScript developers

280
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,260
group we charge a little money just to

281
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,880
provide that hurdle but also provide a

282
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,100
path so that if for whatever reason it's

283
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,750
a hardship it doesn't matter to me why

284
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,610
just providing a way for them to get

285
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,790
into the workshop set clear expectations

286
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,980
on all sides make sure your students

287
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,180
know what they're getting into make sure

288
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,440
they know they aren't going to a Jaffa

289
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,170
course and also that makes sure that you

290
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,810
let people know if if you do want to go

291
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,160
into some more advanced topics so you

292
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,840
don't get people who are overwhelmed so

293
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,010
you make sure that they're pointed

294
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,200
toward the more beginner side and you

295
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
also do this kind of expectations deal

296
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,329
free

297
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:32,029
coaches so making sure for one that your

298
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,559
coaches are skilled enough that they'll

299
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,939
be able to answer student questions

300
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:37,639
because I have had people in other

301
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,049
workshops try and sneak into workshops

302
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:40,670
by volunteering as a coach and it's

303
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,649
really not very good because then they

304
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:44,779
actually can't help because they really

305
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,569
should be a student it's great that they

306
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:48,739
love our workshops so much that they

307
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:51,619
want to like sneak in but not really

308
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:54,379
awesome for us on the organizer side but

309
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,730
for the coaches also setting clear

310
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,759
expectations like I always do a little

311
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,369
spiel about the rules of being a coach

312
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:02,899
like never touch someone else's computer

313
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:05,509
without asking so you respect people

314
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:09,019
space things like that and just making

315
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,730
sure that your coaches are on board with

316
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,170
what's going to happen so that they

317
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,569
understand what's expected of them

318
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,839
numbers from this past workshop that we

319
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,269
just ran so we had 30 students six

320
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:22,189
coaches so we got that nice ratio every

321
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:23,480
single one of the students surveyed said

322
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,529
that they would come to another user

323
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:28,339
group meeting awesome and we had 64 new

324
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:31,369
members join our meetup our user group

325
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:34,009
so it was a 25-percent group increase in

326
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:36,799
less than a month and I really like this

327
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,449
is the stuff that our students said

328
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,610
about us my favorite one is actually a

329
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,549
difficulty level one that since remember

330
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:45,040
javascript is a special snowflake

331
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,389
there's plenty of places you can go and

332
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:49,369
run through like Vera turtle equals cat

333
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,139
on the internet and your console or

334
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,790
whatever but there's not a lot of places

335
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,889
that'll really explain to you like this

336
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:56,660
is what the concept of a variable means

337
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,489
and this is why it matters and here's

338
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:00,079
how the object literal is related to the

339
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,410
Dom ability to talk to coaches it's

340
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,669
another favorite that's why one of the

341
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:05,679
reasons why they're so important

342
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,899
election hands-on and pans on is always

343
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:11,629
really important I always do try to talk

344
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:14,480
my maximum kind of talking is about 15

345
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,860
minutes that's like the most all talk

346
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,119
before I let people get on their

347
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:19,549
computers and do stuff it could be just

348
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,809
as like just make something up and be

349
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:22,309
like I want you to make an array and

350
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,639
fill it with animals and then they'll do

351
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,739
it and low you know and you'll find out

352
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:29,149
really quickly if they understand what

353
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,069
an array is and how they populated with

354
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:36,319
uh with Donna so so you can do it too so

355
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,600
how do you run a workshop you people

356
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,279
here who love education and want to

357
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,439
bring it to your user group so you can

358
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:43,070
try it yourself

359
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,840
because i put the curriculum that we

360
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,170
used in philly line at j s for everyone

361
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,280
on my github and so it consists of it's

362
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,040
a reveal presentation like this one so

363
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,630
it's actually so if you know remember

364
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,220
how our veal presentation is like you

365
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,630
can make the detection so the vertical

366
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,730
sections are split like that and so

367
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,160
their components so theoretically when I

368
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,010
do it is 30 minutes per component once

369
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,450
you in like that's including interactive

370
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,240
time that's not just talking time so

371
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,640
coming over these are the very very

372
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,140
basic JavaScript fundamentals that we go

373
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,330
over big thing in front of mel's course

374
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,240
be really kind and sincere don't assume

375
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,290
that anyone knows everything the reason

376
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,880
they're in your workshop is because they

377
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,500
want you to explain it to them kindly

378
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,790
and with sincerity so go slowly be kind

379
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,340
and honestly and sincerely explain

380
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,210
things like what an object literal is so

381
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,280
some tips for you guys if you're

382
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,900
interested in this thang I promised a

383
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,700
lot in my in my talk so I'm running

384
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,050
through a lot so how I teach and coach

385
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,900
watch the room so like for example right

386
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,820
now this is late in the day so this is

387
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,990
really difficult because a lot of you

388
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,670
are looking at your computers so if I

389
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,840
were teaching this that's a class I

390
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,570
would probably make you all do something

391
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,150
so and also when you're teaching and

392
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,860
coaching listen more than you talk it's

393
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,420
definitely obviously important for a

394
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,910
coach but a lot of people we get so

395
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,010
excited that we want to talk a lot but

396
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,800
we really need to not and let them tell

397
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,530
us what's going on seriously by

398
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,030
listening more than you talk you prevent

399
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,130
a lot of confusion and you help solve

400
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,050
any confusions for the student a lot

401
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,240
faster so asking for clarification

402
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,970
rather than doing some exposition is

403
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,890
generally what you want to do so give

404
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,240
space the thing about don't touch the

405
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,120
keyboard that's physical space also give

406
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,430
kind of emotional space so if someone

407
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,380
I've seem like it's hard and remember

408
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,210
that these are adults so like the thing

409
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,740
about teaching adults is like they don't

410
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,420
have to be there and they can bail at

411
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,340
any time but theoretically they came

412
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,900
because they want to be there so your

413
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,520
job is to kind of help them want to be

414
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,910
there if that makes sense so given an

415
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,560
emotional space like if they are getting

416
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,270
frustrated and like see people get like

417
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,570
really upset and don't say things

418
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,660
like you're doing fine that seems like

419
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,910
an awesome thing to say not something to

420
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,430
say because then their head goes oh my

421
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,840
god I'm a terrible person I'll never

422
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,690
ever know JavaScript saying things like

423
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,360
well tell me more about it have we

424
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,920
looked at this part of it do you want to

425
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,240
look at that part of it with that help

426
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,430
like be more like that and like

427
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,320
recognizing the problem rather than

428
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,900
trying to sidestep the problem and

429
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,780
embrace your style so this is one of the

430
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,190
tips that someone gave me about when I

431
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,860
started teaching is that if you want to

432
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,930
do all your lectures with cat pictures

433
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,500
awesome um kind of just embracing the

434
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,840
way you want to talk because when you

435
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,270
teach especially if you're comfortable

436
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,800
it helps the people in front of you be

437
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,170
comfortable they can feel if you're

438
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,910
nervous and if you just run I want to

439
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,280
run away then that might that make them

440
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,700
feel that way too but you can't do it

441
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,290
wrong or you will find out very quickly

442
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,650
if you are because they will leave

443
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,270
that's not the nice way to say it but

444
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,050
that's true so I have not always been

445
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,700
the best teacher and I've had people get

446
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,170
really frustrated and so that I figured

447
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,699
it out and then I figured out what I was

448
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,120
doing wrong so that's just kind of a

449
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,680
caution in case it sounds like a lot to

450
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,140
do but really like giving you a try and

451
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,270
then you can figure it out is the way to

452
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,990
go so one of my favorite things that the

453
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,390
Boston Python workshop says is they say

454
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,790
when when we're teaching a workshop like

455
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,550
well and filius a PI star workshop but

456
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,280
we use Boston Python curriculum but we

457
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,410
say today is not as important as

458
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,600
tomorrow today is not as important to us

459
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,550
tomorrow so the workshop is not as

460
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,050
important as the day after in the day

461
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,690
after that whatever you do when you're

462
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,730
learning something doesn't matter if you

463
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,660
don't use it so one of the best things

464
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,090
you can do is that's why having these

465
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,710
things in a user group is really great

466
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,450
because you already have and an

467
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,000
organization to attach things onto so

468
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,890
the classic user group meeting with

469
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,710
talks we generally try to have a more we

470
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,810
usually we do talk meetings every other

471
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,910
month and philly and we have two talks

472
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,280
one talks more like a kind of intro talk

473
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,780
it might be an intro to certain

474
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,130
technology and the other one's a little

475
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,780
bit more advanced that's kind of help me

476
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,779
run it

477
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:11,969
having lightning talks we also combine

478
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:13,669
our lightning talks with project nice

479
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:17,070
project nights are what some people call

480
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,019
hack nights we call them project nights

481
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:20,039
because they make them more accessible

482
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,379
to everyone a lot of people have your

483
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:24,059
new to development especially don't

484
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,379
really understand the idea of a hacker

485
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:28,169
and like they think of like you know the

486
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:31,049
you know black screen max breaking into

487
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,989
the Department of Defense cut thing they

488
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,219
don't really get that you know hackers

489
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:38,129
people working on things so we do

490
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:40,049
project night and lightning talks for us

491
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,460
our lightning talks 45 minutes some

492
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,589
people do longer lightning talks I talks

493
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,629
are a great way to get your new members

494
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:48,809
to start talking to people quickly I've

495
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:50,369
even had workshop attendees give a

496
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:51,629
lightning talk at the next session

497
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:53,489
because they just want to talk about a

498
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:55,529
problem they solved using something cool

499
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,389
that they learn and it will be valuable

500
00:18:57,389 --> 00:18:59,729
to someone there and no matter what it's

501
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:01,710
only five minutes so it's a really

502
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,269
accessible way for people to get started

503
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,149
and book clubs or providing other ways

504
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:07,440
for people to get in contact with each

505
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,690
other whatever works for your group we

506
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,999
lean on meetup com a lot it works for us

507
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,259
you use what works for you so summary is

508
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,229
put your education into your user group

509
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:21,089
because by doing that hopefully we can

510
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:22,409
make a better community in order to make

511
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:23,999
a better JavaScript making better

512
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,889
JavaScript errs and bring the joy to the

513
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:40,950
masses through education thank you
