1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,539

so Angeline I gave a great introduction

2
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,369
to web confidence and I'm just going to

3
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,560
extend on that and talk about how we can

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,170
use it with sees his favorite spec that

5
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,169
you like and before I go forward with

6
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:30,740
web competence I wanted to I I had an

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,360
incident that I thought would be a good

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,160
representation or a metaphor for what

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,460
web development is so this is my iphone

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,020
the back of my iphone there is something

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,149
wrong with it if you are in front you

12
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,920
kind of can see there's something wrong

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,379
it's not the stickers of scowling

14
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,510
bunnies which are playing football and

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,490
this is exactly how I'd look if you

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,470
asked me to play football but there is a

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,750
cellophane tape on it which doesn't look

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,150
too bad it's a cellophane tape but if

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,380
you look at the front you would notice

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,900
it's all shattered and this class is

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,950
held together by the cellophane tape and

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,570
I thought this was a good metaphor for

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,640
web development because even though it's

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,040
it's it's shouted I can still use it

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,060
like it still works so in the way the

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,189
way the web is is is it's completely

27
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:20,380
unstructured and everything you do is

28
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,780
through this narrow view of this kind of

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,049
a shattered glass and it always has you

30
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:28,880
make mistakes like there's no default

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,579
way to not make mistakes and there's

32
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,560
always conflicts and there's always

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,069
things messing up and it's almost like

34
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:40,219
you know you are in to go into a room a

35
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,780
room full of diamonds and shattered

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,939
glass and you're supposed to pick those

37
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,159
diamonds off without making sure you

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,439
don't bleed to death while stepping on

39
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,959
toes shattered glass but down with web

40
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,719
confidence and I think what you get now

41
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,539
with web components is a way to get a

42
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,789
dustbin to sweep off the brick broken

43
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,770
glass and then you know you make your

44
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,389
merry way around the room get the

45
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,009
diamonds as and when you feel like it or

46
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,319
in the case of my iphone it would be the

47
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,999
thirty dollar screen replacement that

48
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,520
you would hopefully get to replace your

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,470
iphone screen with and start using the

50
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,709
iphone as it was before so with that

51
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,319
introduction to web components first

52
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,300
thing that you should know is can I use

53
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,269
is definitely no please do not use it

54
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:27,409
ever for now but please experiment with

55
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:28,940
it like can i experiment yes

56
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,160
always please do that and what you

57
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,470
should be doing is experiment with it

58
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,990
give feedback to the speculators maybe

59
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,790
write something with it see how your

60
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,470
existing competence can port over to

61
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,630
this web conference back and basically

62
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,000
make sure that it does not suck because

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,220
a lot of current web api is sucked big

64
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,920
time so we don't want to replicate that

65
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,990
kind of error again with something as

66
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,780
big and as encompassing as web component

67
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,310
specifications so first thing to notice

68
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,620
it's chrome only and it's not even like

69
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,510
a web kid only thing it's a chrome only

70
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,000
thing it's also very hard to debug

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,930
because especially because you have

72
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,060
separating concerns that is different

73
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,650
components in different pages and

74
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,110
different files so if you're still

75
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,910
interested the way you would go forward

76
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,600
is enable flags in Chrome Canary so

77
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,240
first there's a flag called experimental

78
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,310
support for WebKit experiments and that

79
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,170
would give you shadow Dom that would

80
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,450
give you CSS variables that will give

81
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,730
you CSIS regions and there's also

82
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,910
another flag for CSIS shaders which I'll

83
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,459
talk about so enabling these two flags

84
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:35,720
will give you everything that you need

85
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,570
to follow along with this talk and then

86
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,940
if you are doing tellapur tools you do

87
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,430
want to you know be sane so to do that

88
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,890
you have to enable show shadow DOM and

89
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,890
then Angelina talked about the polyfill

90
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,570
that we'll be using and this is the

91
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,340
polyfill that exactly replicates the

92
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,670
spec that encompasses well the bunch of

93
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,550
specs that composes the web components

94
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,070
specifications and so it has all the

95
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,720
api's and everything that is necessary

96
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,410
to start using the spec at least as an

97
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,050
experiment so the essentials of web

98
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,400
components that are like for

99
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,350
specifications that form the part of the

100
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,870
web competence spec and there's one that

101
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,700
I'm never gonna talk about because I

102
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,100
completely hate it and it's called the

103
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,990
decorators please never talk of it again

104
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,490
and hopefully if you're giving feedback

105
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,590
tell them that you hate it too but if

106
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,390
you really like it or if you won't find

107
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,860
out more about it just google for

108
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,240
decorators web components you'll find

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,000
information about it but the first thing

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,340
that's part of the web conference pack

111
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,470
is the shadow DOM and you've heard

112
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,030
enough of it so I'm not going to bother

113
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,800
telling you what it is

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,490
then you have the custom elements and

115
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,690
one thing to notice all of these

116
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,430
specifications can be used on their own

117
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,110
like you don't have to use them all

118
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,220
together you can use them separately

119
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,919
they all have their own benefits so the

120
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,690
way you'd use a custom element is you

121
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,909
have an element and then you would

122
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:01,580
extend a native HTML tag that most

123
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,740
closely matches the custom element that

124
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,449
you're going to use and then you have a

125
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,129
name and then you put a bunch of HTML

126
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:11,599
CSS script whatnot so and the way you

127
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:14,479
would use it is you will have this same

128
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,090
HTML tag that you used in the extent

129
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,060
attribute value and then say is that

130
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,639
custom element and you can't use so here

131
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,009
in this example I have a button so in

132
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:32,960
the definition I had where it oh so in

133
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,210
the definition I had extends button so i

134
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,340
have to use a button tie here I can't

135
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,840
use the div or a span or anything like

136
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,090
that so then you have templates so

137
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,409
templates again can be used on their own

138
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,779
so I'd use a template tag and then you'd

139
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,370
put content within the content tagged

140
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,490
and as Angelina said you use the Select

141
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,409
attribute to select the kind of content

142
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,690
that will form the part of the template

143
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,469
so let's look at an example so this is

144
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:03,710
example of how web components would work

145
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,169
so if you notice the mark up you have

146
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:08,419
just two buttons and they say click me

147
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,240
click me the same but one of the buttons

148
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,039
has the east attribute of one doesn't

149
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,979
and the nature of HTML buttons is that

150
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,110
they do nothing until you associate an

151
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,500
action with them so here it appears like

152
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,180
they have both buttons which in which

153
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,949
case they should both do nothing like

154
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:27,080
when I click on this click me nothing

155
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,120
happens which is rather that's exactly

156
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,520
how what you look like but in this click

157
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,199
me you notice first of all there's an

158
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,479
ascii character which typically you

159
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,430
would not expect to have but it's a

160
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,860
custom element so when I click it I have

161
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,039
a statement stuff you know it's a good

162
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,090
stress release but so the reason why we

163
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,219
do this is how it happens is first you

164
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,529
have the link rel is equal to components

165
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,690
and I have the components in this file

166
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,630
so if you go to that

167
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:01,430
opponent I have an element and then I

168
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,470
have name and then I have the template

169
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,480
and whatever us within the template

170
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,360
becomes part of that new instance of

171
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,650
that new custom element that just

172
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,130
created and I have a span we look into

173
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,540
the variable a little bit later then i

174
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,630
have that ascii character and then again

175
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,150
where I'm putting this content and then

176
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,290
this is the script that's getting

177
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,420
triggered if you notice I don't just

178
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,790
simply have this doggone click is equal

179
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,980
to function that will not fly because

180
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,410
this script least run every time that

181
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,420
shadow Dom has been instantiated so

182
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,120
there's a lifecycle API that you can use

183
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,760
and then you can save which functions

184
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,230
need to be executed as soon as the

185
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,790
shadow DOM is created so I have a

186
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,530
created and then I have a function that

187
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,420
I'm executing and that's what is

188
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,900
triggering the consulted walk statements

189
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,720
so let's look at how the web components

190
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,810
work with other specs that we love

191
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,360
especially for me I really like regions

192
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,540
regions is a new CSS specification that

193
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,270
allows you to flow content respective of

194
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,460
the document source order so you may

195
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,570
have a headphone on the top and then if

196
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,120
you want if you use regions you can

197
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,760
display the h1 at the bottom or wherever

198
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,610
you like and the way this would work is

199
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,920
you would have a bunch of selectors and

200
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,510
you would say the content of those

201
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,450
selectors would be part of what is known

202
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,760
as named flow and then you have another

203
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,130
bunch of selectors and you would then

204
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,860
declare those selectors to be containers

205
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,320
for that named flow and so the syntax

206
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
would look like so you'll have the

207
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,300
selector and then you'll say flow into

208
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,919
and then you have a named flow called

209
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,840
region for here and then you'll have the

210
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,340
container selectors and then you'll say

211
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,490
flow from and it'll just display the

212
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,680
content from that name flow so what

213
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,990
happens is as soon as you say flow into

214
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,080
the that selector becomes empty like

215
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,820
it's almost like it's displaying on and

216
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,310
then the containers if they already had

217
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,350
content that will not be displayed any

218
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,790
more it will only display the content

219
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:09,950
from that named flow so here is how

220
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,820
a shadow Dom would sorry a region would

221
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,440
look like this is without the shadow Dom

222
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,500
let's look at so you have 80 this is

223
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,780
bitch and I'm sorry so this is without

224
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,000
the shadow Dom if you notice you have

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,970
the content as a section and that all

226
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,970
the paragraph elements have the text and

227
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,070
then I have a layout and if you notice I

228
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,610
have a WebKit flow into and I have a

229
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,800
flow called point flow does anyone know

230
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,490
what point this is what wow I was

231
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,140
expecting Angus to answer for the family

232
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,390
someone else's answering this I didn't

233
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,160
know you guys were all literature majors

234
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,290
but anyway so this is the point called

235
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,900
The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe so you have

236
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,140
a flow into so you can also debug this

237
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,240
there's an experimental mode to debug

238
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,160
regions and so you'll see all the name

239
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,800
flows and then you'll have the content

240
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,590
that is in that flow and the region's

241
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,800
that's that it will be displayed in so a

242
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,660
concern with this region spec is that if

243
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,400
you have a browser that does not support

244
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,620
regions then you'll have the layout

245
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,650
below the content just displayed with

246
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,150
that styles that you've used for that

247
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,450
layout and some purists may not like

248
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,520
having all these empty divs you know you

249
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,650
want it to be as semantic as possible

250
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,230
and whatnot so there's a way you can

251
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,690
work with this with read with the shadow

252
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,880
DOM and the web component stuff is that

253
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,550
hide all the layout stuff into the web

254
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,490
the competent are using and only have

255
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,570
the content be part of that element so

256
00:10:52,570 --> 00:11:00,530
here is it with shadow DOM and so here

257
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,470
you notice there's only the P elements

258
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,760
nothing else there's no layout anymore

259
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,280
so but it still renders in the same way

260
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,890
it still has that flow going through and

261
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,440
the way that happens is you have on the

262
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,610
network you have the region's and I have

263
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,190
the layout section here

264
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,230
and one thing to note is that even

265
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,320
though I'm using regions within a

266
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,330
specific component I'm still using the

267
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,430
styles from the parent and the way I

268
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,340
would do this is as soon as i

269
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,200
instantiate that shadow Dom I would make

270
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,910
sure that i'm applying author styles so

271
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,460
that it flows the Styles apply from the

272
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:47,840
parent to the shadow Dom itself so let's

273
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,070
look at the other specs so the other

274
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,900
spec that's recently out is called the

275
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,480
variables it's a very wrong name for the

276
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,460
spec because it's actually just custom

277
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,580
CSS property and at best it'll have a

278
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,770
value like a string fragment so it's

279
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,480
just a string fragment that you can use

280
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,420
anywhere and the way it should work is

281
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,510
you have a you have a selector and then

282
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,940
you have a var prefix and the property

283
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,980
name and then the value that you'll be

284
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,530
using the property and then the way you

285
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,040
use it is select use another selector

286
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,380
and then you'd set a normal CSS property

287
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,120
with a var function and pass the

288
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,100
parameter as the property name that you

289
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,590
just used and one thing to note is that

290
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,700
this is the variables are also scope to

291
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,500
the specificity of the selector where

292
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,630
you first define them so in this case

293
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,850
you have the section and then you have

294
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,770
the VAR my property so if you're using

295
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,290
if you're trying to get the value of my

296
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,570
property in the body selector it will be

297
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,820
undefined so that's something that is

298
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,040
not immediately obvious to you and if

299
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,760
you have if you cringe at the syntax I

300
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,430
do too but there's no way out this is

301
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,720
what this is working group has decided

302
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,370
will be the syntax for CSS variables so

303
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,190
here is if you realize we have this

304
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,140
variable here as the value for this

305
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,390
background let's set it and see how that

306
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:23,990
so i'll put miners WebKit and then it

307
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,210
gets applied and now CSS variables are

308
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,310
pretty important to the web components

309
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,060
because essentially i said the styles do

310
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,810
not quite flow into so

311
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,840
if you have a shell if you have a span

312
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,270
if you want to style a span of the

313
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,310
children of the content that go into the

314
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,080
shadow Dom you can't do that from within

315
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,600
the component itself you need to do it

316
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,000
from the parent and that's not sometimes

317
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,220
easy and you may want to you know that

318
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,779
that kind of separation is kind of hard

319
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:55,029
to get so you may want to pass on these

320
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:57,850
parameters as values by using CSS

321
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,240
variables and style your shadow Dom

322
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,480
components using those variables so the

323
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,550
last speck I would like to talk about

324
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,730
our custom filters how many of you know

325
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,370
about shaders Wow a lot of people as

326
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,190
much more than I expected so the shaders

327
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,960
is something that we use in typically in

328
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,480
WebGL and what they would do is they

329
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,060
just apply some textures on to your web

330
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,589
GL model and then render it on a canvas

331
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,100
element but what Kristin filters does is

332
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,860
to do the exact same thing but on HTML

333
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,200
elements and so you can have different

334
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,420
kinds of effects but so you can have

335
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,520
textures and you could have some sort of

336
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,950
wobbly effect and all of that on your HD

337
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,589
ml element and this is all part of a

338
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,510
specification called the filter effects

339
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,220
and filter effects specification

340
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,990
provides some native filter effects as

341
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,060
well so those native filter effects

342
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,730
could be like blur sepia gray scale and

343
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,650
those are all available in chrome stable

344
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,290
and Safari 6 but this custom filters is

345
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,940
only available in Chrome Canary for now

346
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,060
and there's also a filter lab that's

347
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,000
that's like a tool to help you edit

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,160
shaders and see how they apply on HTML

349
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,730
elements but the syntax for how that

350
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,290
works is that you will have a selector

351
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,850
and then you'll have a filter property

352
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,280
and then you'll have a function called

353
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,140
custom and then you cause the URL for

354
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,000
the shader and then the parameters for

355
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,420
that shader itself and so the what the

356
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,430
browser will do is then it will select

357
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,320
all elements that match that particular

358
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,839
selector and then render it off screen

359
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,020
and make a model of it and then have a

360
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,870
lot of vertices and and it will then

361
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,380
apply those shaders to that model and

362
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,209
then finally render it on screen again

363
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,499
so the thing is after

364
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:50,389
it's all rendered it's still live text

365
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:51,979
so it means you can still select the

366
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:56,389
text and do things with the text so

367
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,479
let's look at how this would work so

368
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:04,719
this is a let me extend it so this is a

369
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:07,609
not sure if you can see there's there's

370
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:10,069
a subtle fabric light effect that you

371
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,789
can see if you hover on it and this is

372
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,219
the photo of dementia Glasgow who is the

373
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:19,939
primary a leading person doing the web

374
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:23,659
conference back so that this is how we

375
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:27,679
have the content so we have left content

376
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,169
we have right content and then look at

377
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:36,259
the component itself so i have banner i

378
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,419
have the filter that's being applied and

379
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:40,339
then i have a transition I could have

380
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:41,959
done an animation but there's a bog and

381
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,279
I'll come to that a little bit later and

382
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,449
then i have the content select and then

383
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:50,239
i select the left container the left

384
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,589
contain the right content and so on so

385
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:55,399
that's pretty trivial so uh the other

386
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,809
thing i want to show is that you can

387
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,749
reuse new you know like reuse the same

388
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:02,179
confident but apply different content to

389
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:04,610
it so you'll have h to class is equal to

390
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,259
left content so as long as you have the

391
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,350
same class name you're safe so as if the

392
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,970
h2 as a left content that will be

393
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,079
displayed which is what is being

394
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,600
displayed on the left and same with the

395
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,029
right content so if you notice our

396
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:21,069
component does not have it only renters

397
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:25,759
let's look at the components elf so it

398
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,580
it own where is mine yeah there you go

399
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,669
so it only renders content that is off

400
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:34,700
certain class names it does not render

401
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,399
any other content so if you look here in

402
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:40,279
this example there is a p class is equal

403
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,200
to M is normal or whatever that you

404
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,080
will see on the web and that will not be

405
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,539
rendered on the screen because you only

406
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:49,399
are scoping the content to be rendered

407
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:51,200
to the but specific class names that you

408
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,779
want so if the users are the authors

409
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:57,200
provide you like a bunch of content you

410
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,730
can make sure that you can ignore them

411
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,740
and not render it at all

412
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,770
and not just that you can also apply a

413
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,940
you know different components so here in

414
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:20,940
this case i have i have banner instant

415
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:31,860
badass a better accordion wait accordion

416
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,679
and i have the variable height set to

417
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,620
New York antenna let's look at how so

418
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,900
this is I'm just using accordance the

419
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,210
same content but I just changed it to a

420
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,410
different component and now it looks

421
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,080
like it's a Cardian or whatever whatever

422
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,370
that's supposed to be so it's like a

423
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,440
hero control so depending on what

424
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,510
component you use you can just reuse the

425
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,730
same content but just make it displayed

426
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,960
differently you can even have this

427
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,420
display as an SVG or anything that you

428
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,670
like so it so you can pass on the same

429
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,650
content but then the component will

430
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,420
decide how it will render or even how it

431
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,740
will interact so there are some things

432
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,760
that you should keep in mind though and

433
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,580
that's what I talked about so as Angela

434
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,220
said the shadow Dom sup little sub 3

435
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,960
stars no apply to the elements children

436
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,150
so I want to show how that how that

437
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,580
manifests itself if you look at the

438
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,860
button here so now I have a new span

439
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,990
within that button so this span will

440
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,270
become part of the content for the

441
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,160
template that we are using so here is

442
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,740
the template that we are using so we

443
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,809
have style and then you have content now

444
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:42,150
that span will be within this content

445
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,570
attack but I have this style here then

446
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,970
so I have spanned background red and it

447
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,100
should ideally apply right because I

448
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,190
have the span it should it's part of the

449
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,890
child know logically that makes sense

450
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,110
except the spec says no that won't

451
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,450
happen so the only way you can do that

452
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,280
is if I actually apply this here and I

453
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,380
will see that it works now because it's

454
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,800
the child element of the the button

455
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,169
itself and not part of the shadow Dom so

456
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,060
you have to be aware of that

457
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,330
and then there are still bugs about

458
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,070
style scoping implementations which is

459
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,980
why I couldn't do fancy custom filters

460
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,190
on animation for for keyframe animations

461
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,040
and then a shockingly font face is not

462
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,570
supported so you can't use your terrible

463
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,570
ones to showcase how awesome web

464
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:40,370
components are and I would definitely

465
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,550
have you read the explainer and that

466
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,400
link is valid as of yesterday it's just

467
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,120
get free PO and just go to that location

468
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,650
and look for the tip and make sure

469
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,300
you're reading the latest explainer and

470
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,310
I took about a few months to understand

471
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,770
what is all this is about and the

472
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,120
explanation explainer is very

473
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,910
interesting too contrary to how usually

474
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,490
specs are and there's also a Google+

475
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,430
account for web components and it is a

476
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,770
good job of showcasing what other people

477
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,720
are saying or doing with respect to web

478
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,520
prominence and then Dimitri glazkov

479
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,400
himself has a Twitter account and he's

480
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,010
also on google+ and there are a bunch of

481
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,960
people walking on the web component

482
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,400
specifications and they're all very

483
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,230
responsive and they are actively seeking

484
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,260
your feedback so please do give them

485
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,330
feedback and make sure it does not end

486
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,880
up as maybe the video API so that's all

487
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,400
I have my slides are up on nipple in /

488
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,340
dias con for you but before I go I just

489
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,780
wanted to up you know pitch it even that

490
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,940
we are organizing with w3c colchester

491
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,550
way forward where hackers and spectators

492
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,960
come together to write tests to make

493
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,480
sure that browsers are not buggy when

494
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,340
they claim to implement something so if

495
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,740
you are about to offer and you live near

496
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,170
Paris and you're free that we can please

497
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,960
come and join us so that's all I have

498
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:23,220
thanks

499
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,090
how does the shadow Dom work work with

500
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,740
accessibility if at all um i have no

501
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,120
idea right now i don't think it's even

502
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,040
in the eye if there is no such i don't

503
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,270
know if there's accessibility API

504
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,430
implemented already for shadow Dom I

505
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,420
don't think it is but for now if you the

506
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,460
east attribute is ignored so the screen

507
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,050
readers will typically just read the

508
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,300
content of within that element so if you

509
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,620
have no content that nothing will be

510
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,290
read I don't think it'll be it's not

511
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,610
accessible unless you have contained

512
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,920
within that element for now but i don't

513
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,630
but i am sure it will improve as soon as

514
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,030
there's more shadow Dom support but I

515
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,590
think with respect to video form

516
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,110
controls there might be a P is already

517
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,030
associated because I'm pretty sure

518
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,810
that's implemented in Chrome but that's

519
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,090
only for native implementations of the

520
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,190
shadow Dom before the video chrome and

521
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,000
stuff like that hey yeah thanks thanks

522
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,900
for your talk just one question how is

523
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,380
it with with events happening inside of

524
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,740
the shadow roots are they bubbling up to

525
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,840
the to the normal down to the outer

526
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,910
window or just are they also

527
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,520
encapsulated in the taro root typically

528
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,650
they are mostly encapsulated Dimitri

529
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,110
Glasgow has a recent post on how they

530
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,330
recently solve the problem how to expose

531
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,530
the events selectively to the parent

532
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,330
dumb and I'm not quite sure on the

533
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,190
specifics but you should go read his

534
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:59,120
post on that okay thank you very much do
