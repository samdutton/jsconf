1
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,410

hi everyone as you said my name is

2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,510
Raquel Bellas I'm rockbot on all of the

3
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,750
things now let me just get a general

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,849
survey of the area how many of you have

5
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:27,810
ever used NPM okay excellent how many of

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,449
you have used the NPM website in the

7
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,500
last month last week last day use it

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,900
multiple times a day okay yeah the

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,670
numbers are dwindling that's okay one

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,989
day we'll get you using it all the time

11
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,000
forever and ever will be like the next

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,110
state no we won't okay now most of my

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,610
colleagues when they talk about NPM

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,650
they'll talk about the CLI they'll talk

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,600
about the registry but today you're all

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,670
y'all are in luck because I'm going to

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,449
talk about the website so my goal is to

18
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,339
kind of give you an overview of NPM in

19
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:03,989
general then talk about the history of

20
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,489
the website and then I want to talk

21
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,869
about the lessons that we have learned

22
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,690
in the process of building the website

23
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,590
and that I think is going to be the

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,990
coolest take away all right so NPM in

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,920
general fun fact npm does not actually

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,189
stand for node package manager when i've

27
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,799
actually recreated it it was literally

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,590
just a three letter word and p.m. you

29
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,590
could say that it has no prescribed

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,090
meaning okay only pun I promise okay

31
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,000
that said it is actually a package

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,249
manager for javascript though even that

33
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:40,649
is a little bit misleading because there

34
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:45,509
are over 350,000 packages on NPM right

35
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,539
now and many of them while many of them

36
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,939
are javascript-based there are ones with

37
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,240
CSS in them and ones with go and rest

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,829
and there's even a little bit of C++ in

39
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,109
there so really it's just a package

40
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:59,999
manager I like to think it's pretty cool

41
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:03,749
and so you may know that it started out

42
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,149
as an open source project node came

43
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,220
around in 2009 and that was really great

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,289
and people wanted to share code but they

45
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,120
wanted to really use it as like modules

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,940
and add those little modules into their

47
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,459
websites or their applications and so

48
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,020
Isaac schluter our CEO created NPM

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,820
as you know just a kind of cool thing

50
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,850
and that was fantastic except something

51
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,310
interesting happened people started

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,890
using node a lot and with it they

53
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,830
started using NPM a lot this is the

54
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,520
graph of people installing node modules

55
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,710
in over the course of the first four

56
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,770
years of n PM's existence but not only

57
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,950
were they using NPM they were also

58
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,200
really contributing to the NPM ecosystem

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,660
right this is exponential like this is

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,420
not what you expect in general now there

61
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,110
was a dark period at the end of 2013 in

62
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,880
those days we call the dark period

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,000
because NPM kept going down how many of

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,790
you used NPM in 2013 do you remember

65
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,330
those days they're kind of dark at

66
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,850
people were relying on node and NPM in

67
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,070
production and then all of a sudden they

68
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,860
couldn't use NPM because the growth was

69
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,200
so exponential and so massive that this

70
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,300
tiny open source project could not

71
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,040
handle the load there was no dedicated

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,400
people no real dedicated servers so it

73
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,150
went dark a lot at that point Isaac made

74
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,520
the decision to turn NPM into a company

75
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,440
because we wanted to be able to create

76
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,200
products and services to give real user

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,450
value to the point where you wanted to

78
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,340
pay money so that we could keep the

79
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,140
registry up and running and we could pay

80
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,970
people to keep the edge of the registry

81
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,330
up and running so that's how NPM kind of

82
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,560
started and in 2014 I became the first

83
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,200
employee of NPM and the entire existence

84
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,480
of my time a 10pm has been focused on

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,700
the website so let's go a little bit

86
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,420
back in time at the very first version

87
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,080
of the NPM website is from jun 2010 and

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,600
here's what it looked like it was just a

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,340
little landing page there's not much

90
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,209
here it's just a little like hey there's

91
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,970
this thing called NPM go to the github

92
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,290
repo you'll find out more information

93
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,940
there great six months later though

94
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,930
there's a little bit more information

95
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,850
again it's still really more of a

96
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,400
landing page but one really fun addition

97
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,370
is this idea of searching for packages

98
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,080
this is what the search looked like

99
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,300
anybody who uses its back then this is

100
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,379
like a nostalgia static sort of moment

101
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,569
this was a couch app created by michael

102
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,300
rogers and when you only have like a few

103
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,090
hundred packages this is fine this is

104
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,870
totally fine it was in fact it was so

105
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,409
fine it worked for 18 months and then

106
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:00,069
something really big happened npm became

107
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,259
packaged with node I'm all that in of

108
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:03,789
itself or the website is not that big of

109
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:06,250
a deal it does actually mean that there

110
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,440
are more users which means more user

111
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,060
growth and a few months after that the

112
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,789
first real community was was born on the

113
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:18,610
NPM website this really allows us to not

114
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,009
only search packages but to start seeing

115
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:22,599
people's profiles and start getting

116
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,449
statistics about about packages and

117
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,940
who's building stuff and and how many

118
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,800
people are downloading it and it was so

119
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,199
cool now the thing about the search

120
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,969
though is that the number of packages

121
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:36,550
started to skyrocket and Michael's

122
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,810
little couch app didn't quite work

123
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,599
anymore and so it actually turned out

124
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,729
that you would go to the little search

125
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:45,279
input and it would just take you to

126
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,900
google was like forget it we're not be

127
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,879
able to do this but eventually somebody

128
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,819
added an elastic search engine and we

129
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:55,509
had really really basic search I'm sad

130
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,400
to say that this is still the exact same

131
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,690
elastic search engine that we're using

132
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,930
on NPM Jess calm right now that's why

133
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,789
the search sucks we're working on it I

134
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:08,560
promise okay great so after that point

135
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,490
for the next two and a half years we

136
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,229
started this company we started really

137
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:15,759
getting into the website but something

138
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,520
very very very important really

139
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,690
important happened in jun 2014 we got a

140
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,229
wombat we got our first mascot and this

141
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,379
is our really our only mascot but it's

142
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,419
really cute and cuddly and a lot of

143
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,009
people ask me what is the origin of the

144
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,319
wombat where does this come from now if

145
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,310
you'll allow me a moment of

146
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,860
embarrassment this is the real story of

147
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,279
why we have a wombat as our mascot turns

148
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,820
out that there was an intern who

149
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,220
who was complaining one day about slow

150
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,010
internet and I don't I have no idea what

151
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,730
compelled me I have no clue at all but

152
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,680
basically here's what I said the

153
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,390
internet is a series of tubes which we

154
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,970
all know as a fact sometimes things get

155
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,300
clogged and sometimes there is a leak

156
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,880
because tubes can be broken there is no

157
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,400
fix except to release a pack of wombats

158
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,040
with pickaxes in little helmets and

159
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,760
bright orange vests for safety I have no

160
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,380
idea where this came from it just came

161
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,790
out of nowhere now CJ Silverio who

162
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,100
started a week after me chief chimes in

163
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,830
with wombat developers Union for the win

164
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,320
I don't know where that came from either

165
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,000
but see here's the fun thing if you take

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,880
the npm logo and you invert it it's wdu

167
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,490
so boom of course obviously we should be

168
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,950
the wombats developer Union so if you

169
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,170
love our wombat shout out to its John Q

170
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,960
on Twitter because I just one day was

171
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,570
like okay hey Twitter who can draw me a

172
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,470

173
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,900
in and just drew his cute little thing

174
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,180
and we were like done it's over game

175
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,610
over we love our little wombat this is

176
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,250
the greatest so now you all know the

177
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,000
story back to the website okay so two

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,060
and a half years go by and uh actually

179
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,040
not to enough yours the next several

180
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,190
years later uh from the last time we saw

181
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:22,590
our website we spent time and we we put

182
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,480
out a brand new website we were really

183
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,640
focused now now that the community was

184
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,270
growing so much our major focus was to

185
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,190
build a website centered around the

186
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,020
community we wanted to make it as easy

187
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,240
as possible to find good packages to

188
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,890
connect with others and just give you a

189
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,590
really nice beautiful experience I love

190
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,120
the old website but I like this one

191
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,750
better now in the process we also

192
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,520
changed a whole bunch of backend stuff

193
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,630
and I'm going to dive into that in a

194
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,170
moment so here's where we are today over

195
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,990
the last 18 months we have released

196
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,800
three products on our website and it's

197
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,350
really important for us to

198
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,750
help tell you what they are so we've got

199
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,600
marketing pages now and we are really

200
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,980
just trying to push these products and

201
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,600
services because the last thing we ever

202
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,150
want ever again is for you to not be

203
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,280
able to depend on NPM when you're doing

204
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,320
your installs it's really important that

205
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,440
those servers do exactly what you want

206
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,650
so we got to sell you stuff okay great

207
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,170
news users are increasing on the website

208
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,290
this is great but did you know that

209
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,220
we're doing with the team of three

210
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,380
there's only three of us working on the

211
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,630
web team a 10pm there's only 24 of us a

212
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,620
10pm entirely so there's all y'all and

213
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,970
then there's just a couple of less so

214
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,960
but we all work together and that's

215
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,060
really important ok let's get into the

216
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,020
nitty-gritty meaty bits so over the

217
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,000
course of the last two and a half years

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,220
I have had the wonderful privilege of

219
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,800
working on the NPM website and I have

220
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,560
learned a ton of things I cannot go over

221
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,330
every single thing that we learned but

222
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,470
here are some kind of really high-level

223
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,620
highlights when we vary only first

224
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,800
started NPM I I started on the first day

225
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,490
a week later my coworker CJ started and

226
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,440
I'm sitting there just frantically

227
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,660
trying to figure out okay I just need to

228
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,000
put stars in the website let me add Ajax

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,320
like there was no javascript in the

230
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,930
original version of the of the web app

231
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,780
and seizure comes in and she's like okay

232
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,780
we are going to add metrics and logging

233
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,850
immediately and I was like why would we

234
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,220
do that that makes no sense right now

235
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,350
our servers keep falling over our

236
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,720
community is really upset with us we

237
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,780
need to build stuff fast well there's a

238
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,360
reason why CJ is now the CTO and I've

239
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,530
only made my way up to engineering

240
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,580
manager because it turns out that

241
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,410
metrics give you the information that

242
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,900
you didn't know you needed metrics tell

243
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,180
you what your users and what your

244
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,250
systems are doing because while you can

245
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,750
guess what they're doing you can't

246
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,240
actually know with real hard data until

247
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,730
you start adding metrics logs allow you

248
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,440
to basically record those metrics and

249
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,390
search them later so those two things

250
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,790
really come hand-in-hand for you to

251
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,950
really understand what the heck is going

252
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,050
on and let me tell you the sooner you do

253
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,370
it the easier

254
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,020
is to continue doing it and you'll have

255
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,210
all of that data from the beginning the

256
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,890
worst thing is when product comes in and

257
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,170
says hey so we have this idea what do

258
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,220
you think you're like hmm when you have

259
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,529
the actual data that's when you can

260
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,600
really kind of push forward and say yes

261
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,940
this is a great idea or no our users are

262
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,240
never going to want to do this to see

263
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,089
something a little bit yeah interesting

264
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,800
but I'm gonna give it to from a

265
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
different angle at some point so the

266
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,220
original website that Isaac built it was

267
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,270
a hand-rolled just kind of framework

268
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,120
that he built on his own and it was fine

269
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,760
except for the part where when I needed

270
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,770
to come on to on board it took me six

271
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,810
months to figure out how it all worked

272
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,210
and that was really difficult so we

273
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,980
decided to scrap it all entirely and

274
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,860
start from scratch now when you're

275
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,570
starting an app from scratch there are

276
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,430
so many options so many opportunities

277
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,029
and honestly it doesn't matter which one

278
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,310
you choose or if you even choose one at

279
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,930
all at the ultimately that it comes down

280
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,779
to the fact that your framework if you

281
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,500
choose one it okay let me phrase it this

282
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,370
way there is no one framework to solve

283
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,000
every single problem never ever ever

284
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,320
it's important if you're going to pick a

285
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,500
framework to pick one that suits your

286
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,380
needs specifically so assess what your

287
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,110
needs are and then focus on that I don't

288
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,410
care which one you choose if at all that

289
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,990
said use a framework please use a

290
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,760
framework when you're an early stage

291
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,800
startup you don't have time to be making

292
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,500
a billion in seven decisions right let

293
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,970
me tell you if you have 20 engineers in

294
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,500
a room you're going to have 50 different

295
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,970
opinions on how things should be done

296
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,640
right like we all know this a framework

297
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,080
gives you the opportunity to let

298
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,910
somebody else make those decisions let

299
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,170
someone else have the opinions and

300
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,520
everyone else just kind of fall in line

301
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,400
because you have to get product out you

302
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,990
don't have to sit there fighting about

303
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,770
whether or not you should have

304
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,720
semicolons or call backs or promises or

305
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,730
what you don't need that on your on your

306
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,110
plate you just don't that said we

307
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,080
ultimately decided to use happy j/s for

308
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,760
back-end framework if you want to know

309
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,460
why we chose happy over say something

310
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,810
like Express let's talk about that

311
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,760
afterwards but that was a decision that

312
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,090
we made similarly for our front-end we

313
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,680
haven't implemented a front-end

314
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,450
framework yet but we're thinking about

315
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,680
which one we're going to go with

316
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,870
ultimately again it doesn't matter which

317
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,660
one you choose but it does matter that

318
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,270
you pick something and stick with it the

319
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,130
absolute worst thing you can ever do is

320
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,860
implement a framework into your app and

321
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,710
then either not use it at all or fight

322
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,410
it if you find yourself fighting your

323
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,080
framework just stop get rid of your

324
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,670
framework and pick a new one that will

325
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:10,440
actually work with what you need as the

326
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,510
websites as the web team started to grow

327
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,130
an interesting thing started happening

328
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,260
because at first I was the only one

329
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,090
working on the website it was great

330
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,920
right because I had everything in my

331
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,870
brain I knew everything that I needed to

332
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,060
know every decision that was made all of

333
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,370
it the whole code base was in my head at

334
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,490
all times but then an interesting thing

335
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,260
happens when you bring someone else to

336
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,100
new to get the team right it's suddenly

337
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,610
like you have this whole arc

338
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,290
archaeological dig site you can see all

339
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,270
the decisions that were made but you'll

340
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,910
never know why they were made you you

341
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,370
can see what was done you'll never

342
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,080
understand what were the things that led

343
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,750
up to those decisions so ultimately

344
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,240
people would come and be like why why

345
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,370
are we doing it this way and I would

346
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,080
look at them like well isn't it obvious

347
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,090
and you're like no there's no

348
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,400
documentation this one function isn't

349
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,360
tested at all there's nothing here so

350
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,920
that was a huge moment for me to realize

351
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,610
that in order to get people to be in to

352
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,500
understand what's going on in this code

353
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,030
base we had to implement some new

354
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,250
processes that meant more pair

355
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,370
programming and even more importantly

356
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,840
whenever we get new things from product

357
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,030
we actually sit down and and have a

358
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,470
discussion about what decisions we

359
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,810
should be making and that was super

360
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,120
critical and so valuable because now

361
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,770
everybody is on the same page at the

362
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,490
same time as you're building your as

363
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,420
you're writing your code and you're

364
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,000
building your app there's this moment

365
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,770
when you know you need to push your

366
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,760
production

367
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,060
but you're probably a little nervous so

368
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,950
why why are you a little nervous well

369
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,450
it's probably because you're not as

370
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,560
confident in your code is you really

371
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,990
want to be ultimately this comes down to

372
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,240
testing right you know that you can put

373
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,240
stuff out when when it's really good

374
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,460
quality code when you trust your code

375
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,550
that means you are happy to let it go

376
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,860
out into production when I first started

377
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,510
when this team first started we thought

378
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,850
okay you know what unit tests let's just

379
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,560
focus on the unit tests because any

380
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,240
testing is better than no testing at all

381
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,930
for sure but about it got to the point

382
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,090
where we would throw things up into

383
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,520
staging and while all the individual

384
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,680
pieces of code worked just fine the

385
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,200
integration points didn't and why was

386
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,850
that well we didn't have any integration

387
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,860
tests so it was impossible for us to

388
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,620
know because we we mocked out all of our

389
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,430
API calls in our unit tests so if we had

390
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,440
no idea we did not realize that the

391
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,230
actual API calls from our external AP is

392
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,660
the the stuff that was coming out of

393
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,730
there was not much I was not matching

394
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,460
what we were expecting so eventually we

395
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,380
did put in integration tests I want to

396
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,230
make a huge shout out to Nemo Jas

397
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,750
they're made by the folks at paypal it

398
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,940
is the best rapper around selenium I've

399
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,340
ever seen so if you're if you're sitting

400
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,780
there going and I don't know about

401
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,900
integration tests nemo d is a promise

402
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,500
it's worth your time speaking about

403
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,420
trust n pm's ethos is all about the many

404
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,940
small modules we love small modules

405
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,010
there they make code easier to write

406
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,260
they make your code stronger and better

407
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,870
but ultimately there is that one tiny

408
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,970
caveat which is that you didn't

409
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,470
necessarily always right all of those

410
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,320
little modules so you have to trust the

411
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,820
people who created them in the first

412
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,320
place but what happens when that trust

413
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,450
is slightly broken we had an incident

414
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,640
where we implemented we created a

415
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,860
brand-new markdown parser and we added

416
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,500
it to the website and that was super

417
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,630
super great because it was beautiful and

418
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,450
it worked fast except for whatever

419
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,110
reason every 36 hours or so our website

420
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,610
would just go down and crash

421
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,260
because there was a massive memory leak

422
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,870
we had no idea why it took us six months

423
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,000
before before we we actually sat down

424
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,710
and just went through line by line

425
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,690
figured out where this memory leak was

426
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,780
it turns out that within our markdown

427
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,230
dependency there was a dependency that

428
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,390
was a dependency of another dependency

429
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,910
that had a memory leak in some c++ code

430
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,670
and they had never seen that leak

431
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,400
because nobody was using that that one

432
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,880
tiny module at the scale that we were so

433
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,980
we found this leak and the beauty of

434
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,020
open source is that we found the leak we

435
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,809
put in we put in a pull request and then

436
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:34,059
using the beauty of some ver just kind

437
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,190
of like worked our way back up memory

438
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,750
leak gone push it out to production

439
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,559
fantastic everything is fine again but

440
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,840
you do have to trust that is that is a

441
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,350
big thing I totally trust all of it just

442
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:52,809
you know okay now the fun thing about

443
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:55,900
working on a website is that you really

444
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,260
bring an entire company together right

445
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,730
everybody loves working on the website

446
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,110
everybody has an opinion about what

447
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,730
should be on the website and that's

448
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,799
because for a lot of companies the

449
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,840
website is your one opportunity to

450
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,360
interact with the user base npm is

451
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,130
interesting because we have a CLI and

452
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,049
that's where all of our users interact

453
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,440
with us but our marketing team and our

454
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,410
support team and our Doc's team they all

455
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,809
need to use the only to talk to you some

456
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:25,150
way somehow and that's in addition to

457
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,040
all the products that we're building so

458
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,440
one of the biggest difficulties we had

459
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,230
early on and actually even still to this

460
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,960
day is figuring out how to really

461
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,210
prioritize all of the different

462
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,610
requirements and needs which are all

463
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,790
valid in a way that we can really push

464
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,950
everything out the door especially given

465
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,200
that we have such a tiny tiny team the

466
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,910
fact that everybody wants their say on

467
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,799
how the website should look or act or

468
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,919
feel it can be really overwhelming so we

469
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,260
started we did two things and like I

470
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,059
said it's a work in progress but the

471
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,340
first thing we did was we started adding

472
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,870
some kind of project management some

473
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,790
product management to get people to kind

474
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,770
of line up and say okay here are the

475
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,590
major things that we need to accomplish

476
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,630
and that's been really helpful because

477
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,980
it allows us to kind of put into

478
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,779
perspective okay this is the next thing

479
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,340
that we need to accomplish everybody's

480
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,620
on board cool but the other thing that

481
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,419
we did from a technical side is we

482
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,640
started breaking the website down it's a

483
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,159
massive monolith at the moment but we're

484
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:24,970
starting to breaking it down into

485
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,130
different micro services which will

486
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,940
allow individual teams a 10pm to kind of

487
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,850
take over their own personal piece so

488
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,950
for example the marketing team will have

489
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,850
their own kind of marketing service that

490
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,230
you as the user won't ever actually

491
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,720
notice any difference but at least what

492
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,340
that means is the marketing team can go

493
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,809
ahead and push out the code they need

494
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:49,059
whenever they want without having to

495
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:51,100
incur the three-team three-person team

496
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,720
bottleneck now probably the hardest

497
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,820
lesson that we've learned in the last

498
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,929
two and a half years comes down to this

499
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,789
when Isaac first started NPM he did

500
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:05,350
everything an open source and it was

501
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,450
fantastic it was really really really

502
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,909
wonderful in fact all of us who joined

503
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:11,590
NPM especially on the engineering team

504
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,289
we were super ecstatic because how great

505
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:15,909
is it to have somebody else pay you to

506
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:17,649
work on open source like that is just

507
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,059
the coolest thing ever no more nights

508
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,940
and weekends this is your day job and it

509
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,809
was great but then something happened we

510
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,640
had to get stuff out the door we had a

511
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,890
move on product our team was too small

512
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,529
we didn't have any bandwidth or the

513
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,899
people or the time to really focus on

514
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:37,630
the user community so people would put

515
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,130
in pull requests and issues and we were

516
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,500
like okay well let's get to this but

517
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,600
then another thing happened which is

518
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,580
that the registry team decided to break

519
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,649
out the registry into lots of different

520
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:50,679
micro services which was great it made

521
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,870
us move a lot faster internally but it

522
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,940
meant that our user base couldn't

523
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,340
replicate the website locally because

524
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,260
all of these services were private and

525
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,789
everything like that and it was just

526
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:03,429
suddenly you could clone the repo but

527
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:06,250
you couldn't actually do anything with

528
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,590
it and Sippie would put in issues and

529
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,080
they'd be like hey I think I think this

530
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,399
is wrong but I don't know because I

531
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:15,460
can't replicate it but maybe you could

532
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,039
do it for us it's like we don't have the

533
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:20,320
time to do that oh gosh this is really

534
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,700
bad and

535
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,080
just kind of kept building up and

536
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,789
building up and it was kind of terrible

537
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:27,460
and at the same time we had the

538
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,570
situation where because our repo was

539
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,029
open source at the time like we've been

540
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:36,870
using Travis continuous integration for

541
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,220
last year and a half or so and it's been

542
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,529
fantastic at the time the if you have a

543
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,200
public repo you end up in the same queue

544
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,090
as all the other public repose which

545
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,220
sometimes meant that even if it was a

546
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,070
massive security bug fix it could take

547
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,799
up to an hour maybe two to get our build

548
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,320
to go that's not acceptable for a

549
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,750
production level website so we did a

550
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,029
little experiment we we went ahead and

551
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,669
we've made a private Fork of the website

552
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:09,070
just to see what happens well first of

553
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,169
all the Travis fields went the the

554
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:13,360
timing went down super it was super fast

555
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,669
right so great we can move forward and

556
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,100
we can move really quickly but then

557
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,360
another thing happened nobody noticed

558
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,980
nobody noticed that we made a private

559
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,100
Fork of everything like the public open

560
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,019
source version of our website was stale

561
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:31,539
for months and there may be two people

562
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:33,039
who are like hey wait a second this

563
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,500
doesn't quite look right but I'm talking

564
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,880
to out of all of our users that was it

565
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,179
was kind of like well so at this point

566
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,299
it kind of just feels like just a view

567
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,850
source button which it was really

568
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,950
awesome talking to miles the other night

569
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,919
he talked about open source vs. view

570
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,090
source and I thought it was a brilliant

571
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,669
brilliant idea but that was basically we

572
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,750
were doing we're just kind of showing

573
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,340
off our website but we couldn't let

574
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,059
anybody really comment on it or work

575
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,490
with it or play with it and so we made

576
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,830
the really tough decision to go ahead

577
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:14,350
and just shut it down that's hard it's

578
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,630
really hard believe me there was a lot

579
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,299
of angry people internally to the

580
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,980
company there were a lot of discussions

581
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,779
there were very heated discussions that

582
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:25,120
happen because of it now the way that

583
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,710
we've mollified it is that in the

584
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,929
process of taking our monolithic app and

585
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:30,220
breaking it down into smaller pieces

586
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,799
we're open sourcing the tiny modules

587
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,899
right and those are a lot easier to

588
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:35,350
maintain

589
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,950
because it's 30 lines of code there's a

590
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,320
pull request great and it's easy to see

591
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,549
an easy to test and it's fantastic so

592
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,340
that was rough but it happened now

593
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,070
through all of this we have learned a

594
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,890
ton of lessons right we've made a bunch

595
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,570
of mistakes we've made some really good

596
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,760
decisions and we paid a ton of progress

597
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,799
and just change this website so much but

598
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,360
ultimately no matter what mistakes we

599
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,860
made no matter what decisions we made

600
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,929
thin in the day we're going to make more

601
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:09,130
mistakes and we're going to make more

602
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,150
decisions and it's just going to

603
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,679
continue cycling because change is

604
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,080
inevitable as we move forward as we

605
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,549
continue learning we're going to get

606
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:17,200
we're going to learn yet even more and

607
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,990
ultimately personally I want to thank

608
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,580
you all for giving us that opportunity

609
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,880
because honestly it's because of all of

610
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,250
our users that we continually want and

611
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,110
strive to change and it's because of you

612
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,750
who use these products and services that

613
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,880
we are desperate to get out that we can

614
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,620
continue to maintain this wonderful

615
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,240
ecosystem and really build up this

616
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,700
community in every other way that we

617
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,159
possibly can so with that huge huge huge

618
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,669
thanks it's great to be here I have a

619
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:54,370
few pairs of socks um what do you mean

620
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,809
I'm not bribing me to be my friend's uh

621
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:59,860
so if you would like to maybe pukur one

622
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,350
of these I'd come hang out with me and

623
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,460
ask me questions and let's talk about

624
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,100
NPM and let's talk about the website or

625
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,409
the CLI or anything I want to hear your

626
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:12,909
opinions I want to hear what you have to

627
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:15,659
say that matters a lot to me all right
