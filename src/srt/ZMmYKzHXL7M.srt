1
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,890

so again my name is to mommy and I think

2
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,200
people who know me know me as a little

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,570
girlie mag it's my twitter handle and

4
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,090
I'm mobile-focused front-end engineer

5
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,460
with the you like focus and currently

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,440
I'm working in nokia I've been working

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,090
Pinocchio i canna ear or so as a web

8
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,180
stunt or the open web advocate and the

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,370
before work in a nokia i've been working

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,360
full palm webos if you remember and yeah

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,640
I've been tickled oh gosh she was blood

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,140
all of sudden yeah I've been taking

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,080
charge of the UI a pole web OS platform

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,830
or and little in the palm pre phones and

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,500
touchpad and it previously i've been

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,930
working in yahoo mobile so basically

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,580
I've been working for mobile space for a

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,170
long time and also yeah besides mobile

19
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,030
I've also known as HTTP status cat lady

20
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,189
the reason it's you might not know me

21
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,829
but I think you might have seen those

22
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,179
stuff i have created that gave me some

23
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:32,969
accidental 15 minutes of fame and it was

24
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,399
totally unintentional but it went by a

25
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,259
role is kind of cool so yeah I can talk

26
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,539
about cats whole entire time but I'm not

27
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,670
going to so now I'm going to talk about

28
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,039
JavaScript since I'm on Jess comp in

29
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:56,429
html5 for mobile so again i'm going to

30
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:59,249
start talking about uri schemes so this

31
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:01,469
is nothing javascript actually and this

32
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,350
is some old school stuff it's nothing

33
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,250
new and defined by oma for XHTML MP

34
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,430
that's XHTML mobile profile so it's

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,990
being there and implementing the brass

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,510
of a long time and you probably already

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,260
know just like a male 2 but it's sort of

38
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,470
obscure things you might know so you can

39
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,380
just finish

40
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,780
the phone call by giving this a URL

41
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,220
scheme will PL tell to make a phone call

42
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,110
you know basically opens up for for my

43
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,080
app if you need advice heads form or you

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,120
can even text by using SMS this game and

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,330
there's something I recently heard about

46
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,570
like what WG hub whitelisted some other

47
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,690
URI scheme like Bitcoin lately I haven't

48
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,000
seen how it works and stuff but it'll be

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,340
kind of cool and also something like if

50
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,240
be like custom non-standard URI scheme

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,240
to open up facebook app if it's an iOS

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,910
and stuff but that's against non

53
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,310
standard so the UI actually UX it really

54
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,920
depends on OS you know which operating

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,870
system the browser its own so first

56
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,150
screenshot here is actually for mom

57
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,470
windows from eight so once you use a tap

58
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,370
the link of the phone phone number some

59
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,230
actually goes to this screen so the user

60
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,540
had a chance to edit before making a

61
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,880
phone call might have to add like you

62
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,460
know country code and stuff in the next

63
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,160
points on Android I don't remember if

64
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,780
this gradual is from Chrome or Firefox

65
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,670
or other browsers the basically a cozy

66
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,670
you know goodson same screen basically

67
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,570
it's open up the phone app and then it

68
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,420
is a way you know the browser never make

69
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,520
phone call an initiative phone call by

70
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,860
itself without the users knowledge you

71
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,680
always have to initiate a call so in

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,630
this case and of course you know nothing

73
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,490
happens until you set up just call

74
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,040
button so it's safe and another voice

75
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,950
for SMS not android is basically open up

76
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,640
the messaging app and again it doesn't

77
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,030
send a message by itself

78
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,040
in geo location is another thing I don't

79
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,510
really have to explain too much i'm

80
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,490
pretty sure everybody here already know

81
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,070
but it is you known as a way that you

82
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,320
can access hardware and there are more

83
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,630
than a few ways do because you know your

84
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,940
device doesn't necessarily have to have

85
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,780
GPS so you know it's easier and you're

86
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,660
detecting the users current location and

87
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,900
location by GPS satellite extra GPS or

88
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,710
sell IDs and assisted GPS is a

89
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,740
software-based or Wi-Fi base stations

90
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,500
and then it would basically this is

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,780
called snippet of you know how you get

92
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,930
the current positions once you get a

93
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,870
location coordinates get successful back

94
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,770
here and again this has access

95
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,240
permission for users as well so I mean

96
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,590
the developer can't steal information

97
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,650
about where you are at so always you

98
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,110
know ask the browser make it into ask

99
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,200
users to give it permission and this you

100
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,470
I really depends on browser so you

101
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,880
probably haven't seen those before

102
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,190
because these screen shots are taken

103
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,290
from the first one is from webos and

104
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,660
another one's me go so you probably

105
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,300
haven't seen it and then the next one is

106
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,340
action not from geolocation this is full

107
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,250
okay use immediate formations again get

108
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,150
used get user media never takes your

109
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,420
father also you know open up the webcam

110
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,520
without your permission so this is safe

111
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,150
for users

112
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,620
another cool feature some of the you

113
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,810
know thing you can do is JavaScript this

114
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,020
device orientation events so there's a

115
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,360
freedom event to get the information

116
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,600
about physical orientation movement of

117
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,990
the device and the information the basic

118
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,510
information can get a gyro collimator

119
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:17,780
and comb pass and this is actually this

120
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,690
diagram comes from a developer website I

121
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,220
took it from there and I should read

122
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,530
it's pretty good informative web page

123
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,960
and this explains how the device

124
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,610
orientation paint works so it has

125
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,680
basically the motion of the device and

126
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,770
you know which way rotates so alpha beta

127
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,990
and gamma and alpha is a one it's

128
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,450
actually works at compass so it detects

129
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:44,990
in north south and west east ended oh

130
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,480
yeah and the device motion it's like the

131
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,320
accelerator I mean so it basically tells

132
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,530
how fast you know device throttles maybe

133
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,300
I would stay always say if you'll

134
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,140
driving with your phone or more likely

135
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,600
you have a phone in car and how you can

136
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,040
tell I mean by using this ben de can

137
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,780
pretty much tell how fast your device is

138
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,000
traveling with you are and kompis needs'

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,030
calibration it's the exactly what is

140
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,640
there the company's calculation it gives

141
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,770
the supposed to give a UI of a you know

142
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,169
the a figure or maybe infinity or

143
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,770
whatever but I don't think it's working

144
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,480
I mean it's being employment in any

145
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,380
process yet I haven't seen it's working

146
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,280
so this is a quick demo I wrote it's

147
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,270
really so use a diversity orientation

148
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,060
events basically used with css3 you know

149
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,370
transform to just move it is a try and

150
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,210
load it with the movement over this

151
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,400
device and when you put the person flat

152
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,060
surface it keeps the answer but then

153
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,669
recently my friend told me about the

154
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:03,350
diss github for full page

155
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,250
well i justjust it it's not morning so

156
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,259
this page is kind of cute you know I

157
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:10,870
have a parallax effect and that's when

158
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,610
you move the mouse it moves in the

159
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,129
background moves and apparently that use

160
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,050
the device orientation events do so when

161
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,419
you hit this bitch extent to hit 44 and

162
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:22,120
your tablet or something you know it

163
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,580
moves around as you move it's kind of

164
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,300
silly but it's cute oh now I don't know

165
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:39,149
how to get back

166
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,310
so it is his actual code code snippet

167
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,680
from the demo I just wrote so basically

168
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,420
just using you know listening event and

169
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,040
the device on the best orientation

170
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,430
events there and get the info from the

171
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,269
alpha beta gamma and using the CSS and

172
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:03,220
the sorry keep stepping on something the

173
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,949
browser support it's okay you know it's

174
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:07,990
been supporting the most of mobile

175
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,569
browsers here and when actually had to

176
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:12,639
tell you about when I'm talking about

177
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,769
this browser compatibility here I'm

178
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:17,800
talking about mobile so you might say

179
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,079
it's like oh it's been supported by from

180
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,810
such that even in earlier and such but

181
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,490
I'm just talking about mobile here so

182
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,100
when I'm talking back from today here

183
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,620
I'm talking about crumpled Android so

184
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,899
the earliest version of the Cronin of

185
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,660
all android is 18 so basically when I

186
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,689
say a team is it's been working since

187
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:40,509
the first version and same thing for

188
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:43,389
firefox so I'm not talking about Firefox

189
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,120
for desktop talk about Firefox for

190
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,970
Android and unfortunately i don't have

191
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,670
firefox OS device yet so i haven't

192
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,850
tested any so when I talk about Firefox

193
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,290
it's only for Android and the Opera it's

194
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,810
not it's not the webkit-based Albert's

195
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:07,290
bristol-based offer and Judes over 12

196
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,660
and yeah it's a blackberry time and the

197
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,660
last item has a Python so I actually

198
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,620
just got place and device last week so i

199
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,079
have tested a little bit this weekend so

200
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,910
i don't know much about this device I

201
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,180
mean the browser yet but anyway I tested

202
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,069
and it's working fine and that the

203
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:29,589
ladies ties in browser a bit by the way

204
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:32,350
I Tizen it's a WebKit the WebKit to base

205
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,540
browser and a use case is hopeful use

206
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,819
cases photos API they just mentioned

207
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:43,809
above it's a this iOS app called pizza

208
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,990
compaq actually I don't really use iOS

209
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,820
so

210
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,460
I haven't really used this Apple myself

211
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,680
but I read about it so basically what it

212
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,670
does is for user at the compa so this

213
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,070
pizza compass tells you where you are in

214
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,470
the location and it just gives you an

215
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,260
earless pizza place I like yeah you know

216
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,970
what I think I can do that with

217
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,720
JavaScript pretty easy right so

218
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,830
basically what you have to do is you

219
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,560
know use a navigator geolocation to get

220
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,910
use a location and use a user comparison

221
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,520
device orientation events with the Alpha

222
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,770
get informational by alpha get cold fast

223
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,190
and just you know use some API it's maps

224
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,470
and local businesses api's from

225
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,140
somewhere and just get that you know the

226
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,240
grab from phone numbers or make a phone

227
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,180
call by using this up tell you are a

228
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,240
scheme so should be able to do it the

229
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,950
camera access so yet no you can you know

230
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,810
access the device native a camera by

231
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,690
using javascript and one of those is a

232
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,800
WebRTC oven it's a part of the web RTC

233
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,460
Piccadilly and using it using media and

234
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,500
the mobile browser support for

235
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,700
getusermedia it's not quite yeah so

236
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,130
looks like operas really paeonia like a

237
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,800
first one is supported but again that's

238
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,100
not a web kiddo WebKit opera I tested it

239
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,200
with latest opera you know with

240
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,050
webkit-based not blink yet for the for

241
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,690
mobile I think it's a 14 is a webkit

242
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,220
based and it wasn't working sadly and

243
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,670
chrome 26 I put star there because this

244
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,520
is you still need a Miss Webb get

245
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,330
extension i mean the vendor prefix but

246
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,720
yeah this is I think the newest column

247
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,300
now it's 27 but it just happened

248
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,370
recently it wasn't working before it

249
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,370
just started supporting I think and

250
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,670
other the browsers like Firefox and pie

251
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,280
then it looks like it's being Paula

252
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,410
minted because you know the feature

253
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,779
detection but

254
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,810
feature detection lie so it doesn't mean

255
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,420
it works so I didn't make it to work

256
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,870
maybe I did wrong I don't know so that's

257
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,480
actual photo i took from my android

258
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,139
phone obvious a little silly demo not

259
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:22,300
that one I made it for Responsible well

260
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,240
demo so again yeah has a user permission

261
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,389
so you never use a you know webcam with

262
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:35,199
the formation it's not really working

263
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,149
yeah basically a has a fish in

264
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,009
JavaScript Fisher detection to make my

265
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:45,860
favorite spongebob it's a little slow

266
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,170
it's not right going maybe because i'm

267
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:54,680
not looking at the camera mmhmm yeah it

268
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,360
works on the phone you know you know

269
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,459
android Oh still okay all right I don't

270
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:14,130
oh my gosh it's funny okay

271
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,430
again so that's actually tested in them

272
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,750
nexus 4 but another things and that

273
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,760
there's another way to you know access

274
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,640
the native camera and this is something

275
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,220
extra my favorite the HTML media capture

276
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,560
this is different from you and get user

277
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,500
media it's not using I mean it you see

278
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,090
there's no JavaScript involves there

279
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,080
right it's just a mock-up so you see

280
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,910
this is nothing with an input here right

281
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:52,250
input element it's the file type type

282
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,410
its file so this is just like a file

283
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,710
upload but the difference is so now we

284
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,670
have a the two attributes yet except and

285
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,520
capture so basically specified accept

286
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,810
images in a caption camera and this is

287
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,640
this is all implementation allows their

288
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,160
old specifications but this is what it

289
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,590
currently browser support and a new spec

290
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,020
is captured says the boolean because

291
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,110
when you specified image it's obviously

292
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,360
you try to get the camera these are

293
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,520
other things like the recording can

294
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,420
record our microphones in a video as

295
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,840
well so you don't have to specify its

296
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,180
camera it is pennyweights this is new

297
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,250
and then i don't think any browsers have

298
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,880
supported yet so currently um chrome

299
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,760
android blackberry 10 and ties and

300
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,080
support is just fine and i'm testing iOS

301
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,190
firefox on android and I eat as well but

302
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,990
the the reason I put star that the

303
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,600
partial support is some well you can

304
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,870
still access cameras but the breath of

305
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,420
heaven implemented this correctly that

306
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,100
means that the capture attribute is not

307
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,010
working so basically when you try text

308
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,280
access or try to use this the browser

309
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,860
asks if you want to take camera or

310
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,930
choose pictures from your hard drive

311
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,270
somewhere like album something that's

312
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,090
fine but it's still wrong so bugs me

313
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,020
wild ie10

314
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,160
that's another thing a future detection

315
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,300
life so appears to be supported but it

316
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
doesn't work so I asked the guys and

317
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,950
Microsoft and apparently this is

318
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,630
disabled for mobile when I'm used in the

319
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,390
windows 8 even windows RT at least it

320
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,940
supports partially but it just doesn't

321
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,420
do anything for mobile phones and it's

322
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,990
pretty bad experience and this is the

323
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,920
demo of actual app I wrote this step is

324
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,220
web app and it's called Cuomo camera and

325
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,840
this is entirely written in JavaScript

326
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,340
so basically what it does Oh miss koala

327
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,310
does it's a tap the button and take the

328
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:16,560
photo and apply the filter you save it

329
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,950
this I 7 locally in a browser or send it

330
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,610
to the server and you may have seen app

331
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,250
like this before somewhere I'm not

332
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,140
trying to select somebody for 1 billion

333
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:35,690
but it's open source at it for free

334
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,989
so yeah you might have seen similar

335
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:50,460
interface somewhere

336
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,679
so again I brought entirely in

337
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,679
JavaScript and use the HTML media

338
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:12,910
capture while I explain quickly

339
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,810
I actually have done like entire

340
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,210
presentation about this app it has so

341
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:32,030
much to talk about actually

342
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,990
so again yeah idea that I html5 you

343
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,640
sched talk before in a different

344
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,460
conferences because i want to show you

345
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,890
know actually how you can use html5

346
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,860
features to write apps so fold a

347
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,840
particular app what i did is taking a

348
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,120
photo with the native camera by using

349
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,880
HTML video capture and it's a camera

350
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,060
returns the picture as a file object and

351
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,840
as you can get from file reader then

352
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,970
dump the whole dinner pictures into

353
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,430
canvas using the draw image method to

354
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,660
the draw the image object on campus then

355
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,520
it's going to get image data to get the

356
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,400
whole pixel data from the you know

357
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,710
contain copy of that pixel data from the

358
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,770
context then I just manipulate those

359
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,560
pixels you know the giving give-give

360
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,860
like grayscale filters or you know the

361
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,250
CP ER and kind of stuff then and use a

362
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,740
we are using a canvas too blob method to

363
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,370
store the blog and to a store locally in

364
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,220
it with you using index TV then finally

365
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,860
you can and let you use the upload photo

366
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,680
by using xhr and course actually index

367
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,900
DB it's a tricky one I put stars because

368
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,480
I say blob store the blahblah XD be but

369
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,110
only five of supports joining blobbin

370
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,410
index DB that's a whole other big topics

371
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,450
and I have time to talk about but

372
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,340
anyways for Chrome another browser

373
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,920
that's what I did was just storing

374
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,920
base64 string but huge string so it's

375
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,310
really not a good idea to do so I think

376
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,760
anyways so it's not a github it's open

377
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,240
sourced it's not done yet but oh it's

378
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,200
working and okay so move on to a better

379
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,630
study say PA so another things you can

380
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,700
do with javascript it's detecting how

381
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,220
much juice left in your form or you know

382
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,590
even you can detect a few phones being

383
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,810
charged or not what are you using those

384
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,480
events and charging change the level

385
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,270
change events and you will the browser

386
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,400
support it's still not great it's only

387
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,470
supported by Firefox enticing

388
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,870
and so far and if we're Tizen you need a

389
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,110
web get a prefix and for Firefox I think

390
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,440
you can provide safe to drop now yeah i

391
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,159
think the firefox guys dropped the

392
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,520
prefix after version 16 and this is

393
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,150
actual code I wrote I mean just damn

394
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,090
quick demo on it actual photos so you

395
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,059
can see this is charged so he knows it's

396
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,340
been charged and other ones not charged

397
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,770
but note that the pilot that's a

398
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:20,409
sixty-seven percent left and vibration

399
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:23,169
api's and other things you can do this

400
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:26,169
so yeah it is something called a vibrate

401
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,840
at the navigator object I'm navigate a

402
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,630
vibrant is just used you need a prefix

403
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,720
as well well basically what it does it

404
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,250
by radiophone I oh you know what I don't

405
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,860
think you can hear I have a it's button

406
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,929
now thank you yeah I expected to have

407
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:49,559
extra mic so you can hear but anyways I

408
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,720
don't have a good use case so this so

409
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,950
just demo and another cool stuff is you

410
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,140
can access the light sensor in the

411
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,740
device and it is used yeah that's easy

412
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:08,110
the device light event so the value

413
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,370
gives actual brightness of the

414
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,490
environment around the form in the unit

415
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,610
of lux so basically gives numbers like a

416
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,370
400 oh this is actually observation from

417
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:26,890
my galaxy nexus one so I'm not sure

418
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,110
about accuracy of this little bit yeah

419
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,020
but basically when you are in an

420
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,460
indoor/outdoor well then daylight it

421
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,250
gives an you know different valleys and

422
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,559
I live in San Francisco and it's foggy

423
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,049
so I couldn't really get tested for over

424
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:43,570
thousand actually and I should test it

425
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,950
here on

426
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,490
time and in sunny Claudia but

427
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,020
unfortunately my galaxy nexus phones get

428
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,900
stolen while ago so now I have a nexus 4

429
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,300
but I think light sensor of this bones

430
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,290
somehow not right i mean i don't get its

431
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,030
supposed to give it a value in double

432
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,580
but i always get integer value and it's

433
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,920
really low so i'm not sure if it's the

434
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,470
light sensors working and other things

435
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,840
SSO I just said the value is in double

436
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,210
but then as a new specifications ikea

437
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,730
that's really confusing why don't you

438
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,130
give just a you know string value C

439
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,810
easier to understand and damn no more

440
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,330
bright and maybe the good idea it's too

441
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,030
new and I know browser supported yet I

442
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,960
had to go quick oh it yeah it's demo but

443
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,430
just some you know try to create a

444
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,860
shadow on phone geez just to see the

445
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,260
number changes i know i should write a

446
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:59,250
better demo but yeah I

447
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,480
and proximately events as something

448
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,930
similar so you can sit approximately

449
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,960
sensor the device so you can tell if the

450
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,480
object is nearby or far maybe ears

451
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,150
touching the phone will not but it's

452
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,430
still this is too new i guess none of

453
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,380
the browser support it but I'm hoping

454
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,330
it's going to be supported soon and

455
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,640
there are more AP eyes I really don't

456
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,550
have time to even explain but there's a

457
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,650
bunch of other more ap is maybe some

458
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,620
birds is already about it maybe not one

459
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,180
particularly interesting for me is a

460
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,310
clipboard API has cut and copy and paste

461
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,220
that will be cool and network discovery

462
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,340
it's like universal plug play multimedia

463
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,130
device like you can you know operates

464
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,370
the other devices and as well and

465
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,720
hostname maybe it's supported already

466
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,930
and gamepad API and push notifications

467
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,380
and there's some aps or not i'm not sure

468
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,200
but like contact api's and calendar api

469
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,280
is a actually there specify the based on

470
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,190
the web intents but apparently google

471
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,310
ditched web intents so I don't know what

472
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,710
happens to those API but I had just keep

473
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,380
on because now we see mozillas doing

474
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,660
something new called web activities I'm

475
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,060
not sure if that's going to replace the

476
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,950
web in 10 so something I don't know so

477
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,200
that's about it and thank you very much

478
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,770

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,390
or not and my github that happens sorry

482
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,180
