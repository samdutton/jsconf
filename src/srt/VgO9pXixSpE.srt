1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,469

hello my name is my name is luke and I

2
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:17,869
had JavaScript wait which conference is

3
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:25,880
this oh right yeah so actually I'm not

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,400
entirely kidding I really I really don't

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,170
like JavaScript and I've been doing

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,820
cross-browser compatible web development

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,630
for about about 10 years most of that

8
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,840
time I've had to deal with CSS issues

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,900
between the browsers which if you've

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,340
been around long enough in this industry

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,500
you know that that basically translates

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,980
into I've had to deal with CSS since

13
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,730
internet explorer has supported CSS and

14
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,580
I'm saying this so that you'll fully

15
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,290
appreciate the significance when I say

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,150
CSS support across the browser's over

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,710
the past 10 years has been a bit of a

18
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:13,289
mess understatement of the century and

19
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,170
so what does that have to do with

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,630
JavaScript well me hating javascript in

21
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,840
particular and it's a it's the same

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,590
thing where it's all the JavaScript

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,850
incompatibilities between the browsers

24
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,729
that I really don't like and that's not

25
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:30,109
so much app script as it is the Dom

26
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:32,600
perhaps but not less in general I just

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,069
don't like to ask it don't like writing

28
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:41,860
it and so

29
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:48,160
oops so I've been doing this CSS thing

30
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,910
mostly for 10 years and you know it's

31
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:57,430
pretty bad when the guy doing CSS is

32
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,250
complaining about JavaScript you know

33
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,320
your situation is pretty bad when I mean

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,360
I feel sorry for you guys having to deal

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,830
with all the JavaScript stuff on a daily

36
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:11,620
basis but wow so this kind of a brief

37
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,870
like two little questions I mean if I

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,080
hate JavaScript Who am I and why am I

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,160
talking at it at a conference so let's

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,230
let's start by the with the first

41
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,500
question Who am I but before I go on to

42
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,900
that just a quick I want to briefly

43
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,630
point out that at this conference I'm

44
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,630
only the third speaker so far I have to

45
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,880
hate on JavaScript so I'm not even first

46
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,650
which says something I think anyway so

47
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,770
Who am I well aside from evidently being

48
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,549
a route 66 traveler I'm I do things like

49
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:51,480
design web standards evangelism

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,250
accessibility photography and you'll

51
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,860
notice that programming isn't really on

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,220
that list now I've done a lot of

53
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,760
programming in my life actually but the

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,959
vast majority of that has been PHP post

55
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,860
grass python in other words mostly

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,760
back-end and database programming so

57
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,160
funny thing is the very little

58
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,519
JavaScript that I've actually done in my

59
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,340
career has somehow given me this this

60
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,650
reputation of also being a JavaScript

61
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,030
guy small reputation but still and I

62
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,130
don't really I have no qualms being

63
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,380
lobbed together with without JavaScript

64
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,480
guys and girls it's you know they're all

65
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,750
good people but i think it's it's not

66
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,790
entirely fitting and i don't think it's

67
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,640
entirely fair to all the very talented

68
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,920
javascript people and here in the

69
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,930
audience who do i can pretty much

70
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,760
guarantee no more about JavaScript than

71
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,260
I do and

72
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,659
which brings us to question number two

73
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:00,010
why am I here what path have I traveled

74
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,010
that leads me to meet mr. I hate

75
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,230
JavaScript to speak here at a JavaScript

76
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,989
conference in Berlin well the first the

77
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,180
first stint that got me this disk urea

78
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,829
sleep laced reputation as being a

79
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,510
JavaScript guy came with face an acronym

80
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,609
that stands for farooq's animated CSS

81
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:21,310
enhancements clearly a very inspired

82
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:27,639
name and face was face was a little tool

83
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,830
kits that I released in in 2005 which it

84
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,990
allows you to do stop-motion animation

85
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,050
using nothing but CSS it is a little

86
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,780
JavaScript toolkit but in using it all

87
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,919
you have to do is write CSS classes and

88
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,500
they would be steps like frames in an

89
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,780
animation the JavaScript would then

90
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,520
figure out what you were trying to do

91
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,900
and it would animate through those

92
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,449
classes and you have your animation all

93
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,539
you have to do is write it in CSS and

94
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,889
somehow because it's JavaScript toolkit

95
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,960
this land me that's this started that

96
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,699
little reputation of being Josh would

97
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:06,250
bag but I find it kind of ironic because

98
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,919
if you really look at face I mean the

99
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,449
whole toolkit is about not writing

100
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:13,060
JavaScript about writing CSS so clearly

101
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,470
people could have figured out that i

102
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,849
don't like javascript back then face

103
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:22,599
eventually led me to a job at a certain

104
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,780
fruit company in california where i

105
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,800
worked for a couple of years for company

106
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,039
which will remain nameless and after

107
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,169
after a couple of years of working there

108
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,250
i left this summer and very shortly

109
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,470
after leaving i released the second

110
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,780
piece of JavaScript that got me as this

111
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,960
recognition and that is moderniser

112
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,010
moderniser is a JavaScript toolkit that

113
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,610
makes it easier to use html5 and css3 in

114
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,550
your websites today and I will go into

115
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,639
that more in a moment first I want to

116
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,770
talk about what face and modernizer have

117
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,449
in common

118
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,860
besides being the combined reason that

119
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,530
I'm standing here talking about

120
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,290
javascript javascript conference I mean

121
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,240
why am I telling you all this is this

122
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,850
just to further inflate my oversized ego

123
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:25,419
no I actually have a point here there

124
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,030
are three main reasons why face and

125
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,220
modernizer got the recognition that they

126
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,330
did now face has basically been made

127
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,930
completely completely obsolete with the

128
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,060
arrival of proper JavaScript driven

129
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,539
animation engines one of which you and I

130
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:46,000
already know and probably use as it's

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,479
part of jQuery I mean who here does not

132
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,280
use jQuery what's wrong with you people

133
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,000
I mean John rezac is he in a room is

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,419
like Europeans el sol face has been made

135
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:09,729
obsolete by proper josh cribbs animation

136
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,039
engines but modernizer first of all

137
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:14,440
monetize is only a couple months old but

138
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,660
it's actually it it's good becoming

139
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,300
increasingly more useful the more people

140
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,340
learn about it and the more people start

141
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,020
using it while building websites and it

142
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,060
started becoming increasingly more

143
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,199
valuable so what do face and modernizer

144
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,080
have in common now first of all they are

145
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,830
both unobtrusive tool kits which means

146
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,830
if you use them properly and as intended

147
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,400
they will not break the website they use

148
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,990
them in they will not break for people

149
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,120
who are be might be using all our

150
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,729
browsers or who might have javascript

151
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,949
disabled or filtered through proxy or

152
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,039
something so there are unobtrusive which

153
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,130
is a good thing second they very

154
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,479
strongly encourage the use of

155
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,690
progressive enhancements and that

156
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,240
basically means that your website will

157
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,340
look better and behave more

158
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,620
interestingly the better the browser is

159
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,490
that you're using it really is just a

160
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,770
way of saying the better your browser

161
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,479
Richard experience of this website will

162
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,550
be for you and that's a powerful thing

163
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,750
we'll get to that in a moment and lastly

164
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,610
they are both accessible they are very

165
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,440
accessible they'll talk wit meaning that

166
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,560
the use of them does not impede on the

167
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,149
web accessibility of your site and that

168
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:41,599
means so yeah it's still possible to use

169
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,159
these toolkits and make a very

170
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,430
inaccessible website but if you use them

171
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,250
as intended as as designed then they

172
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,520
won't have any negative effect on the

173
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,529
web accessibility of your site unlike

174
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:56,540
certain other JavaScript toolkits and

175
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,410
libraries out there so another thing

176
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,870
they have in common is that they serve

177
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,079
to enhance your website in one way or

178
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:10,220
another nowadays website enhancements

179
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,370
come in a large number of you know many

180
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,800
shapes and forms but they're also

181
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,740
becoming increasingly native now what do

182
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,500
I mean with native this kind of refers

183
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,730
back to the whole you know I hate

184
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,160
javascript thing for a past couple of

185
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,190
years or past many years actually

186
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,329
javascript has played is this really

187
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:32,270
important role in augmenting older

188
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,480
browsers with features and technologies

189
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,160
that the newer browsers were

190
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,380
implementing natively they had it an

191
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,300
older browsers you now didn't have it

192
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,329
people using javascript to kind of like

193
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:47,600
shoe horn all these new technologies and

194
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,560
techniques into the older browsers and

195
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,870
it's it mostly about html5 and CSS

196
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,850
features were seized as three features

197
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,910
in particular newer browsers have been

198
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,320
adding these for the past couple of

199
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,399
years other browsers in particular

200
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,740
mostly just internet explorer they've

201
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,240
been around for years without really

202
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,430
adding any of these features so people

203
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,579
have had to rely on JavaScript to add

204
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,420
them and that able so that web

205
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,829
developers could actually use these

206
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,870
technologies take advantage of them but

207
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,339
it wasn't it wasn't the greatest

208
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,339
situation I mean can anyone here guess

209
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,750
how many

210
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,050
javascript libraries exist to do rounded

211
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:44,370
corners in internet explorer anyone

212
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:50,660
you're all so shy oh sorry well the

213
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,830
funny thing is no matter what number you

214
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,600
say the answer is wrong because the

215
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,490
right answer should is there shouldn't

216
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:01,820
be any I mean you can ask Dion he was

217
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,170
complaining yesterday about how many

218
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,840
posts here to write to a Jackson about

219
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,200
this there shouldn't be any at all zero

220
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,760
that's what it should be so I'm going to

221
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,930
tell you something that I'm you probably

222
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:23,420
either already agree with or you're on

223
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,640
the fence of this issue or you haven't

224
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,470
really decided yet or you're actually

225
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,630
again set and it is this a website

226
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,750
should not look and work the exact same

227
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:41,480
in every browser it's it's it's

228
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,240
basically the principle of similar

229
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,760
versus the same it's very simple matter

230
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,790
actually first one is good the second

231
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,670
will make your head hurt especially in

232
00:11:52,670 --> 00:12:00,290
that in today's browser landscape now if

233
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,550
anyone disagrees with that notion that a

234
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,860
website should not look the same and

235
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,680
that in fact it should give it time

236
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,450
you'll come around eventually

237
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,400
your first realization will be websites

238
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,920
cannot look the exact same in every

239
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,340
browser I mean you can make a one page

240
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,710
single image website if you can still

241
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,460
call that a website and even then the

242
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,990
different color profiles between

243
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,080
browsers means it won't actually be the

244
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,180
exact same it may behave the same

245
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,390
because it's an image but this is an

246
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,310
extreme example it's not very realistic

247
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,160
at all and that's the closest you'll

248
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,050
ever be able to get to a website that is

249
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,570
the exact same in every browser if you

250
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,250
have a much more realistic website with

251
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,190
you not text and well not you'll note

252
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,160
he'll discover very soon that text

253
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,540
rendering and tax time in between mac OS

254
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,040
10 windows and linux very different

255
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,210
dramatically different can't even

256
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,330
possibly get a deep Zac same on top of

257
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,240
that process will never implement the

258
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,830
exact same set of features as one

259
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,190
another and even if they were I mean

260
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,770
even between up round windows and up

261
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,650
around the mac for instance they will

262
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,090
never have the exact same set of bugs so

263
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,610
the various combinations and

264
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,770
permutations of browsers implementations

265
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,640
bugs and features means a website just

266
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,470
simply cannot be the exact same in every

267
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,300
browser and now I mean yesterday

268
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,310
Francisco Tomas key spoke about image

269
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,930
sprites and how cappuccino the Arab does

270
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,640
horizontal sprites and vertical sprites

271
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,860
and dynamic sprites now sprites are a

272
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,280
great way to optimize your website but

273
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,590
you can overdo it for instance jcrew.com

274
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,410
I mean I'm pretty sure everyone here is

275
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,510
at least familiar with jquery calm and

276
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,850
knows the website and recognizes the

277
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,820
who's using jquery section where they

278
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,530
have a bunch of logos of all these

279
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,630
really big name companies that are using

280
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,030
it and that's great and they're using a

281
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,690
CSS image sprite to do the little hover

282
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,100
when you go with your mouse over logo

283
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,500
it'll you know it becomes fully opaque

284
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,190
instead of semi-transparent and shifts

285
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,089
down a pixel they're using a lot of CSS

286
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,740
rules to accomplish that effect and

287
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,540
they're using a sprite that has both

288
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,069
states of of each logo in there and

289
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:45,660
that's you know clearly that's not the

290
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,389
most efficient way but well yeah it does

291
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:52,620
work in internet explorer but uh I every

292
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,079
wrote this well you know just that

293
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,139
little part and oh actually I can show

294
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:10,769
it briefly and I move this over so I

295
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:13,529
this is a local file basically just

296
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:17,100
jQuery calm but with with my changes and

297
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,899
you know it behaves the exact same

298
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,600
there's a subtle fade in and out on each

299
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,449
logo if you hover over them it's it's

300
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:29,250
very subtle but you can you can tell the

301
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,810
difference it's not just an on/off

302
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,819
switch it's now it's it's a little

303
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:36,120
gradual impression slightly richer

304
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,529
experience but the funny thing is doing

305
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,740
this it allowed me to use about

306
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,930
thirty-five percent less CSS to

307
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,149
accomplish the same effect the same

308
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:49,800
effect which then gave me more control

309
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,009
and more freedom over it because now I

310
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:54,899
mean I can do whatever I want with these

311
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,550
logos I can you know skilled and move

312
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,470
them around 3d space have them animate

313
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,160
or whatever and I couldn't do that with

314
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,100
just the background position in the

315
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,350
surprise and not just it's not just that

316
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,380
there's you know less CSS more freedom

317
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,720
more controlled experience it's also

318
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,060
much less maintenance work if you ever

319
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,399
have to update the sprite with logos add

320
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,170
one or you delete one or you know you

321
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,930
change one just to rebrand it you don't

322
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,720
have to make two copies of the logo all

323
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,110
the time you only have the one copy the

324
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,079
only difference is between my version

325
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,959
and the one on jcrew.com is that by

326
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,170
default it doesn't work in

327
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,170
explore it you mean you just don't get

328
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,399
the automatic Faden hover state and even

329
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,600
that hovers that you could implement

330
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,380
with a one-line CSS filter for internet

331
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,800
explorer that's probably worth it

332
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,480
something more extensive I would say not

333
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,769
really worth it but yeah this is this is

334
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,070
a lot it's more efficient cleaner code

335
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,750
it's more powerful and half as much

336
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,280
maintenance especially going forward

337
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,439
it'll be a lot easier where's my cursor

338
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,880
so why do well why do clients and

339
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,429
companies still expect that their

340
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:24,520
website will be the exact same in every

341
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,160
browser and what do i do they they think

342
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,140
that makes sense well because design

343
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,990
agencies and developers don't tell them

344
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,970
that it can't really be done and more

345
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,320
importantly it shouldn't even be

346
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,350
attempted it's much better to focus on

347
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,919
providing good rich experiences and

348
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,770
proper web accessibility then spending a

349
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,360
lot of time using you know little

350
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,210
augmentation tools and trying to get

351
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,010
things to work the exact same or be

352
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,799
pixel perfect a lot of time spent on

353
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,320
that for very little actual gain in the

354
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,200
experience and I mean there are a

355
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,330
thousand and one permutations of every

356
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,760
single website on the entire world wide

357
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,450
web out there and your life will just be

358
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,720
so much easier if you can convince your

359
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,000
employers or your clients or your

360
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,990
designers that you know the website will

361
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,809
have a million-in-one permutations just

362
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:22,120
the same no matter what you do it's just

363
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,070
this just so many in the browser

364
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,610
landscape that you can't control so it's

365
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:34,790
better not to spend a lot of time on it

366
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,720
oh yeah so uh html5 css3 getting back to

367
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,380
a JavaScript there's some there's been

368
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,510
this trend that's been emerging with

369
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,590
that an increased availability of actual

370
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,440
native implementations of html5 and css3

371
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,910
in browsers and and thereby reducing the

372
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,000
need for and the interest in JavaScript

373
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,400
driven augmentation libraries and

374
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,080
toolkits and this is a very good thing

375
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,270
this dis Trant actually is is one of the

376
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,770
main reasons that came up with the idea

377
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,320
from modernizer in the first place

378
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,590
because you know browsers can do a lot

379
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,930
of really cool stuff nowadays and they

380
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,670
can do it without having to rely on

381
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,860
JavaScript which means you know you can

382
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,890
spend time on other things and being

383
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,330
more innovative with JavaScript and

384
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,060
being more creative with it and and take

385
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,580
advantage of these really cool features

386
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,350
I mean let's look at them rounded

387
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:47,100
corners yes excitement is palpable fun

388
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,900
facebones this is actually that actually

389
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,270
is quite exciting browsers are now

390
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,120
starting to have very good solid support

391
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,780
for font face ones in them natively so

392
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,370
you don't have to rely on siffering and

393
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:05,250
or q fun as much anymore canvas very

394
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,830
powerful drawing RGB a color something

395
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,360
actually really like because I like

396
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,140
transparency in nice solo uses thereof

397
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,660
border image very powerful to do to make

398
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,540
use of that box shadow you no html5

399
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,810
audio and video since as animation CSS

400
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,110
transitions to the transformations you

401
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,580
know CSS gradients SVG geolocation

402
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,030
ceases columns local storage web workers

403
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,890
offline web apps and so on and so on

404
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,500
that one now many of these were actually

405
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,410
mentioned by a by Remy yesterday so it's

406
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,240
very clear that a lot of really cool

407
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,680
stuff is happening in

408
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,010
in this space but of course not if your

409
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,740
browser supports it yet that's where

410
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,750
previously you know JavaScript came in

411
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,330
as I already mentioned and it was used

412
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,170
to augment these older browsers with

413
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,790
really just approximations of the same

414
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,640
thing somewhere quite good somewhere

415
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,460
really good many of them were just okay

416
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,430
and most of them were pretty messy and

417
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,360
convoluted more importantly none of them

418
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,850
stacked up against the actual native

419
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,240
implementations and the browsers that do

420
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,340
have them so this situation this

421
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,290
situation can force browse what

422
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,910
developers to to make a choice do I

423
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,950
start using native implementations and

424
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,990
ignore browsers that don't have them or

425
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,610
continue playing it safe with

426
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,880
augmentation methods now that's a bridge

427
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,730
that every web developer web developer

428
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,070
will have to cross at one point in his

429
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,280
or her career for some the the chasm

430
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,880
below is much deeper than for others so

431
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,330
there's no clear indication on when

432
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,810
exactly you should cross this bridge or

433
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:02,100
how for that matter but in order to aid

434
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,980
people making this choice that's kind of

435
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,150
where I came up with with moderniser so

436
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,650
let's look at that moderniser is as one

437
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,930
of this kind of like example situations

438
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,760
where if I don't like the options that I

439
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,650
have available to me in doing something

440
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,400
I just create another one kind of go out

441
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
of the way and figure out what can I do

442
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,440
and said and I mean I really wanted to

443
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,690
use these native implementations of cool

444
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,040
html5 and css3 stuff but I also wanted

445
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,990
to have a really easy way to accommodate

446
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,620
the older browsers and in other words I

447
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,290
wanted it to be super easy for me to use

448
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,600
the cool stuff and have multiple levels

449
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,380
of supports in each website that I built

450
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,120
one for each degree of sophistication

451
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,590
that a browser had and so that's how I

452
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,010
ended up with moderniser

453
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,950
which what it does is it allows you to

454
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,430
use or start using html5 and css3 today

455
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,730
it allows you to have full control over

456
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,890
what your HTML your CSS and your

457
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,030
JavaScript do in browsers that may not

458
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,660
have the more advanced features yet and

459
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,880
that level support staff area like

460
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,320
random and vary chaotically in the lands

461
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,530
across the landscape so and that

462
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,660
actually brings me to kind of the most

463
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,360
important part of this presentation Dada

464
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:45,910
feature detection I did not pay for that

465
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:51,040
slogan no royalty fee feature detection

466
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,830
is cannibal is an incredibly important

467
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,320
technique going forward in particular in

468
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,790
the world of html5 and css3 where this

469
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,310
technique is far less widely used I mean

470
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,350
you're all jobs for people you probably

471
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,780
know this as object detection and have

472
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,450
used this for years we're now in your

473
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,210
scripts you first detect the presence of

474
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,900
a function or method or our property

475
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,000
before you start using it so and thus

476
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,920
preventing errors and warnings from

477
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,580
being thrown well the same technique can

478
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,710
be used to feature detects the

479
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,140
availability of native implementations

480
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:35,350
in browsers for html5 and css3 and it's

481
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,020
it's a really powerful and very

482
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,660
important technique moderniser just does

483
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,960
pretty much that and nothing else it

484
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,400
does a whole bunch of feature detection

485
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,810
and then it's test no not everything but

486
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,880
almost everything that's currently

487
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,370
implemented in at least one browser from

488
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,060
html5 and css3 and then what it does it

489
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,400
tests the weather the features

490
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,470
implemented correctly and then tells you

491
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,510
as a web developer in the current

492
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,660
browser you have this feature you do not

493
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,010
of this feature you have this feature

494
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,010
you do not let this feature and it also

495
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,630
creates a JavaScript object that allows

496
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,760
you to just you know use that in your

497
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,410
scripts and for cure code based on

498
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,550
whether or not the browser has certain

499
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,520
features implemented so it's it allows

500
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,120
you to do very clean for king of all of

501
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,270
your code your HTML CSS and JavaScript

502
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,350
depending on what the pressure can

503
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,760
actually do and what account so it's

504
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,160
kind of a simple example of you know if

505
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,330
you have a native implementation

506
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,650
available there will be class at it

507
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,300
called fun face and you can do use some

508
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,910
cool custom font or if the browser

509
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,220
doesn't have it added you can you have

510
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,710
the no font face rule and use some

511
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,020
fallback if you want or not even that I

512
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,960
mean that's up to you but the important

513
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,170
thing is you have full control over what

514
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,240
you do and don't do for browsers that

515
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,820
don't have these features and this very

516
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,470
fine control mix makes it a lot easier

517
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,720
to actually start taking advantage of

518
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,010
all these really cool stuff so let's

519
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,490
look at a small demonstration of how how

520
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,950
this works or how how can be implemented

521
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,990
yeah so have a virgin my website here

522
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,620
come on all right so this is this in

523
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,400
Safari which I can see so this is in

524
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,630
Safari you'll just have to take my word

525
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,510
on it but you'll see pretty quickly that

526
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,160
it is and you can see here on these tabs

527
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,620
that's all just CSS there's no

528
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,780
JavaScript at all involved besides

529
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,880
moderniser running at the start of the

530
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,850
page and this is just a bunch of CSS

531
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,610
rule saying like hey I on hover State I

532
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,180
want it to be 15 pics wider and I want

533
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,610
to have this move out a little I want to

534
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,150
have the color become fully opaque you

535
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,600
know change the text color of course

536
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,040
that doesn't work quite the exact same

537
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:23,029
way in in other browsers but

538
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,919
so this is Firefox coming in now in

539
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,960
Firefox you know Firefox doesn't do

540
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,660
everything that Safari does and vice

541
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,090
versa but it does support a lot of stuff

542
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,590
it supports rounded-corners sports

543
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,890
box-shadow sports rgba so you can see

544
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:46,000
that better than this one it just

545
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,059
doesn't animate well if I wanted to like

546
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:51,340
you just say like well I don't have

547
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,590
native implementations for CSS

548
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,630
transitions but hey I can use this

549
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,429
JavaScript library to do it anyway so i

550
00:27:57,429 --> 00:27:59,110
can just animate it as i go with

551
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,140
javascript i chose not to do that I'm

552
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,299
fine with offering dis experience to

553
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:08,169
Firefox kind of making a point but it's

554
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:10,720
very easy to add a little bit of

555
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,169
richness with JavaScript depending on

556
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:17,080
what the browser can't do here and then

557
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:24,039
let's look at opera now we have right

558
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,090
here opera me another thing you can see

559
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,860
is that this is not only one column

560
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,720
whereas in Firefox and in Safari it's

561
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,110
two columns that's just done in CSS and

562
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,610
opera just doesn't have support CSS

563
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,460
columns so mama I didn't bother doing

564
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,169
some JavaScript implementation for that

565
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:47,799
I mean really it's not that important

566
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,900
it's just part of blog post content

567
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,690
opera doesn't do a rounded corners as

568
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,240
you can see doesn't quite look the same

569
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,520
but you know what it's not that bad and

570
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,460
I I was ok with this I kind of like that

571
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,090
implementation certainly much easier to

572
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,610
do this then creating images with

573
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,409
rounded corners for all of these tabs in

574
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:11,230
different colors and you know they also

575
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,179
wouldn't allow me to transition them in

576
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:15,850
Safari so that would have given me much

577
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,340
less freedom much more stuff to download

578
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,530
as a you on the user side you know I

579
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,850
have to download all those images and

580
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,610
just for a bunch of rounded corners yeah

581
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,429
not worth it so to me this was very much

582
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:30,490
an acceptable solution to opera and for

583
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,980
upper users I also kind of pointed out

584
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,580
that you know opera really needs to

585
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,960
get their together and start

586
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,940
implementing some of these css3 things

587
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,309
and not just make promises that yes it's

588
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:43,279
in the next build that we know you know

589
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,529
not show to people sorry I kind of you

590
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:51,710
know I'm annoyed with opera sometimes no

591
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,179
offense to all my friends at opera but

592
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:56,870
yeah it's disappointing and internet

593
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,519
explorer I'm not going to show it to you

594
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:01,610
is now p.m. and all that stuff but in an

595
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,529
explorer what I'm doing in in exports is

596
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:06,140
I'm not even moving it out I'm just

597
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,210
letting it be a hover state in the

598
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,159
middle because in and explore doesn't do

599
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,470
rgba so it doesn't show you that nice

600
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,260
little subtle transparency and the

601
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,159
see-through on the edge so it just won't

602
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:21,130
look quite as nice anymore that way

603
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,470
opera at least does and within the next

604
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,240
four it just changes color and that's it

605
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,429
pretty pretty simple but good enough

606
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,159
experience for IE users don't not used

607
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,940
to great stuff anyway I mean after all

608
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:46,820
they use ie so it's you know it's great

609
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,399
having all these cool html5 and css3

610
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:53,179
features available to you but kind of

611
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:55,279
becomes this question you know what do

612
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,110
you have available and what don't you

613
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,029
have available and in which browsers do

614
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,380
you have it available and which browsers

615
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,970
don't you have it available well who

616
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,029
here does not know this website when can

617
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,600
I use oh yeah she shouldn't have put up

618
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,950
your hand because now I'm gonna rant at

619
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,139
you for not the way this website it is

620
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:14,360
really really useful website it's

621
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,889
something you really need to know you

622
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:17,539
need to like bookmark this make it your

623
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:20,210
startup page for your browser go there

624
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,080
for a week explore it you know it's a

625
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,789
really good website it has this

626
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:28,820
incredibly detailed list is a massive

627
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,340
overview every single feature out of

628
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,539
html5 and css3 cross-reference to every

629
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:37,460
browser that has some semblance of

630
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,980
support for it and any browser that is

631
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,840
currently publicly available that makes

632
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,299
sense to include and it allows you to

633
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:47,299
see exactly you know what's currently

634
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:48,169
implemented

635
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:50,509
where is the next browser for this

636
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,279
particular browser coming and is it

637
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,899
going to have an implementation for this

638
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:56,359
feature or is it not it's a really

639
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,820
fantastic website and you all should go

640
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,409
there like as soon as this presentation

641
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:04,399
is over so let's say let's talk about

642
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,580
some things not to do well you don't

643
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,109
want to dress up as a storm trooper in

644
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:11,450
30 degree weather stand out in the Sun

645
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,950
all day and certainly not as a second

646
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,019
you know not an original trilogy storm

647
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:22,649
trooper I mean that's just disgraceful

648
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:25,609
also very important how you don't want

649
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:28,309
to do user agent sniffing and you really

650
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:30,259
don't want to use it you really don't

651
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:32,600
want to use a chat you ah you really

652
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,850
don't want to do user agent sniffing but

653
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,629
I really don't want you to be doing any

654
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:40,609
user agent sniffing because use you a

655
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:43,609
sniffing is a really bad practice and

656
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:46,519
it's I mean it's very unreliable it

657
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,799
breaks usability for a lot of people who

658
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,570
have done nothing wrong except just you

659
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,769
know try and use your website and is the

660
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:56,330
main reason we have this really

661
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,249
ridiculous Internet Explorer mess right

662
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:00,609
now and I mean Douglas Crockford

663
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:03,859
mentioned yesterday that Microsoft you

664
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:05,809
know they couldn't really fix a lot of

665
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:09,440
the issues in IE for ie8 not entirely

666
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,179
true there was a way for them to do that

667
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:12,679
but you know of course they wouldn't

668
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,779
because they wouldn't have control

669
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:18,200
anymore but yeah user agent sniffing is

670
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,779
the main reason that we currently have

671
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,169
this absolutely dreadful intolerable

672
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,970
mess with internet explorer in the world

673
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,809
and i really want everyone to stop doing

674
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:32,869
that so if you if you do that if you're

675
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:34,899
still using that technique please stop

676
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:37,429
get get it out of all the scripts that

677
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:39,799
you have filter it out replace it do

678
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,659
objective tection do feature detection

679
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:44,029
instead and get rid of those things it's

680
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:46,669
very unreliable kind of breaks the web

681
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:50,809
it's really bad and I was originally

682
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:54,529
going to show so don't do it just don't

683
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:57,649
do that so I was already going to show a

684
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:00,290
big table here that would kind

685
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,600
like highlight and explain this mess of

686
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,170
Internet Explorer with ie8 the rendering

687
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,750
engines in I ate how the price will

688
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,090
identify itself depending on what kind

689
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,590
of markup you were using what kind of

690
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,960
HTTP header see we're sending out what

691
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,030
kind of domain you were on you know

692
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,380
whether your domain was blacklisted by

693
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,230
Microsoft or not and that table became

694
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,880
so big that I couldn't fit it in a slide

695
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,040
anymore at any kind of reasonable font

696
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,669
size so instead yeah it was really

697
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:32,570
really messy really big instead I sum it

698
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,380
up in a quote you can have the ie8

699
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,080
rendering engine in a browser

700
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:46,310
identifying as ie7 and vice versa yeah

701
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:52,460
think about that if that doesn't sound

702
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,910
frustrating to you imagine that adding

703
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,940
to that complexity ie9 doing the same

704
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,740
thing and thus offering ie8 i9n ie7 as

705
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,720
rendering engines in browsers

706
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,460
identifying possibly as I 708 or ie9 and

707
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,020
all other possible combinations thereof

708
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,690
don't do browser sniffing please it's

709
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,420
it's so bad built your code based off of

710
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,520
feature detection and object detection

711
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,360
and sell the ID to your employers or

712
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,400
your clients that websites just should

713
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,220
not look and act the exact same across

714
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,830
every browser because that's kind of the

715
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,810
source of it all so don't just do this

716
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:42,170
because I say so I mean it's great if

717
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,870
you listen to me but now do this because

718
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:49,280
of these real-world benefits you'll have

719
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,960
a shorter development time you'll have

720
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,260
much cleaner and clearer code you'll

721
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,930
have much lower maintenance overhead as

722
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,110
you go you know if as time passes and

723
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,910
you have the website and other people

724
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,530
may need to get on board and start

725
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,080
working with it your maintenance will go

726
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,260
way below or way down and all that

727
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,150
translates to lower costs and for

728
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,789
because time is money and so these are

729
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:17,160
very important real world benefits that

730
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,250
you get from not doing you a sniffing

731
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,960
and doing object and feature detection

732
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,990
in your code and just kind of like doing

733
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,319
things the right way it's not just the

734
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,150
right way though it's it's also just a

735
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,210
smart and cost-effective way and I

736
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,589
should make a small mode here that

737
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:36,750
shorter development time you you may not

738
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,490
see that like right away when you start

739
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,490
doing this but once you get more

740
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,079
familiar with these principles and these

741
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,079
techniques and how everything works you

742
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,170
become a lot more accustomed to the

743
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,480
approach and you'll become much more

744
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,539
efficient over time and very pretty soon

745
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:56,190
on you'll be much more efficient than

746
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:00,519
you were before you started doing this

747
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:03,000
so let's say let's take a step back and

748
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,910
look at the bigger picture the bigger

749
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,279
picture of you know the JavaScript

750
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:11,309
landscape or the Grand Canyon escape in

751
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:13,619
this case we have you know we have all

752
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,420
these things like moderniser all the

753
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,369
cool stuff in html5 css3 and these are

754
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:22,770
all very big influences in what's

755
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,510
transforming the JavaScript landscape

756
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,730
but they're also not the only things

757
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,640
going on I mean we have other examples

758
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,670
are these great frameworks that have

759
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,430
been popping up in recent times and by

760
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,079
recent times I mean like the past couple

761
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:39,869
of years two of them i want to give some

762
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:42,390
particular mention here the first is

763
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,140
proud court which has already been

764
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,250
mentioned a couple times at this

765
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,250
conference it's probably most well known

766
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,710
for being the javascript framework that

767
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,900
powers to mobileme web applications at

768
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,529
me calm sprout curve basically allows

769
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:00,930
you to use javascript to do or to build

770
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,210
desktop like applications in the browser

771
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:06,119
and it's gone through an enormous amount

772
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,910
of development in the past year and by

773
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,380
now it's become very refined very

774
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,220
powerful similar to that is cappuccino

775
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,049
the makers of which are here this

776
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:19,470
weekend's I take it you all saw their

777
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,069
talk yesterday here today is conf if you

778
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:25,060
missed it that's a shame

779
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,470
cappuccino is very similar to sprout

780
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,020
birds basically the objective-c runtime

781
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,359
and objective-c is like the mac

782
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:35,450
applications framework or not entirely

783
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,960
but it's like objective-c runtime

784
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,910
implemented in JavaScript I like I do a

785
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,440
poor job of explaining it so i really

786
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,849
hope you caught their session yesterday

787
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:46,190
because it's some seriously cool stuff

788
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,319
that's going on in the JavaScript

789
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:51,530
landscape there's a there's even more

790
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,960
going on but we're kind of starting to

791
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,760
get way past the scope of this

792
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,940
presentation so all these cool new

793
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,500
developments in the world josh cribbs

794
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,069
you know the changing kind of my my my

795
00:39:07,069 --> 00:39:10,099
opinion on Josh of itself and I'm

796
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,849
starting to hate it less and less and

797
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:15,560
you know maybe someday I'll not even

798
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,560
hated at all since you guys already

799
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,390
don't hate it and probably quite like it

800
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,339
I mean you're here at the JavaScript

801
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:25,060
conference I hope you use these tools

802
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,990
use them well use them responsibly and

803
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,670
that you'll just make really exciting

804
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,950
things and spend less time trying to

805
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,700
polish things for internet explorer

806
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,880
because it's not really worth it and

807
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,859
that's kind of all I have for today and

808
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:49,210
I I reckon we go get some lunch well oh

809
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,119
really huh what time is it um but it's

810
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,150
not shine well anyhow nonetheless lunch

811
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:04,190
