1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:12,450

um my name is Thomas Tyner um you can

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,260
see my contact details on the slide and

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,480
today I want to talk about how you can

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,450
pirate the semantic web using javascript

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,610
very quick introduction of my person I

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,919
work as a research scientist at Google

7
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:31,290
Hamburg left a google before in a

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,050
different role um maybe some of you have

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,470
seen me at the google developer days

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,920
i've toured all around europe in 2008

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,879
and the google developer dies will come

12
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,190
back this year in munich so if you're

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,929
interested in joining the google

14
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,090
developer days speak to me after the

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,089
talk again in the invitation code so

16
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:56,940
yeah the chance is high that you get in

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,530
with them yeah what I do at Google will

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,629
I'm research scientists working on a PhD

19
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,590
around the Semantic Web multimedia

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,750
semantics so currently I've submitted a

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,860
paper for the I eswc conference in

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,200
Shanghai represent a JavaScript

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,860
application that is able of yeah finding

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,190
objects and entities in YouTube videos

25
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,340
and yeah I want to present this in

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,830
Shanghai so myself I won't be at the

27
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,870
Google developer day in Munich because I

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,120
will be in Shanghai then but not you

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,280
will meet multi-day so yet another

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,290
reason to attend yeah and about all I'm

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,240
showing here today is bleeding edge

32
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,800
research so this is really something you

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,500
and about this talk to sponsor talk but

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,540
no fear this won't be marketing blah

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,630
blah but please do use google chrome so

36
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,100
that's about the only marketing message

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,850
I'm sending out today and yeah this type

you will learn today hopefully

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
um I got a couple of free the great

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,570

great surprise day at their back with a

49
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,230
little bit of luck so let's get started

50
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,000
hiding the web so not this meant to be a

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,880
Semantic Web hiring the web things you

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,040
can pirate on the web I give me a little

53
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,930
bit of time to read the comics because

54
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,709
here it's actually one of my favorite

55
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,540
thanks you can parent on the web audio

56
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:56,310
books hands if you have read the comic

57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,120
all right let's write a little bit more

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,810
all right so um if you want to have a

59
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,840
collection tired them or I think that's

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,060
really important phrase down there

61
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,160
demand your M free stuff so if you hire

62
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,900
an mp3's you're actually downloading

63
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,420
communism so a lot of people have seen

64
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,920
this is really old comics but still I

65
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,239
really like them another thing that you

66
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,660
can part on on the web movies yeah and

67
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,060
one of the things I really love or XKCD

68
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,410
is you see the comic but on what some

69
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,720
people don't know if your mouse over you

70
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,560
can also see a message and yeah like

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:51,670
next book that's particular funny can i

72
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,380
flip to the next side alright thanks

73
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,170
again paired on the web images but this

74
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,480
is really alingo um you can see this is

75
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,940
from getty images um I went there

76
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,280
yesterday it's lukas podolski prints

77
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,920
poorly as we call him in germany great

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,870
football player or soccer player as the

79
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,660
Americans say

80
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,600
I think you can see it on the slides but

81
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,060
I have maybe you can see there's a

82
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,970
watermark in the image this is really

83
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,310
highly illegal but it did here I've

84
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,590
tired it this image so now we come into

85
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,630
the interesting part how can the

86
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,150
Semantic Web help not tired things but

87
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,280
you know making sure that you don't

88
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,560
pirate things so easily so I want to

89
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,810
start with a bit of an interaction what

90
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,960
is the Semantic Web so um I assume most

91
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,480
of you have a very wake level of

92
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,910
knowledge so I'm really going into the

93
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,890
details but not too deep just deep

94
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,230
enough that you can follow the talk so

95
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,860
first of all bonus web well the web is

96
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,300
the web as you know what it's document

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,820
it slings it you know JavaScript me this

98
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,210
kind of things the Semantic Web however

99
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,180
is there a set of techniques that you

100
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,190
can apply to the web as we know it today

101
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,220
and basically on the you need the cable

102
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:23,100
hey you go yeah that's a problem so um

103
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,280
using the Semantic Web and we can enable

104
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,919
giving meaning to things and I will show

105
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,180
you how this looks like in a second here

106
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,560
in this slide you can see two phrases

107
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,720
one is I love internet and the second

108
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,970
one is I hard the internet so the

109
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,280
meaning of this phrase is exactly the

110
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,640
same the thing is the syntax has changed

111
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,020
that semantics still are the same so in

112
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,610
the Semantic Web it's all about giving

113
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,110
meaning to things html5 defines a

114
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,010
computer-readable syntax so yeah it's

115
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,490
you know image of a bunny with a pancake

116
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,370
on its head and you can see image blah

117
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,300
blah jpg but there's no meaning it's

118
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,760
just an image um you don't know what is

119
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,300
on the image or in the image so yeah

120
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:15,920
it's

121
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,640
meaningless more or less and now on

122
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,980
semantic web you can apply a meaning to

123
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,450
it so you can say this is an image and

124
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,550
on that image you got a funny man funny

125
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,120
bunny with a pancake on his head and if

126
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,610
you're browsing whatever search engine

127
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,170
that you prefer search for oolong if you

128
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,030
love this money you will find a couple

129
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,090
of really interesting photos approved

130
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,230
for all audiences so no worries yeah so

131
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,540
getting meaning to things saying well

132
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,400
this is an image but on this image I

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,140
have runny with a pancake on his head in

134
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,110
the romantic web it's all about triples

135
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,200
triples are basically a subject

136
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,960
predicate object object sorry so

137
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,560
javascript has good part who of you

138
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,730
agrees with that okay that's a good

139
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,460
question to ask you this conference that

140
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,010
was kept as bad part stop as Crawford in

141
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,180
here because people will not necessarily

142
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,020
agree on the bad parts but whatever so

143
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,550
this is just an example triple

144
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:31,100
javascript has good part so now let's go

145
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,450
a bit a little bit into real-world usage

146
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,280
you can see the object in this case is

147
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,180
yet another XKCD comic I give you a bit

148
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,650
of time to read the comic before I

149
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,100
continue it's probably pretty small but

150
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,280
it was released I think on on friday

151
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,680
night i finished few slides on friday

152
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,550
night for am so yeah this was just the

153
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,830
latest XKCD back then so yeah you can

154
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,080
see well this is an image you can see

155
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,210
the predicate is well it has a license

156
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,900
and then you can see the object which is

157
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,050
in this case the Creative Commons 2.5

158
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,310
what's the exact name I'm not really

159
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,010
sure so share remix attribution and

160
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,700
non-commercial license so basically this

161
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,100
license says well let you get this image

162
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
you can share

163
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,440
which I'm doing today and you can remix

164
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,200
it which i would do if i added a pixel

165
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,950
somewhere here if you attribute it this

166
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,380
is what i did here so i said well it's

167
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,570
not mine i have not created it this is

168
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,720
the URL but very where you can get it

169
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,810
and yeah you may not use it commercially

170
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,990
so I'm not paid for being mia so I guess

171
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,410
this qualifies as non-commercial we use

172
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,980
of this image so I said real world so

173
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,860
let's have a look at the HTML code that

174
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,470
generated this image this is really

175
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,600
coming from side so don't get scared by

176
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,870
the yeah text this is basically the

177
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,779
mouse over text for this image and you

178
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,730
can see well it's an image tag it has a

179
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,750
source tag it has a title it has an alt

180
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,930
attribute and then you can see we get a

181
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,899
link down there that says well it's

182
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,860
linked to a license with the relation of

183
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,399
license so this is already good the

184
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,890
problem is well this license does it

185
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,959
apply to the side where the images

186
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,260
contain so basically it does it apply to

187
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,230
let's go back here does it apply to XKCD

188
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,550
com / blah blah so 797 or does it apply

189
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,540
to just the image itself we don't know

190
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,529
so let's see how using semantic web

191
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,810
technologies and in this case I'm only

192
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,079
talking about rdfa and you can do this

193
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:07,070
so you've probably seen it I've added a

194
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,480
little bit let's highlight it so now

195
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,240
with this about attribute you can see

196
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,300
well we get images XKCD com blah blah

197
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,020
about and then you can see well this is

198
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,480
a license that applies to exactly this

199
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,120
image so you can see this is not really

200
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,339
magic this is just yet another attribute

201
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:33,139
that gets added to the HTML code

202
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,389
and yeah this is basically all what

203
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:38,689
already if a is about so RDF move us has

204
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:42,949
heard of RDF okay yeah this roars

205
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:45,079
description framework a lot of people

206
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:49,309
turn away by if XML is one serialization

207
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:52,040
but for the web people multi-tech use

208
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,699
RDF a which is yeah putting things

209
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:57,589
putting the but the triple information

210
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:00,709
into attributes that's a 4 that's what

211
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,339
the a stands for all ready fa you can

212
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,290
see about in this case it was as easy as

213
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,350
just adding one about attribute to this

214
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,809
tag and here you go now we have exactly

215
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,509
defined well this is the license for the

216
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,790
image not the page but for the image

217
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,839
which in this case could be added to the

218
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,910
side but yeah a lot of people currently

219
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,970
if they use license information have

220
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,160
this kind of license which is which is

221
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,949
already great so basically they say

222
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:36,589
about it you may use the side and by the

223
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:39,199
side most people think of the side and

224
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,029
its components which means the images

225
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:43,610
inside of the site but it starts getting

226
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,100
messy so this kind of technology as soon

227
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,739
as you have a compilation of images from

228
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:50,660
jas code for example imagine I would

229
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,389
want I wanted to generate a page of all

230
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:55,489
the images that i found on flickr from

231
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,110
people that have taken photographs at

232
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,439
jas conf probably you have decided to

233
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:03,619
use CC whatever license we have decided

234
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,660
to keep all your images your own so copy

235
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,749
art by you and some personal a show last

236
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:11,839
row might have decided well they put

237
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,910
their images under GPL or whatever crazy

238
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,730
license a similar to start putting this

239
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,649
page at these images together on one

240
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:22,509
page it starts really getting messy so

241
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:28,329
rdfa so using a technology like this is

242
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:32,179
a great way of yeah making busy that you

243
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:34,279
give the right license to the right

244
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:39,799
images if you're into like doing things

245
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,750
whatever I said right now

246
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,110
compounding images and putting them

247
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,700
together on one side mark Berbick his

248
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,400
website is we backplane com has

249
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,920
introduced some nice techniques how you

250
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,920
can do with such such things for example

251
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,230
compiling five images that have the same

252
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,080
license and not using this about tech on

253
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,850
all of them but just on a container

254
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,180
around these images so a search whatever

255
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,120
search engine you want to search on mark

256
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,440
birbeck rdf rdf a image license and it's

257
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,760
the first link on at least our surgeon

258
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:26,210
alright so another thing about our EF is

259
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,680
tripled and well triple visualization so

260
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,900
this is what you will probably see if

261
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,860
you read a bit about raf a great

262
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,660
document that you can read is from w3c

263
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,240
w3c hard word if we start if you search

264
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,450
for rdf primer you will find a lot of

265
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,710
images like this so you can see well

266
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,960
this is the image again and you can see

267
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,140
it has a cc colon license and I can see

268
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,339
Creative Commons blah blah the URI to to

269
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,310
the to the license so in the Semantic

270
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,400
Web it's all about your eyes because

271
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,250
your eye is unique so it has a unique

272
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,350
identifier on the world and well we as

273
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,540
human beings can interpret what is

274
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,120
behind you rise so it is recommended

275
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,920
recommended to add information add your

276
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,230
eyes that human beings can read can

277
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,480
understand so in this case if I go to

278
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,570
this uri i can read the license and i

279
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,670
can interpret and make sense of it and

280
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,070
well see that this license is about

281
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,830
though i may share i may use it blah

282
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,540
blah but i may not use it commercially

283
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,650
in this kind of things so yeah your eyes

284
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,720
and putting information that is that

285
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,820
makes sense for human beings bhai

286
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,410
these your eyes yeah so this about this

287
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,580
and now well finally we are there

288
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,860
finally we are at javascript London

289
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,740
grade if he could access these turtles

290
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,020
right from within JavaScript so having

291
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,780
things like document dot get elements by

292
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,390
property and say give me all the

293
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,330
elements that are at CC license and then

294
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,310
filter may be on all the CC license

295
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,800
elements that are under GPL for example

296
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,660
you can see the second example here how

297
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,880
about about getting all the triples that

298
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,970
are about a certain subject about this

299
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,080
image wouldn't it be great and well the

300
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,920
rdf a API working group at the w3c is

301
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,040
currently working on a draft for such a

302
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,770
future standards so probably or maybe or

303
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,860
hopefully however you want to put it if

304
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,590
we talk about this again in I don't know

305
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:57,590
say 2012 2015 2011 I don't know maybe

306
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,110
then this will be real all right already

307
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,000
so that you can use document dot

308
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,990
whatever get elements blah blah yeah so

309
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,650
this is currently in draft status so

310
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,870
it's still really early in the in the in

311
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,470
the development phase but yeah you can

312
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,620
already make fun stuff with it like for

313
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,860
example right a Chrome extension that

314
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,890
would add lasers to all the RT to all

315
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,410
the creative commons licensed element

316
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,550
and yeah this is exactly what I did so

317
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:35,330
let's go to the next slide and demo it

318
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,630
with this great XKCD comic this is

319
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,070
really awesome and will give you a

320
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,360
little bit of time to read it I have you

321
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,180
can read it in the last rose my favorite

322
00:16:47,180 --> 00:17:11,049
all-time favorite XKCD

323
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:15,439
the title of this image is I'm an idiot

324
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,350
all right so now let's jump to the demo

325
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:25,589
of this chrome extension rub I open the

326
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,889
page and you can see well yeah this is

327
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:35,220
the page let's check the mouse over so

328
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,769
it says sadly this is a true story at

329
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:40,830
least I learned about the OSX a command

330
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,860
so this is great fun command if you're

331
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,590
on ssh and your acid etching into I

332
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,980
don't know your girlfriend's computer

333
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,220
make it say something great effect a lot

334
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,919
of fun stuff that you can do with it so

335
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,380
yeah let's crawl down a bit to the

336
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,730
actual license and you can see whoa we

337
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,460
got lasers and this is directly stolen

338
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,710
from the Jays comp site but mine is

339
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,590
fading out and fading in so really

340
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,419
awesome I think and you can see this

341
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,480
work is licensed under creative commons

342
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,820
attribution noncommercial 2.5 license

343
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,370
and you can see license information is

344
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,620
fading in and fading out with a laser

345
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,450
effect so this is a lot of fun of course

346
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,639
this is just a demo and just for fun but

347
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:33,120
you can see here a small CC gets about

348
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,190
you can see the mouse cursor probably a

349
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,090
small CC gets added to the how do we

350
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,899
call this tuesday is it magic bar how do

351
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:45,350
we call the address bar in chrome the

352
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:53,059
sorry i don't get an arm

353
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:57,690
harmony bar Carter said well you

354
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,169
understood it I didn't well the our

355
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:08,879
address bar um but why did I say it's

356
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:12,749
really hard to understand omni bar okay

357
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:16,049
right so on the Omni bar you can see it

358
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:18,629
has added a little CC which means that

359
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:21,120
on this page my chrome extension has

360
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,860
found license information and if you

361
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,690
click it you can see that at the moment

362
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,730
it doesn't do anything at all but you

363
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,379
could imagine well you could put in

364
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,029
there a list of all the images and

365
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:36,779
something like a very easy copy and

366
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:39,330
paste mechanism that would be licensed

367
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,830
aware so you could imagine having

368
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,990
something like you copy the image plus

369
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,299
the license information which would

370
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:49,799
enable things like let's jump back to

371
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,190
hear like adding this small corporate

372
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,610
caption that you can see on our my slide

373
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,600
automatically now it's a pain because

374
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,519
you have to create a small text area

375
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,119
copy and paste to license so wouldn't be

376
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,490
great if this would be more or less an

377
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,190
automatic process I'm releasing my

378
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,309
chrome extension after the talk so

379
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,740
whoever wants to have a copy and paste

380
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,499
licenses or sorry license a better copy

381
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:19,830
and paste feel free to play with the ex

382
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,499
engine and add a lot of awesomeness to

383
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:27,360
it um so whoops I'm going to quickly

384
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,679
jump back to here so this really works

385
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,789
and I've seen a fun side that you can

386
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:38,330
test it on which is classic car show

387
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:44,519
calm and it has just well this website

388
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,200
is about classic car ism I have no

389
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,879
interest at all in plastic cards I just

390
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,559
happened to find this page and if you

391
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:56,720
open whatever image you can see lasers

392
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,590
so

393
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,340
it's here the problem is these guys

394
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,650
don't really do it exactly right they

395
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,919
don't apply what we've seen before in

396
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,880
this example they have the license

397
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,610
information within the image but they

398
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,860
haven't done it correctly so whoops if

399
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,940
you happen to know the guys behind

400
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,320
what's the car what's the name classic

401
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,659
car show calm please tell them to fix

402
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:31,260
their RAF but still it's already great

403
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,080
stuff and this works on whatever random

404
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,409
page you want to test it and this is

405
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,990
technology so like adding licenses to

406
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,520
images today that you can test on for

407
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,890
example our search engine if you search

408
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:53,730
for Jas conf images you can see a lot of

409
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,760
fun jas kana images and then you can see

410
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,360
I then can go to advanced search and

411
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,270
filter by license label for commercial

412
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,250
reuse with modification hit Search and

413
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,750
then you can see well this is the images

414
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,169
that we may legally reuse for commercial

415
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:16,950
purposes around Jas conf this is enabled

416
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,289
by this technology because with this

417
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:22,950
info with this details we have so let's

418
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:29,070
open the dojo guys yeah this is fun so

419
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:34,590
let's go to the actual website look so

420
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,250
you can see somewhere here yet some

421
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,909
rights reserved so if I open this you

422
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:43,440
can see well this is under a Creative

423
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,010
Commons license even if on this page

424
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,690
yeah this is just a static HTML page

425
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,149
because it's the old license so you

426
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:55,980
don't see lasers so hopefully if you go

427
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,409
to the new version

428
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,820
no well this is just static HTML so here

429
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,029
we don't have license information but um

430
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:13,859
if let's go here and this is my private

431
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,159
blog nothing really interesting but at

432
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,429
the very end you can see well lasers and

433
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:26,129
if I click on this link your bra you're

434
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:28,859
you're brought to this page and you can

435
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:32,489
see well this is kind of what I'm aiming

436
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:35,580
at you can get automatically created

437
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,789
this is a diff that you should add to

438
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,820
any content coming from my website that

439
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,219
has yeah the license information

440
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:47,129
embedded and you can see here well I'm

441
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:49,469
on this website but this website

442
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,859
suddenly looks like dynamic because it

443
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:55,139
uses the information that comes from the

444
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:57,479
HTTP referer and because we know that

445
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:00,479
well on my website I have placed this

446
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:03,059
special markup that says I'm the owner

447
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,389
please use this in this license for my

448
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:11,159
content all right so let's jump back to

449
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,830
the presentation you can get they get

450
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,039
this extension if you go to bit ly / rdf

451
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:24,089
a laser yeah so you can download it um

452
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,489
the source code comes with the

453
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:28,769
applicable with 3x engine and if you

454
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,059
don't know how to extract the source

455
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:33,450
code from a Chrome extension search the

456
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,889
search engine of your choice for

457
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:37,349
extracting the source code of a Chrome

458
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:42,419
extension or ask me so I said I'm a PhD

459
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,339
student which means I rate a lot of

460
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:46,529
papers and one of the papers i really

461
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,450
recommend if you're interested in this

462
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,749
kind of things with a relatively

463
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:55,309
practical application case go to VIP fee

464
00:24:55,309 --> 00:25:02,129

and so this is the URLs again rdf a

469
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,219
laser have fun with the extension and

470
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,159
yeah as I said please please please do

471
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,669
make a lot of a lot more out of it and

472
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:31,690

surprise that can be yours if you know

474
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:38,679
the answer to this question how automag

475
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:43,599
can you change the volume and tell me

476
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,919
the first response and we got the

477
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,589
awesome awesome awesome streaming client

478
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:54,609
from mounted right open here and the

479
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:57,339
first person that will add reply me the

480
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,469
right response will have this awesome

481
00:25:59,469 --> 00:26:03,039
surfer a surprise back so this is 3 me

482
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,539
real time so let's see who will get the

483
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:10,389
first surprise bag so I believe this

484
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:15,759
open in the background rub and basically

485
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,879
this is my top so I have no idea what

486
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,070
you're talking about so here's an image

487
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,570
from the binding with a baffle in his

488
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,249
head um any questions on this tas or any

489
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:30,549
questions on RTI for whatever semantic

490
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:42,269
web stuff yes please

491
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:55,510
my dominance

492
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,400
yeah so the question was and why why do

493
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,660
I need a specific dome API the thing is

494
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:09,170
in my in my library that has implemented

495
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:14,910
this this API I'm actually using xpath

496
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,130
for for accessing but other the element

497
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,260
the thing is there's a lot more behind

498
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,550
because what my API does or what my API

499
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,130
implementation to us is it can retrieve

500
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,560
the elements but it is not by default

501
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,860
triple aware so it doesn't really get

502
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,380
this this idea of having triplets on the

503
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,190
page it kind of does by simply brute

504
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,380
forcing running over all the notes and

505
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,740
checking well where r triples but by

506
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,600
having this so remember this is

507
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,770
something that we want about that that

508
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,020
people in in this community want to head

509
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,050
to meet native in web browsers so this

510
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,220
is something that can really be

511
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,410
implemented by a safe Firefox a chrome

512
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,340
say what kid so that it would run a

513
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,470
level deeper so not on JavaScript level

514
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,380
but yeah right within the browser and be

515
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,540
really really fast so don't think of it

516
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,350
as being something like a Dom API my

517
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,660
implementation just implements the API

518
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,210
and it's not implemented to be fast it's

519
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,240
not implemented to be something yet that

520
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,270
the end user can use it's more like a

521
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,280
demo of what could be possible with this

522
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:45,419
API let me show you very quickly

523
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:48,710
so this was one of the answers let's see

524
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:57,110
if someone else on streaming I guess

525
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:04,629
Thomas dumb care is the winner so I

526
00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:07,129
think I don't have to sudo though but

527
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:09,739
this is the right response so YouTube

528
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:23,730
loss for Thomas

529
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:30,200
Thanks so sorry you were a little bit

530
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,380
too late yeah that's some fun gadgets in

531
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,190
there nothing really too fancy but yeah

532
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,670
it's not a new film it's not a new

533
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:45,260
android phone sorry for that so yeah I

534
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,750
wanted to show you here we go I wanted

535
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,730
to show you the source code of this

536
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,810
chrome extension so who of you has ever

537
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:57,950
built a Chrome extension a couple of

538
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,240
hands so hopefully after today and after

539
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,310
having seen these slides you will see

540
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,580
that it's not magic it's just JavaScript

541
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,900
this is just my JavaScript so it's

542
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,919
really bad job

543
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,580
so really need JavaScript freaks guards

544
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,409
like you will do a better job on this

545
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:19,980
but yeah even someone like like me can

546
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,759
do it so this is the concept of the

547
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,279
background page where you have the

548
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,289
actual website and then you add with the

549
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:29,970
chrome extension the concept of a

550
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,529
background page to it which is something

551
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,629
like a virtual page it runs in a

552
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:35,489
background that holds the application

553
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:38,100
logic for the chrome extension and you

554
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,519
can see here all that this extension

555
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,269
does is while it waits for a follow

556
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:51,739
request and if a request happens the

557
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:54,359
callback function gets gets fired and

558
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:57,600
you can see well basically it's really

559
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,119
really low-tech if the request thought

560
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,690
show element contains I can I will show

561
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,609
the icon and if not I won't show the

562
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:09,600
icons so the thing is well what where

563
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,489
the surah guys come from and then we

564
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:14,809
have to jump into the content script and

565
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:17,820
if you know grease monkey this is more

566
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,129
or less the same thing so you inject a

567
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,950
script into the actual page and you can

568
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,669
see here this is my API so its name

569
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:29,869
spaced link oops sorry its name spaced

570
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:35,340
link data a link data API so think of

571
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,169
this as document dot but for my really

572
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:43,529
simple implementation yeah I have names

573
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:47,700
vested link data API and then well let's

574
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,179
very quickly see what this does it's at

575
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,850
it sets a namespace mapping so basically

576
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,940
all it does here is it says CC should be

577
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,100
the namespace of Creative Commons blah

578
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,720
blah the URI and then you see the

579
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,460
problem this case it's the DOMA

580
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,509
operations link data API get elements by

581
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:13,259
property license and then restore it in

582
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:17,750
this in this variable

583
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,200
the next step is well some people use

584
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,780
the namespace others don't so we have to

585
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,270
run basically the same thing again but

586
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,360
this time this time with the namespace

587
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,520
and then we put the two together so we

588
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,060
can't get the two arrays and well then

589
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,840
if there are elements that are a CC

590
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,250
license then we basically just fire a

591
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,840
request to the background page and all

592
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,950
this does is it shows the small icon

593
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,960
here so this is the i can i'm talking

594
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,640
about and yeah then you can add whatever

595
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,290
i say before then you could add a lot of

596
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,710
logic here if you click here it opens

597
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,810
what we call the pop-up page of the

598
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,120
chrome extension so background page is

599
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,520
the concept of the application logic

600
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,730
pop-up page is the concept of what

601
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,650
happens inside of this speech bubble and

602
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,930
content script is well the greasemonkey

603
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,520
script that gets injected into the page

604
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,990
so let's jump back to the source code

605
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:34,410
sorry okay yeah well all that happens

606
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:38,150
here is well I just add the magic lasers

607
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,400
that's it more or less so it's just a

608
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,400
couple of lines of JavaScript and Bob

609
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,070
this is just the look and feel of it the

610
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,190
lasers the actual chrome extension is

611
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,920
like I know 10 15 lines of JavaScript

612
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,900
code maybe and well my library runs in

613
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:04,850
the background so it is let's see boobs

614
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,639
this was at the beginning so yeah with

615
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,250
the application with the extension

616
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,889
manifest you have to include this

617
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,669
library and then it can make use of it I

618
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:19,950
think yeah I'm running over time thank

619
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,480
you very much ping me if you have

620
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,639
questions I'm around here and thank you

621
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,659
very much for being here for listening
