1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,709

alright thank you first and foremost

2
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:18,050
welcome everyone it's very glad to see I

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,310
very glad to see so many of you here

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,700
today it's a great honor to be here this

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,449
is actually my second scariest talk the

6
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:28,220
scariest one I've ever had is one in

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,990
Japan where I was live translated into

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,739
Japanese with jokes being 15 seconds

9
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:38,110
later it's horrible so see how this goes

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,190
yeah so this talk is about user

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,070
experience rather it's about all the

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,479
stuff I've learned during the last three

13
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,330
years of building appearing from what

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,210
was essentially a tech demo into what is

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,699
like a successful product or semi

16
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,400
successful product at least so hope it's

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,440
going to be relevant for you as you can

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,799
learn something as well yeah as

19
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,989
mentioned i am logging yeah i am tech

20
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,119
lead in appearing and I've been sort of

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,950
around all over the code base both

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,960
back-end and front-end and I'm also

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,670
doing a lot of the product developments

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,080
and some of the marketing work as well

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,820
it's been very insightful so I always

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,350
have to ask how many of you are familiar

27
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,430
with appearing from before row fans all

28
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,050
right so about twenty percent so that

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,910
means I can go through my introduction

30
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,020
slides basically we are a video chat

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,180
service based in browsers and a mobile

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,920
devices and we're built on something

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,360
called web RTC and we provide what is

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,310
sort of a different user experience and

35
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,900
a different approach to video chatting

36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,170
than what you may have seen before there

37
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,370
are a lot of sources are similar to this

38
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,870
but basically what you do is equal to a

39
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,540
pair of in / anything can be your name

40
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,159
or the name of your company or the name

41
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,580
of your team and you send a thank you

42
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,380
everyone to talk to you and once they

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,930
click it they will appear with high

44
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,180
quality audio and video we don't need to

45
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,250
register no need to download anything it

46
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,500
just works this is sort of a showcase of

47
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,040
the power of the web just let this work

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,740
and we launched back in 2013 as the

49
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,290
first sort of commercial product based

50
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:21,950
on this so we

51
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,660
then having subtraction and learned a

52
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,760
lot about what it means to actually

53
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,560
build products but it all started with

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,440
the interns as many projects do so we

55
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,260
were once like an R&D company inside a

56
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,420
large telecom operator may be doing a

57
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,860
lot of communication apps and every

58
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,330
summer we would have students from

59
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,940
universities that we hired in and we

60
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,830
starting to do projects that were sore a

61
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,239
little bit cool and like you sort of

62
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,190
play around and learn stuff and we were

63
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,860
their mentors and we had this idea we

64
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,080
know that vibrancy was coming we didn't

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,700
know a lot about it other than it was

66
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,349
for peer-to-peer video we wanted to see

67
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:01,910
what we can create with it in addition

68
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,599
we've had a lot of problems with getting

69
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,430
us a nose to work I mean we spent 10

70
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,739
minutes every day trying to just get the

71
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,190
damn thing to work that's very annoying

72
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,590
that is idea that what if it could work

73
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,060
with you just sending a link to someone

74
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,920
and then it just magically worked the

75
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,280
link was sort of the room so this week

76
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,660
so we had three students and we had six

77
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,989
weeks and we have this idea and it was a

78
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:34,910
very ambitious project but the dynastar

79
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,769
feel free to choose the technology such

80
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,870
as how the service looked and how they

81
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,010
worked after two weeks we have our first

82
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,859
demo so he assumes sort of shaking and

83
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,180
we're very ashamed of the things that

84
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,260
are created they showed up there in

85
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,900
front of like 50 people most of them

86
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,569
engineers and showed us something quite

87
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,790
amazing actually we got our minds blown

88
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,380
because they they showed off not only

89
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,329
having one to one video communication

90
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:03,590
where pretend made it work for groups

91
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,319
and this was so good that during the

92
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,060
demo people typing in the URL that we

93
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,980
were using and joining the chat as well

94
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,280
and this was at least in 2013 this was

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,470
yeah mind-blowing nobody had seen

96
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,359
anything like this before and I worked

97
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,950
in chrome stable and later in firefox

98
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,989
and off-brand other demos as well or

99
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,900
other browsers as well so needs to say

100
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,210
excitement was high and was this sort of

101
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,450
early demo I sort of got us into the

102
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,830
idea this can actually turn into a

103
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,409
product so the last four remaining weeks

104
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,729
we get them a designer and we get

105
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,159
some some more feedback and how he can

106
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,389
actually develop this into a product

107
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,490
that we launched and I was the initial

108
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,439
story of how aperion actually came to

109
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,999
and you can recognize a lot from the

110
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,009
service that you saw before and to serve

111
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,900
the day built after six weeks the video

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,759
layouts is mostly the same but the

113
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,249
colors a bit different now and they're

114
00:04:56,249 --> 00:05:00,870
much more functionalities and after the

115
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,809
intern perious was finished we decided

116
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:05,759
we should just launched and this is sort

117
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,899
of in a telecom industry launchers are

118
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,749
measured in millions both in amount of

119
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:14,219
money you spend on how many users you

120
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:15,990
reach but we decided to do something a

121
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,990
bit different and we were luck to do

122
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,550
that because during summer in Norway

123
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,499
there's about this four or five week

124
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:24,120
period of time where all the grown-ups

125
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,089
are on holiday basically so nobody's

126
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:29,069
there to tell you I probably shouldn't

127
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:31,050
do this so you wrote a quick blog post

128
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,759
you posted it on hacker news and read it

129
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,960
because that's how you sort of launch

130
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,330
stuff back in the day or probably not as

131
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,419
well and the feedback we got was just

132
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,209
amazing we got a lot of attention the

133
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,979
same reaction that we got in that first

134
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,499
initial demo and while our service

135
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:47,819
struggled and there were a lot of things

136
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:50,430
we should have done better and we

137
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,550
crashed a lot people in general sort of

138
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,139
saw the ID and we saw that this was

139
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,459
something that we should really put more

140
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,839
focus into that gives me to the first

141
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,300
lesson I overheard a conversation

142
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,860
earlier today about some guy I don't

143
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,020
know his name or wasn't meant to listen

144
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,629
to on a conversation or anything but he

145
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:11,159
wanted to launch its open-source project

146
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,800
no no no I have to it uses require Jess

147
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
so I have to do it in something other

148
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,029
the other thing and it's have to redo de

149
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,889
Pisan that kind stuff that doesn't

150
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,389
matter you should just launched early if

151
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:23,249
you aren't a little bit afraid or a

152
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,330
little bit ashamed of what you're

153
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,330
launching you're watching too late

154
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,999
because the best feedback looking yet is

155
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,770
that actually someone uses your product

156
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,839
they love it and you get motivation from

157
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,969
that and you get prioritization what

158
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:37,620
should actually fix instead of just

159
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,050
sitting there and sort of coding away

160
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,370
and not really know in the direction

161
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,870
that you want to go in and unending up

162
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,779
never launching and if we haven't

163
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,490
launched back then when this was so

164
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,810
fresh we might have never been where we

165
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,200
are today

166
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,170
because we got a lot of attention from

167
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:58,290
being the first mover yeah we had a

168
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,590
rocky first few months we were a bit

169
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,480
lucky to have another project shut down

170
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,070
so we had a lot of engineers to sort of

171
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,720
pick and choose from from day one so we

172
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,600
set up a small team we had like three

173
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,480
redesigns we tried to figure out who we

174
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,880
were and what do you want to be until we

175
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,310
finally thought that we had it we were

176
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,140
going to be the world's biggest web RTC

177
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:26,550
video conferencing service yeah but that

178
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,730
doesn't really work and the middle II we

179
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,020
did get a lot of positive feedback

180
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,330
because we were web RTC based and I was

181
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,040
kind of cool and hip at a time and that

182
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,720
gave us a lot of buzz and initial

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,400
attention another blog post i got those

184
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,940
users but in the end the truth was that

185
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,180
the average user couldn't care less

186
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,650
barberton see simply wasn't important to

187
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,620
them robert c wasn't why people loved us

188
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,710
at least not directly because when it

189
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,690
all came down to it all of these

190
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,130
services work I mean skype facetime

191
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,230
hangouts a messenger they all work for

192
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,090
the average user and most of the

193
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,980
conversations that you have are between

194
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,510
people that you're already connected to

195
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,190
your already taking the investment of

196
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,100
downloading this application setting it

197
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,340
up and it just works for you so what

198
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,810
work is he in itself was not something

199
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,460
that would get us users you have to go

200
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,170
back and sort of figure out what could

201
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,930
we build that was better I figure out

202
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,610
what was the reason prefer people

203
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,470
preferred us over those other much

204
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,910
larger services because you could see

205
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,040
that we were getting users we're getting

206
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,630
attention outside the fact that it was

207
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,740
we're about to see based so we started

208
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,610
looking at what people said oh we got

209
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,870
customer support feedback got Twitter

210
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,820
messages or comments on blog posts and

211
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,490
the same sort of tats has now become

212
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,160
more tagline is no logins no installs

213
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,420
and free for update people and just

214
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,180
share the link it was super easy and

215
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,850
everyone could do it so it was really

216
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,190
the user experience of it all that made

217
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,910
the difference

218
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,610
we are creating something that was

219
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,110
easier and better than the alternatives

220
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,460
and have nothing to do with technology

221
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,810
at least not directly and once we change

222
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,720
focus do that a lot of other people also

223
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,600
started talking about us because we

224
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,010
changed our marketing massive change the

225
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,180
message that we were sending with the

226
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,360
product and then marketing sort of

227
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,640
happened for us because people when

228
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,990
people love your product they will

229
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,580
actually share it to their friends and

230
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,920
they will be the market energy that you

231
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,260
need so user experience is what made us

232
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,020
better but technology was the enabler

233
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,220
and think that's important to remember

234
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,750
for a lot of other stuff as well because

235
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,970
the user doesn't care about technology

236
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,070
and this is true for whether you're

237
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,270
building a product where you're building

238
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,910
a library in the end nobody really cares

239
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,250
if you're using reactor angular behind

240
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,530
the scenes nobody cares what build

241
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,160
system we have spending time building

242
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,650
the product and figuring out what the

243
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,810
product is and how it works it's that

244
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,690
much more important than spending time

245
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,630
for example scaling to 200 million users

246
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,920
without you actually having a product

247
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:23,130
that will do that okay so people loved

248
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,800
us but they weren't coming back that was

249
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,330
a sort of our second issue so we knew

250
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,250
that sort of from the feedback that we

251
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,990
got that we had something that worked

252
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,320
but retention was sort of low this is

253
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,370
pretty common for many other

254
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,950
applications as well after all other

255
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,980
services work just fine and we have this

256
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,200
sort of recurring feedback to us but we

257
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,000
really think your product is the future

258
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,460
but that doesn't really help us we need

259
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,920
users and people now to get funding to

260
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,150
keep going doing this so we have to find

261
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,770
ways to make a product more sticky but

262
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,560
how do you actually do that how do you

263
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,760
find these magical ways that would

264
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,110
actually get people to come back well we

265
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,590
started out small so this is a sign in

266
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,900
Norwegian I'll translate for you it's

267
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,810
the actual song we used around oslo

268
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,700
it's basically said we will buy you

269
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,460
coffee if you spend 15 minutes testing

270
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,070
alternate video chat because we have

271
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,170
this problem where users are global we

272
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,360
had a lot of users everywhere and since

273
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
we didn't have user registration it was

274
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,950
hard to get in touch with them but when

275
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,870
it comes down to it most of you users

276
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,510
are ahead of you so by just going out

277
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,040
there and actually start talking to

278
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,990
people and trying to understand what

279
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,210
their problems are how they use

280
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,480
application today and sort of what they

281
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,370
think about your application or whatever

282
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,100
your building is very very important and

283
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,839
doing something small like this which

284
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,370
isn't perfect it's much better than not

285
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,630
doing anything at all that's the next

286
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,490
lesson we sort of learned was actually

287
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,950
talk to you users because the only your

288
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,890
users know what they need what they want

289
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,810
what their problems are and how your

290
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,060
product can fit in to solve those

291
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,990
problems because creating a cool service

292
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,750
is meaningless if it doesn't solve a

293
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,490
user problem take for example Google

294
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,770
Wave which when it was launched in some

295
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,570
of the coolest tech presentation that

296
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,120
I've seen in my life I mean I don't know

297
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,730
how many actually saw that but it's they

298
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,150
showed off live editing the deafening

299
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,190
thing and it was just whatever google

300
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,550
docs house now they that was it but

301
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,560
google wave in itself did not solve any

302
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,270
user problems i still have problems

303
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,240
describing what google wave walls I so

304
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,280
can't sort of described was it a task

305
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,200
manager was there a collaboration thing

306
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,380
I actually don't know but I took the

307
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,640
technologies that out there and put into

308
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,230
other products but actually solved user

309
00:12:52,230 --> 00:13:02,229
needs like in Google Docs

310
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,859
so I want to talk to you about two ways

311
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:07,859
of getting feedback as well so there's

312
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:09,749
two ways of doing research I do have

313
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,189
quantitative data or you have

314
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:14,970
qualitative data and very often I see

315
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,279
that a lot of people use quantitative

316
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,679
data and only that so you have metrics

317
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,149
and have your funnels and you try to

318
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:23,329
measure all things in your application

319
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:26,069
and that's fine because metrics can tell

320
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:28,499
you what the user does but it will never

321
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:31,679
tell you why so take an example we can

322
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,019
clearly see that we have a high

323
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,939
acquisition like many people come to our

324
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:37,949
page we have high activation they use

325
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:40,350
our product and we can clearly see from

326
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,649
metrics that they don't come back but we

327
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:45,209
don't know why that's where the

328
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,619
qualitative research comes in to

329
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:52,709
actually talking to people so after a

330
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,119
while we sort of grew out to the coffee

331
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:56,249
shop method and we started hitting more

332
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:59,549
complex problems and that's where you

333
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:02,339
set up sort of a proper user testing

334
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,829
session and for us it was very important

335
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:08,339
having include the entire team so that

336
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,869
you have different perspectives on how

337
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:12,379
you solve problems so we SAT together

338
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:15,329
diverse teams of designers a researcher

339
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:17,669
engineer and marketing and they together

340
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,889
worked with talking to users actually

341
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:21,899
being there in the feedback creating

342
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,489
these prototypes together and testing

343
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,199
out the solution when we thought you had

344
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,559
something that worked that really helped

345
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,110
us understand the complete picture of a

346
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,110
problem instead of just having the user

347
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,089
researcher go out get all the answers

348
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,889
and then come back we sort of this is

349
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:39,449
the way we have to solve it then you

350
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:41,279
lose the perspective of example the

351
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,399
designer or the engineer and we make

352
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,379
prototypes to show people sometimes they

353
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:50,939
were on paper sometimes they were in

354
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,769
code we did whatever made sense at the

355
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:55,350
time what took the least effort for us

356
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,109
to do so this is an example of the new

357
00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:01,439
room layout for mobile we tested out

358
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:03,509
where we want to test out if people

359
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:06,209
understood icons with the result text if

360
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,789
they understood the interaction that we

361
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:10,110
want to go and if they understood long

362
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,339
press and that kind of stuff so that was

363
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,009
a combination of both paper prototypes

364
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:14,730
and

365
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:21,990
code implementation right so when you do

366
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,370
reduce your research it needs to sort of

367
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,930
be focused on a target you can't really

368
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,949
go out there and interview everyone and

369
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,380
I see a lot of other application and we

370
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,699
did at ourselves in the beginning we

371
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,079
wanted to make a service for everyone

372
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,540
like that makes sense right we wanted to

373
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,920
make a service big we wanted to have

374
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,839
lots of users so naturally everyone and

375
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,560
their dog has to use us but it doesn't

376
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,529
really work because people have

377
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:51,389
different expectations so let me show

378
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:54,600
you a quick example of that so what do

379
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,529
you think is the difference between

380
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,970
these two users so the girl on the left

381
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,470
she's 18 years old she goes to high

382
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,820
school in Norway and she's one of our

383
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,459
teen ambassadors that is people that

384
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,930
sort of talk about a product and then we

385
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,730
include them in in the product

386
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,170
development and teach them how to sort

387
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,230
of do that kind of stuff she mostly

388
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,790
talks to her friends during class and

389
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,860
after school about various things and

390
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,750
they have a different usage pattern that

391
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,519
what you might expect they mute their

392
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,660
audio because they're in a privacy

393
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,769
sensitive setting so they won't don't

394
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:30,269
want a teacher or their parents to hear

395
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,230
about what they talk with their friends

396
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,959
they use chat a lot more and then on the

397
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,569
right you have slang he's my boss use

398
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:39,360
the sperian a lot naturally but he has

399
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,880
meetings so audio is very important to

400
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,740
him and useless meetings 121 while the

401
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,779
teen years or SAS group of friends

402
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,899
talking together so they don't expect

403
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,510
the same thing from the service but who

404
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,430
do you prioritize who do you get the

405
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,990
most growth from who do you want to

406
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,949
create the product for as our next

407
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:00,269
lesson that we had we have to get a

408
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,529
target market because in the beginning

409
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,779
we didn't and then we ended up doing all

410
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,360
these different things when we try to

411
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,579
solve problems that have different

412
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,799
solutions for different people so we

413
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,990
ended up choosing teens they have the

414
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,280
new interaction we haven't seen before

415
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,540
so we were confident that we could

416
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,339
create something that they wanted to use

417
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,770
that's none no other services we're

418
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,079
doing at the time and they have viral

419
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,760
growth because they share them with the

420
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,319
friends who shared with the larger group

421
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,630
rafael

422
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,660
you share with a larger group of friends

423
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,860
so we chose to implement stuff like

424
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,010
stickers bolder colors a better chat

425
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,480
instead of meeting invites booking

426
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,220
meetings email invites or calendar

427
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,970
updates or stuff like call in cell phone

428
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,030
numbers or that kinda stuff but it's

429
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,410
important to remember that even though

430
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,750
you choose a target that does not mean

431
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,730
that your product will only fit those

432
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,600
people for example our business users

433
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,790
loved our new stickers because when we

434
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,180
design this we solve problems for teens

435
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,250
but we made sure that we don't alienate

436
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,010
other people as well because the

437
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,630
problems that resolving are often

438
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,150
fundamentally the same thing but a

439
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,370
target lets us easily prioritize we can

440
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,900
easily say that no we're building this

441
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,760
feature for teens and we're not building

442
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,350
this because that was not priority right

443
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:32,860
now right then comes another problem

444
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,080
because once we started doing all of

445
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,910
this and we started getting it right

446
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,370
most of the time we started innovating

447
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,700
way too much what honestly because we

448
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,980
were overconfident because we had so

449
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,680
much success we thought that we could

450
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,970
change everything at once there were a

451
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,500
lot of things that we hated with current

452
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,620
apps or things that we thought we

453
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,700
couldn't do or things we want to change

454
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,470
so for example we knew that we need some

455
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,890
kind of user model but our entire

456
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,320
tagline for the server is no login so

457
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,970
naturally we couldn't have anything with

458
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,430
login or how do you create a user model

459
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,600
without logins we figure out I thought a

460
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,580
lot about it and figured out that yes

461
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,600
access profile that's lot better login

462
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,270
than anything else we made sure that the

463
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,190
forum was nowhere near recognizable as a

464
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,970
login form either and through user

465
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,260
testing this tested fine I mean we were

466
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,060
just not asking the right questions

467
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,140
because we were showing this in

468
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,560
isolation and most users are inclined to

469
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,680
say yes when asked you get this of

470
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,790
course they want to say yes if

471
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,560
do you get this or can you make this

472
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,730
work we're gonna click to do you

473
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,740
understand what send code means they do

474
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,500
but the expectation that I have what I

475
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,120
want to create the user is not access

476
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,900
profile or claim room so quick question

477
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,240
here where do you sign up I'm looking

478
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,820
against you answer but the up in the top

479
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,740
right corner the claim room button

480
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,030
that's basically where we wanted to

481
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,950
click because all the other cool

482
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,570
features that we built we're hidden

483
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,100
behind that little claim room button

484
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,080
there's got no way of telling you that

485
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,940
was sort of the main action that we

486
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,330
wanted you to do and you sure didn't

487
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,430
even see the like there was no sign up

488
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,070
button the sort of gets people going

489
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,240
usually so a lot of people did not end

490
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,770
up seeing the new stiff stuff that we

491
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,020
built which means that all the retention

492
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,670
mechanisms that we put in place where

493
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,200
for ninety percent of users that were

494
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,210
seen so I brings us to our next lesson

495
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,220
keep innovations to a minimum I firmly

496
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,320
believe that you have innovation points

497
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,910
that you get to spend for each product

498
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,410
that you have and once you've done

499
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,630
spending them then you have to do stuff

500
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,260
by the book like because users need to

501
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,980
feel familiar they need something to

502
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,690
compare this new experience that you're

503
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,990
giving them this new either way of doing

504
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,150
things to like and stuff it's something

505
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,240
that they have experienced before

506
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,460
otherwise they're going to feel confused

507
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,960
or you're going to make them feel stupid

508
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,360
because nobody wants to not get it

509
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,040
especially if your friends are saying oh

510
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,110
man this new service is so cool and then

511
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,760
they start using it and they don't get

512
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,400
anything and leaving your users feeling

513
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,230
stupid will ultimately make them leave

514
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,640
which is not what you want so eventually

515
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,980
we listened and we made logging and sign

516
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,440
up the way it was supposed to be and we

517
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,930
made it a better call to action and we

518
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,490
went from having two to three support

519
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,380
cases every day of people asking us

520
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,510
where do you log in like they've managed

521
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,100
to claim room but then they've sort of

522
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,840
switch computers or come to a new device

523
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,850
and I didn't figure out how to login

524
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,950
actually because it never said login

525
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,570
anywhere in our system we made sure of

526
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,320
that yeah here's someone laughing

527
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,049
this is a serious thing with it and

528
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,669
after we changed it we had we haven't

529
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,799
had a single support case about it in

530
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:08,539
eight months and perhaps longer now even

531
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:14,220
right it brings us to another lesson

532
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,080
that is listen for feedback because on a

533
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,809
real glad sort of the mild side the

534
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,250
empathy talk because a lot of the

535
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,929
feedback stuff is about having empathy

536
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,700
for users understanding and setting

537
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,820
yourself in their place and understand

538
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,080
the problems that they have with what

539
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,190
you're trying to create so you did a lot

540
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,600
of different things to listen feedback

541
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,700
the obvious choices are of course having

542
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,740
a support email or anything like that

543
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,419
but we also had set up something we call

544
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:49,809
the ambassador program which were teens

545
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,700
that liked our product we used to go out

546
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,700
and have lectures in schools about

547
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,100
coding or whatever and then teens that

548
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,419
were interested in sort of learning more

549
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,549
or talking to us we made them or abasa

550
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,080
ders so then we could use them to sort

551
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,720
of ask hey this new thing that we're

552
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,129
making does this make sense to you at

553
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:08,049
all or for the stickers like what

554
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:09,370
sticker should be great to that kind of

555
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,070
stuff that's also a good way to get and

556
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,110
listen for feedback is actually finding

557
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,299
our to users are and then reaching out

558
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,070
to them and asking hey do you actually

559
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,779
like our product or how can we make

560
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:25,179
stuff better for you but even if you do

561
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:26,799
everything right we think you do

562
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,220
everything right the coded right may

563
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,799
still break it all and this is a horror

564
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,559
story from from a time that we we had a

565
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,389
successful feature it did what if all

566
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:39,340
was supposed to do but something went

567
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:45,159
horribly horribly wrong so we introduced

568
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,879
a concept we called following which is

569
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:50,470
basically if you get notified when

570
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,710
someone sends a chat message or joins

571
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,899
the room or something that the intention

572
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:57,970
here was that the user wanted to figure

573
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,919
out or actually teens wanted to talk to

574
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,240
her friends and I wanted to know when

575
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,460
their friends were on the service and

576
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,570
what they were talking about they had a

577
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,929
fear of missing out the same was true

578
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,580
for teams they want to see if their team

579
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,150
was

580
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,710
in a stand-up or at a view and we tested

581
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,500
this well in beforehand we felt that we

582
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,370
really understood the problem I me of

583
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,540
course wanted people come back some

584
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,100
notifications a sort of a very obvious

585
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,560
way of doing that in a future itself

586
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,970
that was a success a lot of people

587
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,500
actually started coming back and they

588
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,450
used to future do IV we envisioned it

589
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,860
and the metrics looked good but then we

590
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,750
started seeing something weird the

591
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,400
performance of my server was was

592
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,110
horrible requests were taking more than

593
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,590
five seconds and this at first wasn't

594
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,630
very surprising to us because first we

595
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,850
had a sudden influx of many users the

596
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,560
teens that starting sparing it to their

597
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,630
friends and we saw a doubling of user

598
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,990
numbers and at the time we were running

599
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,480
a single server in Ireland with one no

600
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,430
J's process we did that for two years

601
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,700
and it worked fine but we figured like

602
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,400
some put scaling is going to be an issue

603
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,550
so we started working on improving that

604
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,260
of course but at the same time we saw

605
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,270
that there were two rooms with very

606
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,880
easily guessable room names that were

607
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,220
extremely active that every day of the

608
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,230
eye of the hour every hour of the day

609
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,810
and people were in there filling up the

610
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,850
with eight people I didn't think much

611
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,560
about it but one of the rooms were

612
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,000
actually owned by one of the team so we

613
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,500
went in there to check out what was

614
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,200
going on what we found was people just

615
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,550
chatting together getting to know each

616
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,150
other nothing serious but one one person

617
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,680
left another person joined this was sort

618
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,900
of sort of fine we thought we didn't

619
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,700
think much more of it but the

620
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,170
performance of the server got worse and

621
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,850
worse when we started shutting off more

622
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,590
and more features to try and actually

623
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,940
get it up and running how the core

624
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,150
service at least work and once we killed

625
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,950
notifications everything suddenly

626
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,720
improved so we sort of had like a hint

627
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,250
that where the problem was we started

628
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:08,050
investigating so it turns out that the

629
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,540
feature that we built had some duty

630
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,750
mostly technical debt and other yeah

631
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,610
reasons that come from having a product

632
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,220
running for two years some weird code

633
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,090
bats

634
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,370
and we had to sign this feature to be

635
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,340
mostly for six to seven people and we

636
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,830
haven't given much thought to

637
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,559
performance like at all it didn't really

638
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,690
matter if we did one or two extra

639
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,220
database queries we didn't look into

640
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,500
that but it turns out that for every

641
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,890
follower we were fetching the user data

642
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,710
from the database using this is actually

643
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,190
almost correctly copied from our from a

644
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,650
load base we're a map over each follower

645
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,210
and then we have something called the

646
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,340
user in richer which unless you were

647
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,690
familiar with the code and the pearson

648
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,610
implementing this worse not it actually

649
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,980
made a database query and this was fine

650
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,679
for ten maybe fifteen people but when we

651
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:03,770
had 500 plus people following a room for

652
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,049
every chat message you would do 500 and

653
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:08,120
then for some weird reason we were

654
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,919
throwing away the data which we got here

655
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,600
and then doing the same query three or

656
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,990
four more times which ended up resulting

657
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,510
we had two thousand database reads and a

658
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,640
thousand database rights / chat message

659
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,140
sent in those rooms directed all the

660
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,659
time which is crazy yeah so actually the

661
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:28,940
database was backed up that calls long

662
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,130
event cuse a node and triggered garbage

663
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,649
collection everything went to yeah

664
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:37,070
everything went amok really sonai should

665
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,539
be fixed it by having smarter queries

666
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:40,399
and we do both developers do we sort of

667
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,770
fix our problems but it's a nice example

668
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,799
of how the feature that you taught you

669
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,390
you knew exactly how it's going to be

670
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,860
used was used in a totally different way

671
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,630
than you expected with you and the code

672
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,429
that you write was actually negatively

673
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,320
impacting the performance of the servers

674
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,020
because of it and this happened because

675
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,100
when teens couldn't talk to their

676
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,690
friends when they weren't there they

677
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,130
were seeking other people to talk to you

678
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,600
and when they found these rooms with a

679
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,490
lot of users naturally they wanted to

680
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,169
follow those rooms that I could have

681
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:10,250
people to talk to you and it wasn't

682
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,260
generally like a good atmosphere in

683
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,580
these rooms as well there wasn't

684
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,110
anything like dangerous going on or

685
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,630
awkward going on really anyway I was a

686
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,779
bit of a regression but I hope to have

687
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:25,640
showed you that sort of to my own

688
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,100
experience that user experience is about

689
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,320
a lot more than just green and red

690
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,780
buttons it's about how you go about

691
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,830
understanding

692
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,080
how you talk to users how you find

693
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,480
minimal solutions to implement something

694
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,840
as fast as you can to test it out but

695
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,850
how you implement them it's about the

696
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,640
presentation and the messages you send

697
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,909
to users in the end and finally how you

698
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:51,679
refined that solution based on the

699
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,100
feedback and really it is about how you

700
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,110
write code how you approach problems and

701
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,610
how we communicate with your team and

702
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,309
your users so I really think that user

703
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:04,970
experience is everything allows it for
