1
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:27,770
I am going to talk about alternative iPhone
interactions.

2
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:38,890
Basically, it is about sensors in this guy.

3
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,180
When we move the smartphone about.

4
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,570
A lot of data.

5
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,559
And, instead of using touch and keyboard input.

6
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,999
A whole range of data we can utilize to augment.

7
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:56,340
How we work.

8
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,940
How we interact with smartphones today.

9
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,629
I'll get back to it in a little way.

10
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,629
This is me.

11
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,600
I'm a huge American football fan.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Bronco's fan.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,670
This picture was taken Superbowl night.

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,660
Just before disaster struck.

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,780
Some of you know what happened.

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,490
I work at Statsbiblioteket.

17
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,500
What did he say?!

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,530
It is a library.

19
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,180
This is the book tower.

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,119
16 stories of books.

21
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,259
I'm a frontend developer.

22
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,850
Working with search engines for the library
and mobile stuff.

23
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,079
A quick rundown.

24
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,440
This is university research and national library.

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
In Aarhus.

26
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,860
It keeps a lot of stuff.

27
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,859
Physical and digital.

28
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:06,140
My demo today is going to be performed in
the search index of 1 billion books and articles.

29
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,140
Hopefully that works.

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,140
As you can see.

31
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,660
We save a lot of stuff.

32
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,200
Mostly for preservational and cultural reasons.

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,900
All right...

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:28,550
So, just going to, my speech is 5 minutes
too long.

35
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,270
I have this Android watch with me.

36
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,480
I'll look at it.

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,940
Mobile javascript sensor Api's and events.

38
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,490
Just going to...

39
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,050
This is Can I use webpage.

40
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,750
Maybe you know it

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,990
Essential if you work across browser cutting
edge.

42
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:56,070
And you can see what browser is supported.

43
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,930
I'm not going into it.

44
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,170
It is a really good resource.

45
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:22,250
These are the sensor events and Api's I have
identified as relevant in modern mobile browsers.

46
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,950
Obviously the touch screen.

47
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,460
For touch events.

48
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,020
The geolocation.

49
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,020
Event.

50
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,860
Coming from the Gps.

51
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,040
Gives you location.

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,570
Motion.

53
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,450
From the device motion.

54
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,320
Api's.

55
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,680
They fire when you move the phone in space.

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,320
The device motion.

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,760
And the meter.

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,290
A subtle difference in the two.

59
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,510
The Getusermedia and streamapi.

60
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,510
It is for access to camera.

61
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,040
Communication.

62
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,630
And then there is the web speech Api.

63
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,780
For recognizing speech.

64
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,570
The rest are odd.

65
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,760
Proximity.

66
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,630
How close to the phone.

67
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,070
How much light is in the room.

68
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,730
I can get a reading on that.

69
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,730
Battery status.

70
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,140
I don't know how interesting that is.

71
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,750
But okay.

72
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:43,250
I'll just show you the demo search engine.

73
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,660
Hopefully this works.

74
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,750
As expected.

75
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:56,900
Need to do one more thing here.

76
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,290
This is a live demo.

77
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,720
Anything can go wrong.

78
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,630
Actually, now,...

79
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:09,820
I need a bit of tweak here.

80
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,780
This is Quicktime recording on the iPhone.

81
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,810
That is the best way I found to get a mobile
phone on the screen.

82
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,490
So, I'll perform a quick search.

83
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:34,440
And now I'm live searching on mothership index
of 1 billion records.

84
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,890
Hopefully with a result.

85
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,760
That's the search result for you.

86
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,110
A really basic search.

87
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,580
One that I built for this purpose.

88
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,490
I can switch the views.

89
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,780
To see a little more information.

90
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,780
Full view.

91
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,420
And go back.

92
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,940
Scroll up and down and favorite an item.

93
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,330
Fairly basic, but it works.

94
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:11,080
That was the demo search engine.

95
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:19,880
I'll be taking a closer look at the touch
event, device motion and web speech Api.

96
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,290
Touch event.

97
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,100
Touchstart, touchend and touchmove.

98
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,280
It is fairly basic.

99
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:42,540
I'll show you on the demo over here.

100
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,620
Switch to my touch part of the demo.

101
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,860
So now, we can see over here.

102
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,110
This is a bit small, isn't it?

103
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,200
Can you read the log?

104
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Okay.

105
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Great.

106
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I don't have to do anything.

107
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,810
So if you can see it says...

108
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:12,500
The finger I put on the screen, there is a
reading.

109
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,790
I can fit 5 fingers on my screen.

110
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,800
I don't know if it goes well.

111
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:33,130
Every time I press the screen a touch event
fires and you can see over here.

112
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,650
Containing information about the touch event.

113
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,380
A lot of stuff in there.

114
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,210
Basically, it is the position on screen.

115
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,230
And the target element.

116
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:54,870
Which Dom element I pressed with my finger.

117
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,980
There is a touch list.

118
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,510
Containing an array of touch events.

119
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,870
For each finger.

120
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:10,030
So, basically, you can access any data about
what happened on the screen.

121
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,389
And this is fairly basic stuff.

122
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:19,520
So, what can you do with it?

123
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,900
This is the Dollar 1 touch resture recognizer.

124
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,360
It is a little library.

125
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,180
That can be used to pick up gestures.

126
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,419
I'll show it here.

127
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,089
This is the live website.

128
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:44,389
You see, there is a canvas here.

129
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:49,370
If I draw a circle, the code picks it up as
a circle.

130
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:56,070
If I draw a rectangle, it gets picked up as
well.

131
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,379
I won't go into this.

132
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,230
This code up here.

133
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,720
It is in the library.

134
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,980
Being able to pick up gestures on screen.

135
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,339
I have put this into my demo.

136
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:17,709
So, hopefully, I can also pick up some more
advanced movements on the touchscreen.

137
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,699
Let's see.

138
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:22,689
Now, I just...

139
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:33,350
Now I 
draw a circle.

140
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,470
Hey!

141
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,149
It picked it up.

142
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,170
A circle up here.

143
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,990
I can do...

144
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,630
Triangle.

145
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,339
A line, and so on.

146
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,999
So, given an input, array of touch events.

147
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:56,999
This code recognizes basic shapes.

148
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,870
Which is a good thing.

149
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:06,199
So, how that can be used later.

150
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:13,559
So, now...

151
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,149
The device orientation event.

152
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,110
This is when you move the phone about.

153
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,110
A device orientation event is fired.

154
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,769
With 3 parameters.

155
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,220
The gamma.

156
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,509
Gamma is the measurement of the left to right
tilt of the phone.

157
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,649
Beta is front to back tilt.

158
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,670
And the alpha is compass direction of the
phone.

159
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,300
Turning this way.

160
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,570
Also show you that.

161
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:55,629
On the phone.

162
00:10:55,629 --> 00:11:00,829
This is a website that shows, tilts.

163
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:06,559
Tilt the phone to the left.

164
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,670
You have negative gamma readings.

165
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,959
Tilt it to the right.

166
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,040
Sorry about that.

167
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,720
Positive gamma readings.

168
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,970
And I tilt it forward.

169
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,860
Positive beta readings and backwards.

170
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,879
And of course if I can't see it on the screen
when I'm turning the phone.

171
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:35,889
So, have a alpha reading.

172
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:51,089
Yes, so, what I did was, try to use this data
coming from the device.

173
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:52,769
Orientation event.

174
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:57,940
To create a higher order gesture.

175
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:07,379
This reads the change in the gamma, positive
change yields tilt right.

176
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:12,189
And negative gamma change is tilt left.

177
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,749
I'll be using it in the search engine.

178
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:18,429
A demo in a little while

179
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:33,110
so, just show you how.

180
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,519
How things look.

181
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:45,860
So, I switch to...

182
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:53,449
I choose my motion.

183
00:12:53,449 --> 00:13:05,370
So, now you see data about the phone's position
in the room.

184
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,389
Move it about, you get readings.

185
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:11,110
As you can see.

186
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,649
Oops!

187
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:18,739
Upside down.

188
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:23,829
Tilt left.

189
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:26,369
No...

190
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:40,129
It is not supposed to happen.

191
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:51,800
I am just going to...

192
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,079
Sorry about that.

193
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,809
This is a live demo.

194
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:02,170
Things go wrong and they did.

195
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,480
Now, you see me.

196
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,589
Hello!

197
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:18,470
This is a new way to demo!

198
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:37,170
And we are back, I hope.

199
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,870
Yeah.

200
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,579
Okay.

201
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:51,220
Now, to speech.

202
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,319
The web speech.

203
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:55,290
Api picks up.

204
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,250
Speech.

205
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,999
And recognizes words, what I speak is actually,
webservice.

206
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:09,989
The backend of this feature is a backend.

207
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:12,649
Sorry, web service, provided by Google.

208
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:17,989
Which is also why it is only available in
Chrome, on Android at the moment.

209
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:22,540
It used to be on IOS.

210
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,860
But Apple pulled it for some reason.

211
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,290
I don't know.

212
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,600
I'll just demo it in the desktop Chrome version.

213
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,810
It works on Android phones.

214
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,149
It was too much to get it all setup.

215
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,699
I'll just switch to the speech part.

216
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:50,600
And speech recognition.

217
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,139
Hello computer?

218
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:02,049
Get a reading.

219
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:07,339
Well...

220
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,069
It is not perfect!

221
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:14,299
That's better.

222
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,420
So...

223
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,129
This is the fun part.

224
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:21,199
Always...

225
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,269
Yeah!

226
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:29,879
You have to speak in whole sentences.

227
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:38,439
Don't make breaks and don't, well, you know,
see what happens now.

228
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:41,619
That's fairly okay.

229
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:47,079
So, I'm...

230
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:49,819
(applause)

231
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:53,810
that's probably why Apple pulled it from Ios.

232
00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:01,689
I'm going to do one more thing I never thought
I would do in a presentation.

233
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:03,829
Fuck!

234
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:08,490
Yeah, well, okay...

235
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,579
(sigh)

236
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:21,299
So, let's put all this together in the search
engine and see how we can augment the way

237
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:31,309
we use it.

238
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:40,720
Okay.

239
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:50,130
So...

240
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,960
All together.

241
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:01,769
I do a search again.

242
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:06,190
So now, this is the same search result as
we saw before.

243
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:18,010
Augmented with the gestures and I'll just
show if I tilt the phone, to the right.

244
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,990
It switches view.

245
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,140
And I do it again.

246
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,490
Switches again.

247
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,860
The max view.

248
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,440
Tilt the view to the left.

249
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
Then it goes back.

250
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,860
And back.

251
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,279
Tilt to the phone...

252
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,029
Forward.

253
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:37,029
Scrolls down.

254
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:39,380
I don't know if you can see it.

255
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,450
It does.

256
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,450
And if I...

257
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,139
Tilt it back, it scrolls up.

258
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:54,880
Now, also, hopefully, I'm scrolling down to
the bottom.

259
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,960
If I make a circle, it has to go up.

260
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,170
It has a circle on screen.

261
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,170
Did you see it?

262
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,170
I'll do it again.

263
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,860
It is difficult.

264
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,179
The screen is scrolling.

265
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,960
But I'm drawing a circle.

266
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,899
It goes back to the top.

267
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:20,650
Also if I do a line right, hopefully it switches
view.

268
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,300
No, it doesn't.

269
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,950
Yes, it did.

270
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,549
This is picking up the two gestures that you
saw earlier on.

271
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:33,350
This is a combination of 2 and 3 gestures.

272
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:42,929
And it tends to get messy because things get
picked up mixed together.

273
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:48,450
If I scroll up, sometimes it also turns to
the medium view and so on.

274
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:54,730
I'll show how to control the search engine
using speech.

275
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:03,799
So, this is now the search enabled, speech
enabled speech engine.

276
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,460
I say: Search for computer.

277
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:15,039
It searches for computer.

278
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,929
Down!

279
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:18,820
Down.

280
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,720
Well...

281
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,610
Down!

282
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,510
Yeah!

283
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:30,620
It is scrolling down.

284
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,860
Down.

285
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,860
This is...

286
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,860
I never speak like this.

287
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
Down.

288
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,809
It is almost German accent.

289
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:44,330
Down!

290
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,840
Down...

291
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,360
Home!

292
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,850
It is going to the top.

293
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,700
Medium.

294
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,549


295
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,389
Extended.

296
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:01,240
Small.

297
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,090
Okay.

298
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,779
It works.

299
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:15,240
If you are very articulate.

300
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,450
(applause)

301
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:25,510
so, how much time do I have?

302
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:32,340
Clearly, we can augment the traditional paradigm
with these things.

303
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,509
The big question is of course, is it useful?

304
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:50,090
You look quite, sometimes, it is easy to speak
to the phone.

305
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,000
Something you do with the phone.

306
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,409
You look silly when you try to command your
phone.

307
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:00,899
Search.

308
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:02,399
People...

309
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:08,990
Also, you disturb other people if you are
talking to your phone all the time and doing

310
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,450
stuff.

311
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:18,720
And as we saw, it is very difficult to decode
the speech, there are bound to be mistakes.

312
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:26,620
Bound to be mistakes when you speak to the
phone.

313
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:32,010
Then, the gestures.

314
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,210
2D and 3D gestures.

315
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,269
They lack a common language.

316
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:45,600
We don't have a way of, common set of gestures
that mean something.

317
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,800
That's a challenge.

318
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:55,110
Also, they are quite hard to do on screen
as you saw.

319
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,750
If you have a scrolling search result and
you have to draw a circle.

320
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,710
Or triangle or something.

321
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,970
It is not very easy to interact.

322
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:14,350
Also, 3D gestures are quite hard to code.

323
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:20,230
And to separate noise and different interactions
from eachother.

324
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:35,919
So, there is a really a lot of challenges
involved.

325
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:44,559
But I guess, as always, it is very important
that you evaluate new features and test them

326
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,960
on users.

327
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:55,320
In this case, I really couldn't see any of
these ideas getting into the production search

328
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,200
engine.

329
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,720
Perhaps, perhaps this.

330
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,299
Except this.

331
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:10,330
Not scrolling down.

332
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:20,169
The subtle tilt, you can do it with the phone.

333
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,649
That's okay for me I think.

334
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:27,149
That could work.

335
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:28,659
But...

336
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:34,210
Drawing circles on the screen seems a bit
off.

337
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:40,679
So, as always, when you do such things.

338
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,820
Kill your darlings.

339
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:51,230
This is the best advice I probably can give
when dealing with these things.

340
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,269
Cutting edge speech and 3D gestures.

341
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:55,669
That was it.

342
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:56,669
Thank you.
