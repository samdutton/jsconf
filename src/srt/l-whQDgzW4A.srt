1
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,480

so before I I started just going to

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,390
thank Chris and Laura and Virginia and

3
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,420
the guides and the sponsors and everyone

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,640
that's making is possible a big round of

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,449
applause for jas cough is I'm I feel

6
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,190
really lucky because I've been to all

7
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,559
the jazz comp so far and my liver hates

8
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,620
me for it but yeah if this is this

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,769
events amazing all you people are red so

10
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:47,290
I'm a mobile software developer and I'm

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,530
also a Canadian and I'm a I'm a fan of

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,820
hockey and mobile dev is really tough

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,790
you got to deal with operating systems

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,780
you got to deal with all these different

15
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,979
SDKs and you got to deal with having a

16
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,500
million devices I think Reza gig yer

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,409
doubt that you need something like 4k in

18
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,990
phones in order to be able to test every

19
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,900
different device so it's really tough

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,250
like Tanner glass from the vancouver

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,350
canucks who is so tough that two bears

22
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,100
have to take him on not just one you'll

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,390
notice alright so I work on the phone

24
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,149
gap project which is a who's heard of

25
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:35,550
phonegap here all right I'm out

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,460
thank you it's not that easy so so

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,340
phonegap does make things really easy we

28
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,500
we abstract all the hardest parts of

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,990
getting started with mobile but one of

30
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,700
the problems that we can't abstract is

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,370
the actual automation of the SDKs and

32
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,630
the tooling that we're dealing with and

33
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,240
so who hears familiar with the UNIX

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,950
tools philosophy probably not that IE

35
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,030
guy but sure other people are so it's I

36
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,950
know it's too easy right it's like

37
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,210
beating up an old man it's no

38
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,720
satisfaction it so unit UNIX

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,960
philosophies well it's worth checking

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,730
out baseline of it is that we want to

41
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,650
have really simple small well-defined

42
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,800
tools we want to treat text as the way

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,410
in and out of our tools we want to be PI

44
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,490
pible so there's a whole lot of written

45
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,320
stuff on what UNIX tools philosophy is

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,730
all about I'm not just going to read my

47
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,380
slides I think it's important to a

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,180
software developers that we all look at

49
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,590
what tools are out there and what

50
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,840
philosophies are out there for doing

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,270
software development the best quotes I

52
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,530
heard about unix is that it's the

53
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,550
ultimate virus it's just never gone away

54
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,140
whether that's a compliment or an insult

55
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,739
I'll leave up to you and this has to be

56
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,250
contrasted to if you've if you get

57
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,480
bought into the whole UNIX tools

58
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,220
philosophy you'd be remiss not to read

59
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,500
the other side of it there's a book

60
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,510
called UNIX haters handbook and it is

61
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,290
hilarious I recommend reading it I won't

62
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,640
get into what they say but some of the

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,980
best trolling you've ever read in your

64
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,970
life so back into my problem space and

65
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,769
I'm dealing with mobile development

66
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,070
we've got this whole handful of SDK SDKs

67
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,650
IDEs all these different tools some are

68
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,519
good some are bad some are horrific so

69
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,800
and some are on windows

70
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,630
so I live on a street called cordova

71
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,080
street i also work on cordova street we

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,110
moved our office and I'm out of unique

73
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,140
names so I create a new project on

74
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,830
github called Cordova and it takes the

75
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,160
UNIX tools philosophy and brings it into

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,660
the mobile space right now it only

77
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,810
currently works on to us 10 it likely

78
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,780
works on linux machines at Dave Johnson

79
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,490
our CTO at night Toby apparently poured

80
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,980
it to python he's a masochist poured it

81
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,150
to windows so that's cool so what am I

82
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,260
talking about when I'm talking about

83
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,570
automation when you're building any

84
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,110
software at all you need to follow these

85
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,810
common steps and and this idea this

86
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,060
concept of writing software is platform

87
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,700
independent just how it gets done isn't

88
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,430
so when we're building things we want to

89
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,930
be able to automate the creation of it

90
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,400
when I was going through some of this

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,890
stuff Julio's worked with Xcode all

92
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,140
right so you might understand how I feel

93
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,550
about it so there's a there is a command

94
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,350
line tool for xcode it's called Xcode

95
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,750
build I was trying to get to automate

96
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,730
all build targets just so I didn't have

97
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,970
to actually open up Xcode and I was

98
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,650
having problems with a particular file

99
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,250
called a pbx project file and I was

100
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,850
bitching on Twitter and am active had

101
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,920
the audacity to send me a picture of

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,110
Xcode with a green arrow pointing to the

103
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,470
big green button so when I talk about

104
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,140
automation I'm talking about the ability

105
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,510
to repeat actions without human

106
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,970
intervention and so this whole computing

107
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,470
thing that we're involved in the reason

108
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,240
for computers we wanted them to do the

109
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,160
hard work for us we don't want to be

110
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,030
making simple repeated tasks something

111
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,920
that we do manually it's error-prone

112
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,130
it's likely to screw up and well that's

113
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,770
why we have computers in the first place

114
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,420
so creating projects building them

115
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,800
debugging them testing them releasing

116
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,510
them blogging and emulation these are

117
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,980
just some of the tacit that I'm

118
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,760
concerned about across platforms

119
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,580
I just thought this picture was funny so

120
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,030
I threw it in so why do we do this we

121
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,520
want to be iterating our code faster we

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,870
don't want to be walking between

123
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,150
different IDEs different build chains

124
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,370
have all this different ceremony it's

125
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,840
especially complex when you get into

126
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,460
multiple developer teams that don't have

127
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,860
a unified build chain if one guy sets up

128
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,120
his bill chain different than the other

129
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,700
guy shits going to go wrong that's just

130
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,950
how it works and you want to hide all

131
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,870
the proprietary build sludge your

132
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,940
product is not someone elses framework

133
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,430
your product is your product and so all

134
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,620
this other stuff that happens is not in

135
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,070
your problem domain some people like I

136
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,950
des and I think that's cool the Ides do

137
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,600
have advantages and people who like to

138
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,950
work in them it doesn't really matter

139
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,810
how you edit text but you should

140
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,290
automate all the things that you want a

141
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,910
lot of this stuff is just not quite

142
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,800
right to me either when we think about

143
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,130
it objectively an ID doesn't protect you

144
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,470
from bugs because if it has bugs then

145
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,640
you're going to run into problems and

146
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,290
we've seen this in almost every ID I

147
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,750
don't need to give you examples these

148
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,340
people say IDs get you close to the

149
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,720
platform they get you so close that you

150
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,840
can't use another platform Ides have

151
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,280
stepped debugging and I say you should

152
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,460
write unit tests some people say oh unit

153
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,110
tests you don't need them and those

154
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,740
people are right they don't need them so

155
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,450
I'm going to demo for you yeah is that

156
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,930
an awesome picture it's looking

157
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,980
no idea what the fuck's going on there

158
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,110
so this will be interesting where's my

159
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:27,100
shell okay probably can't read that

160
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,479
alright let's jump over to my desktop

161
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:34,100
cool don't be scared this is gonna hurt

162
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,210
so I've got a tool i called it phonegap

163
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,520
i don't know seemed obvious it's not

164
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,380
Ruby so what just happened there I just

165
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,360
generated a project and that project has

166
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,370
a make file that make file has a whole

167
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,530
bunch of stuff built in for you right

168
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,900
away so let's take a look at this this

169
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,150
project structure this is a point of

170
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,009
debate at night Toby the only thing we

171
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:03,449
all have in common is that everybody's

172
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,539
wrong nobody really knows what a

173
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,580
phonegap project structure looks like we

174
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,750
just know that everyone is doing it a

175
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,030
little bit different right now so I'm

176
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,590
not saying this is right or wrong this

177
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,330
is just one way to look at it I know

178
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,949
that every project probably has some

179
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:18,900
form of tooling and automation I put

180
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,789
those inside a bin directory you could

181
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:22,169
call it scripts you could call it

182
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,110
whatever you want there's a doc folder

183
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,270
it's got some documentation in it

184
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,729
surprisingly the lib folder that's where

185
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,289
I'm suggesting you put your scripts and

186
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:33,839
automation is a test folder that comes

187
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,570
pre built with qunit all set up there is

188
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,890
a temp folder which we're going to

189
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,589
pretend doesn't exist and there's a WWF

190
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:41,520
older and this is something that's

191
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,660
common in every phonegap project phone

192
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,570
gaps web code sowww makes sense to us so

193
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,850
that's cool

194
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,959
interim make create and so this

195
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,050
generates native projects into my temp

196
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,660
directory that actually may have

197
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,540
completed yeah so if i look at my temp

198
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,410
directory now I've got projects

199
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,839
pre-built for Android iOS and web less I

200
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,459
could tell you right now that the webos

201
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,190
stuff is broken and that the this is

202
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,810
really beta this is like stuff I've been

203
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,350
working on very recently so you know

204
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,510
watch out you might get cut bleeding

205
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,170
edge whatever we'll be adding more to

206
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,029
each of these with time so that's cool i

207
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:39,560
just made a bunch of projects I probably

208
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,940
want to kick up some emulators so let's

209
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:50,709
do that there's one it was my iOS sim

210
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,709
that's really regrettable I can't see it

211
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:58,040
what fucking bears and shit all right

212
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,540
well hmm

213
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,550
so this command is going to go off and

214
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,010
compile everything that's in my ww

215
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,540
folder against everything that's in the

216
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,390
temp folder launch it inside of the

217
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,269
emulators given my resolution we might

218
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:23,009
not be able to see this awesome demo

219
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:28,759
which is kind of shitty

220
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:36,819
Oh

221
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:45,660
so I successfully built for android I'm

222
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,249
going to have to search for it to find

223
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:51,869
it because I can't see the other half of

224
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:58,529
this emulator but there it is and so

225
00:10:58,529 --> 00:10:59,759
this just comes with like a vanilla

226
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,169
phonegap application that's actually

227
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:08,240
accurate android does work like this

228
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:19,890
I wish I was joking sweet a vanilla

229
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,970
phonegap application were my iOS

230
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,490
simulator somewhere in the realm of my

231
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,470
ability to see it we would see the exact

232
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,900
same app and so that's pretty sweet we

233
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,580
just went from doing absolutely nothing

234
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,230
to building two platforms in like five

235
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,600
minutes so that's that's super useful

236
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,620
but there's a whole bunch of other stuff

237
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,120
in here that's worth checking out and

238
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,470
this is all in your build shame but if

239
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,590
we look inside the bin directory I've

240
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,330
created a whole bunch of shell scripts

241
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,970
and yet their shell scripts for doing

242
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,800
all the things that you have to do while

243
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,620
you're building these things they're

244
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,940
there they're individually we're

245
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,830
checking out so like building creating a

246
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,130
new project debug is actually just doing

247
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,240
a build that interpolates some useful

248
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,970
stuff while you're running emulate just

249
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,550
kicks up emulators logging kicks up

250
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,150
loggers that log the standard output

251
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,190
there is prototype work going on for a

252
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,640
plug-in and there's test which will copy

253
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,560
stuff out of your test folder and into

254
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,720
your app so everything that you need to

255
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,400
do or maybe you don't need to do all in

256
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,030
one place all of the same nomenclature

257
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,360
all consistent which is kind of nice so

258
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,730
that's a brand new project and it's

259
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,530
super Beta but I do recommend check it

260
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,200
out we have another project that takes

261
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,970
these concepts and brings it to the web

262
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,300
it's called build phonegap com so if you

263
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,370
don't want to put up with installing all

264
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,560
this bullshit yourself will do it for

265
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,430
you you push up your index.html will

266
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,700
send back by Nuri's for every platform

267
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,820
and so that's what I got for you guys

268
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,279
let's drink some beer
