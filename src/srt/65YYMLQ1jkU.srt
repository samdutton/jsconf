00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,730
Hello!

2
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,840
Js Conf has been an amazing experience for
me.

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,490
I have been to a lot of tech conferences.

4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,810
I want to thank the organisers and Jan.

5
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,140
I have given this talk once.

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,110
At Berlin Js to 15 people.

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,170
I am no stranger to the internet.

8
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,180
Javascript community.

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,900
I have a lot of background in the internet.

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,790
This talk is about your roots.

11
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,210
In order to know what you are doing and where
you come from.

12
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,330
You need to know a little bit about the industry
you are working in, the history.

13
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:17,020
I think, technology and, it is about history
and culture.

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,229
History and culture is something that drives
everything we do on daily basis.

15
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,110
How you eat, look at the world.

16
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,950
How you create music.

17
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,010
And I think sometimes people forget that your
industry has a history.

18
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,090
You don't think about where it came from.

19
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,950
So this talk is about the roots of our industry
and how we ended up becoming technologists.

20
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,040
And able to empower people.

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,590
I want to guide you through some of the history
of Silicon Valley.

22
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,130
It is near and dear to me.

23
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,840
I have lived there for 11 years.

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,810
So, Hi, I'm Lindsay.

25
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:18,150
I'm an independent product manager for Amateur
Historian.

26
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,959
I have a background in interaction design,
visual communication.

27
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,430
I also studied history.

28
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,340
And I'm pretty avidly into politics and culture.

29
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,629
Less than 2 weeks ago I moved to Berlin.

30
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,049
I used JS conf as excuse to move.

31
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:38,950
That is not a joke.

32
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:47,990
I have been coming between Berlin and San
Francisco yearly since 1999.

33
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:53,020
The history is important to me.

34
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,920
When I studied.

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,200
This photo is from Teufelsberg.

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,489
A station in the West.

37
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:04,650
You should definitely go.

38
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,060
I thought it was ironic.

39
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,579
Someone had grafiti's that Sf to Berlin.

40
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:15,879
They have a lot in common.

41
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,439
I'll get to that at some point.

42
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,720
I'm not going to talk about myself for long.

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,409
I spent most of my professional history at
Apple.

44
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:28,019
2005 to 2011.

45
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,040
I started as an individual UI engineer.

46
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,000
It was not before internet.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,220
I went to Webkit.

48
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,760
In november 2009, we were getting upto speed.

49
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,370
I'm not a stranger to internet technology.

50
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,150
What it can do and how it affects people.

51
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,930
My team created interactive web prototypes,
promotions.

52
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,409
If you see anything for iTunes London.

53
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,780
We worked on the backend and frontend systems.

54
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,939
To make that technology work.

55
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:12,390
I quit 3 years ago.

56
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,400
I needed a break and do something different.

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,360
I spent 3 months in Berlin when I left.

58
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:29,810
I think this leads nicely to a quote that
I think we are possibly familiar with zozer

59
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,240
Stay hungry, stay foolish.

60
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,070
Has been misappropriated to Steve Jobs a lot.

61
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,530
He mentioned in a 2005 Stanford speech.

62
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,730
After he died, people started making the Steves
quote.

63
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:53,070
It actually came from the back of something
of a catalogue.

64
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,070
I'm going through history.

65
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:01,820
It influenced how we got to personal computingt.

66
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:09,730
I'm going to introduce Stewart Brant.

67
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,100
He is a biologist.

68
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:19,370
In interest in politics as well zozer He worked
on the mother of all demo's.

69
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,180
You know with Doug Inglebart.

70
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,600
A famous presentation of lot of computer technologies.

71
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,950
Hypertext, email and the mouse.

72
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,320
When he was a kid, he was running around on
this hippy bus.

73
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,570
With the Merry Pranksters.

74
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,170
This is in 1964.

75
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:55,780
They were really trying to dropping Lsd in
Middle America.

76
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,780
Doing drugs.

77
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,240
And getting cold war america to see an alternative.

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,080
To a more adventurous way to live.

79
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,430
They were not afraid of technology.

80
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,390
It was mostly being used for war.

81
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:21,660
So the Merry Pranksters really deployed technology
to create new consciousness and a new form

82
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,650
of social organization.

83
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,870
I could talk for days about Counterculture.

84
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,930
If you would like to read more about that
bit of the counterculture.

85
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,190
There is a book.

86
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,390
The electric Kool-Aid acid test.

87
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:41,840
It is a good reference where it was coming
from.

88
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,500
I also want to talk about what was going on
in Silicon Valley.

89
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,050
It has a large root in military technology.

90
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,870
And military investment.

91
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:02,970
Stanford created a link between the department
of defense and technology.

92
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:10,300
Satellites were being developed back to the
1920s, through the 40s and 50s.

93
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,780
They were making microwaves, missiles.

94
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:20,750
It became known for what it is, the microprocessor.

95
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,620
So there was this anti technology sentiment
going on.

96
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,530
This is a student protesting at Stanford.

97
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,340
He has a punchcard that says Strike.

98
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,990
There was a large part of people who were
not into technology.

99
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:46,040
The counterculture you used to seeing is more
of these protesters out with signs.

100
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,520
Trying to change things based on standing
around with signs.

101
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,920
There was a division between the countercultures
zozer there was this new left idea.

102
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:02,930
Before I go through the slide, I want credit
Fred Turner who wrote the book.

103
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,890
He divided these countercultures.

104
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:13,880
The new left was working through bureaucracy,
hierarchy, organization and established structures.

105
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,780
The new communinalists.

106
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,560
They were smart.

107
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,780
Using small scaled technologies, Lsd.

108
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,890
Bucky domes.

109
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,320
And community building.

110
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,050
The difference is, the new left was trying
to work with the established systems.

111
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,950
And these new communalists said, this is fucked
up.

112
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,690
We are going to do something different.

113
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,900
There is a story of a protest at Berkley.

114
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:57,550
Where looking at these kids saying, what are
you going to do?

115
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,610
Change something?

116
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,769
He starts to play his harmonica.

117
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:07,430
That was the mindset of the people there.

118
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:17,730
So,t if the American state deployed massive
weapons to destroy far away people, would

119
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,269
deploy small scale technologies to bring people
together.

120
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,519
It looked like this.

121
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,389
This is one of the first communes.

122
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:31,970
It was in Colorado, Drop City.

123
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:38,819
People started moving away from their homes
to create this new city, new idea.

124
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,029
This new way of living.

125
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:45,300
That was around a common humanity.

126
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,070
Dome was the new home.

127
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,589
This is, it was literally like, your suburban
houses are square.

128
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:55,970
We live in domes.

129
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,160
This system is fucked up.

130
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:04,620
We are ready to get bombed by someone.

131
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,699
There was the notion of distributed working.

132
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:12,810
This slide says, if you can read it.

133
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,250
Workers of the world, disperse.

134
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,740
It is not uncommon how we can work today.

135
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,509
We can do our craft.

136
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,620
There is a link between this and how we can
work today.

137
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:37,059
San Francisco basically became the heart of
a new world for the United States.

138
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:42,170
People were coming from all over the country
to experience what it was like.

139
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:49,629
This is not so different to how I see people
trying to flock to San Francisco today.

140
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,791
It really was the heart of it.

141
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,960
It was very much centered in the West Coast.

142
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,399
To introduce the catalogues.

143
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,920
Sitting on a hill.

144
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,990
Looking at the earth.

145
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:10,309
He wondered, why haven't we seen a photo of
the whole earth yet?

146
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,329
This was in 1966.

147
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:15,440
He started a public campaign for Nasa.

148
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,860
To publish a photo of the whole earth.

149
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,130
It was a powerful symbol of humanity.

150
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:28,980
When you face a nuclear war.

151
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,120
Adapt the strategies.

152
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,820
The whole earth catalog was born.

153
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,470
This is the front of the catalogue.

154
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:42,129
It became a manual for people on the land.

155
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:49,149
The difference was, the catalog didn't sell
anything.

156
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:58,639
When Steve mentioned this, he was talking
about how this was Google before Google existed.

157
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,990
It didn't sell anything.

158
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:08,230
The purpose of the catalog was basically to
empower people.

159
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,410
To do their ov thing.

160
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:15,000
This says, we are as gods, we might as well
get used to it.

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,059
In response to...

162
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,329
This was in the catalog.

163
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:23,119
User contributed content.

164
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:28,269
People would write in things they thought
were useful.

165
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,660
I think you should publish this.

166
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,870
They would go ahead and publish it.

167
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,959
I am going to keep this.

168
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,309
You can read it.

169
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:46,089
I think this is the core of the thinking at
the time and the thinking around this catalog

170
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:58,269
and movement highly influenced everyone that
created technology today.

171
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:01,110
This is the inside of the catalog.

172
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,850
Like I said, readers could submit information.

173
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,589
And it also included a lot of books.

174
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:11,950
A lot of books around mindset and thinking.

175
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,369
Not around how to make gardens.

176
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:21,639
So, it was not only a functional tool for
how to build your dome.

177
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,990
But also a consciousness tool how to think
about the world.

178
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,990
Here is another one.

179
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,749
I brought my copy of the catalog to Berlin.

180
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:34,759
It is one of my most prized objects.

181
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,059
I have it if you want to see it.

182
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:43,550
I haven't taken it out of the wrappings.

183
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,300
This was printed on cheap newspaper paper.

184
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,589
And one of the things is interesting.

185
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,420
At some point this calculator showed up.

186
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:02,009
It was a 4900$ calculator.

187
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:07,709
It had to be good and uncommon knowledge to
be in the catalog.

188
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:14,819
So, the founding editor of Wired magazine
actually was an actually of the Whole Earth

189
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:17,959
Catalog.

190
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:23,920
Brand invented the blogosphere before there
was an internet.

191
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,769
The idea of the earth was, people could rally
around.

192
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,220
And get together around their common ideas.

193
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:40,019
Which is again not so different what we do
on the internet today.

194
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,139
On Twitter, wherever.

195
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:45,769
So, this is a photo of Alan Kaye.

196
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,790
The first Gui.

197
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,999
And Xerox library had a lot of the books from
the catalog.

198
00:14:51,999 --> 00:15:02,170
Alan Kaye talks about how he was influenced
by the thinking of that time.

199
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:14,269
This culture started to get into university
labs and the AI institute.

200
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:20,550
There was a story about how people would sit
around naked in a sauna smoking pot waiting

201
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,730
for the code to compile.

202
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,430
You compile your code at some point.

203
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,999
There is a lot of this history.

204
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,059
It goes on forever.

205
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:38,980
I'm fascinated by it.

206
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,579
The whole earth wasn't just a catalog.

207
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:45,910
There was a network of people and ideas that
started to come around.

208
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,170
There were publications after the Whole Earth.

209
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,889
It was from 68 to 74.

210
00:15:52,889 --> 00:16:00,339
Next slide is, there was the thing called
the Well.

211
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,509
Also the Global Business network Brand is
a part of.

212
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:11,459
It enables government agencies to think about
longterm thinking rather than shortterm thinking

213
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:15,540
zozer Wired Magazine you know.

214
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,319
And the Long Now Foundation.

215
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,739
What Stewart Brand is currently involved in.

216
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,329
This is a photo of the Well.

217
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,839
It is still active on the internet today.

218
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,000
It is the oldest community running on internet.

219
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,920
Since 1985.

220
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:37,209
It has been on the internet since 30 years.

221
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,790
30 years is a long time.

222
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,680
Especially in internet time.

223
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,249
It is mostly known for the internet forums.

224
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:48,690
Provided email.

225
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,970
Access to webpages.

226
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,089
It became one of the original Isp's.

227
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:59,489
When commercial access was allowed.

228
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:02,120
What else is interesting.

229
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,339
The founders met on the Well.

230
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:12,500
They start talking about this idea and it
was kind of this whole earth turns into the

231
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,350
internet.

232
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,770
So terms that came out of it things you know.

233
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,089
Personal computer, virtual community, electronic
frontier.

234
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:31,250
They are part of the history and why we can
sit in this room today.

235
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:37,679
We are from, I'm from the US.

236
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,460
There is a lot.

237
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,100
This is required reading if you work in technology.

238
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,120
From counterculture to cyberculture.

239
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:53,000
Fred Turner is a friend of mine.

240
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,010
How the councerculture influenced Silicon
Valley.

241
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,549
A nice story about Fred.

242
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:05,669
He lived in Kreuzburg in the 1980s.

243
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,929
And was part of the counterculture in Berlin.

244
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:11,890
He is a professor at Stanford.

245
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,440
It is a great book.

246
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,269
It is longer.

247
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:22,230
If you would like a more journalistic approach,
What the Dormouse said.

248
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,470
By Markoff.

249
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:33,559
Some of the anecdotes about how the East and
West coast ideology, were shaping.

250
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:39,429
How personal computing and thinking about
computing happened.

251
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:45,480
I don't know if you are really known about
San Francisco.

252
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,919
I don't know what the fuck happened.

253
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,039
I have lived there for 11 years.

254
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,179
And we have Obama's advisor.

255
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:12,970
We have becoming rejecting the man to becoming
the man.

256
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,110
And I have been in San Francisco, this has
been in the blogs forever.

257
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,750
It has been coming up for years.

258
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,950
Now it is in the international press.

259
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,520
It is all over the place.

260
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,539
Another one from the Economist.

261
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:40,870
This notion of I don't know this notion of
this ideolized society has gone to a capitalistic

262
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:49,090
view of how everything should work zozer here
is one from a German newspaper.

263
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,240
Not sure what happened.

264
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,730
Here are some ideas about what happened.

265
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,100
The counterculture was homogeneous.

266
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,320
Most were middle class, white.

267
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,330
Excluded outsiders.

268
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,799
It was cliquey.

269
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:10,160
There are photo's of women.

270
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,770
Carrying bread.

271
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,990
Charisma was a huge part.

272
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:21,400
How to become a leader in the commune zozer
It was cool.

273
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:28,820
You see it reflected in cultures like Google
or Apple.

274
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,980
It's a little bit disturbing.

275
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,270
Somebody mentioned.Z You work at Google, it
is great.

276
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:43,659
The guy behind the counter is making less
than minimum wage.

277
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:49,480
You really just kind of cause this disperity
to continue.

278
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,590
So, we need to reidentify.

279
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,740
I believe in this.

280
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,840
And what I see happening.

281
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,600
Especially, in the US and world.

282
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,830
People want to copy Silicon Valley.

283
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,080
I don't think you can do it.

284
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,490
It was centered in culture in a place in time.

285
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,110
Silicon Valley in California.

286
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,900
Great.

287
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,399
You have Silicon Allee in Berlin.

288
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:28,330
You have Silicon Roundabout, which is funny,
in London.

289
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,630
Silicon Forrest in Portland.

290
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:37,899
You have this rubber stamp of people copying
a culture that doesn't make sense.

291
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:41,679
So, first of all, can we stop calling things
silicon?

292
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:48,649
You know anybody knows making silicon?

293
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:56,120
Apps, Javascript, not silicon chips.

294
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,860
I think it is time that we reidentify.

295
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,640
This culture is really old.

296
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:08,370
It is like I feel we are at the same historical
moment with everything that is going on.

297
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,250
With Nsa.

298
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,250
Wars going on.

299
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:17,549
It is time that we relook and reidentify what
we are doing.

300
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:20,980
Is anyone from London in the room?

301
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,169
Silicon Roundabout?

302
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:25,950
It was a joke that came up in a pub.

303
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,230
By Matt Biddulph.

304
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,920
The government got involved.

305
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,169
Started funding the roundabout.

306
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:41,120
It was a joke!

307
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,620
It is crazy.

308
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:50,750
So, my point is, is that we all come from
totally different historical and cultural

309
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,750
backgrounds.

310
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,240
It is imporlant like Europe.

311
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,660
Berlin.

312
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,940
We come from different mindsets.

313
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:05,100
Trying to rubberstamp Silicon Valley doesn't
make sense.

314
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,179
You should be London, Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam.

315
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:14,049
Please, fucking stay Berlin.

316
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:16,390
I mean it.

317
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,070
I see the same kind of things going on in
the city.

318
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,450
I chose to move here.

319
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,370
It reminded me of San Francisco 11 years ago.

320
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:34,210
I think this room gives me a lot of optimism
zozer Everyone I met is super ankesome, interesting.

321
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:41,090
Really, about I don't know being creative
and using technology.

322
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,700
It is frustrating to watch it happen.

323
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:54,059
If I have a say while I'm here, Make sure
that Berlin stays Berlin.

324
00:23:54,059 --> 00:24:00,350
We started out about, we needed to lower tresholds
and empower individuals.

325
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,830
We need to get back to that.

326
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,690
As you move on, this was the back of the last
World Catalog.

327
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,651
Stay hungry and foolish.

328
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:11,651
Thank you for letting me talk.
