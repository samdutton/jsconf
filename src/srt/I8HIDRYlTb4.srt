1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879

so I'm if you've seen me last year I'm

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,589
the machine learning person and so like

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,510
I said in my introduction and this is

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,450
going to be about this is a use it a

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,640
case study about how I went about to

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,560
ride a system that will learn stuff

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,080
that's the short the the float

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,789
explanation I would like to walk around

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,380
more but apparently I have to stay close

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,779
to the microphone so this is me and this

11
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,969
was the good old days there was last

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,820
year at the json conf you can follow me

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,989
on twitter on github those other the

14
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,850
platforms that i actually look at if you

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,410
want to catch up so during my day time

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,960
basically I'm a software developer at

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
dot and squander and we're startup doing

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,510
a bit of travel screw a bit of Titan

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,850
machine learning and we have an app so

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,710
if that is that interesting for you you

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,620
can talk to me about that too and but by

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,899
night I'm a machine learning enthusiast

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,680
so this is my hobby basically all right

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,549
um let's talk about the game that we

25
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,950
haven't googled yet even though I asked

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,920
you to this is crease that's the

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,369
original game basically and as you can

28
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,610
see basically the idea is to merge one

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,299
and two or multiples of three and as

30
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,130
soon as you merge them you get a higher

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,630
value get the sum of those values that

32
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,119
you've merged and I don't know what the

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,009
goal is actually is I guess it's to play

34
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,979
as long as you can and basically you

35
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,100
have two inputs left right up down and

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,750
then every time you swipe left you will

37
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,430
swap the entire board to the left that's

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,890
the basic idea

39
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,500
so threes came out and then suddenly for

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,040
some reason I think someone implemented

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,680
the simpler version of it of open source

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,450
and then suddenly like all kinds of

43
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,780
clones came up the originals 2048 and

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,719
there are all kinds of 2048 likes games

45
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,259
I think the most popular was 1024 or

46
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,250
1024 but there are also like like this

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,349
one

48
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:16,040
which is pretty hard to know which one

49
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,810
you have to merge and what it's going to

50
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,620
be afterwards but I guess it works so

51
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,540
but I'm going to be talking about the

52
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,280
simplest implementation that's 2048

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
that's just the basic you can check it

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,389
out on github and it's free and runs in

55
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,750
the browser yeah the I think the most

56
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,879
the hardest thing actually

57
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,980
while working on it was not to get

58
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,540
distracted by the game also often

59
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,669
because you're gonna just like I'm going

60
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,499
to try this out and suddenly like 10

61
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:43,519
minutes later you realize I've been

62
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,079
playing this game for 10 minutes now I

63
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:48,139
should really get to work all right

64
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,959
um so let's look at the rules click

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,549
overview just so we are all on the same

66
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,239
page we have a four by four grid I've

67
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,629
all seen that and each term basically

68
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,849
you take an action which I call alpha

69
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,540
here and alpha is zero one two or three

70
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,329
so it's one of of this set of numbers

71
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:12,409
and so you take this action and after

72
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:15,290
you've moved the new tire a new toy will

73
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,930
edit to an empty space and there is a

74
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,669
probability distribution so there's a

75
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,979
90% chance that the new tile is going to

76
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:24,829
be 2 and there's a 10% probability that

77
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,599
the new tile is gonna before so every

78
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,979
time you move you get a new tile if you

79
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:34,459
merge two tiles with the same value then

80
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,639
you will get one new tile with the value

81
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,069
of the sum of those two tiles I think

82
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,019
you you've seen that I just written it

83
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,799
up once more so remembered all right and

84
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,079
then so basically there are three

85
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,209
measurements and how how well you're

86
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,150
doing you lose when there are no more

87
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,009
moves possible because they were borders

88
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,750
full and you can move anywhere to merge

89
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,739
anything and you win when you have one

90
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,780
tile with 2048 present or let 1024 in

91
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,790
the other game or like the rainbow dog

92
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,019
with the dog game and then there's

93
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,909
additional a thing that's called the

94
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,669
score and the score is basically every

95
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:20,510
time you merge two tiles then the sum of

96
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,969
those two tiles the added to the score

97
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,620
so basically every time you merge

98
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,310
something

99
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,220
score gets updated at gets higher so

100
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,250
these are the basic set of rules and so

101
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,260
I basically just started as thinking

102
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,150
okay first thing the most important

103
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,389
thing is the name after 2048 of course

104
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,550
it's the pun it's a reference to alphago

105
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,530
they would stick the most important

106
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,850
thing and once I got the name I was like

107
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,419
okay mo

108
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:48,560
I'm all set now the second thing was

109
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,990
that it has to be JavaScript because I

110
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,630
really like JavaScript it's easy to

111
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,580
setup it just runs you can run it in the

112
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,350
browser you can run with notes so it was

113
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,720
just just to simplify things basically

114
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,450
and then the other thing was that it

115
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,060
needs to be supervised and so basically

116
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,560
supervised learning means that I'm

117
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,500
teaching my machine something where I

118
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,570
already know the correct answer I

119
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,460
already know what I want my machine to

120
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,160
predict for me so I'm gonna I'm telling

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,570
my machine ok if you get this set of

122
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,330
inputs I'm expecting this output the

123
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,970
other thing I'm supervised learning you

124
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,770
just tell the machine do you see a

125
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,970
pattern here but I don't know the

126
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,280
pattern so supervised because we know

127
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,840
when we get to 2048 we be win all right

128
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,130
so I was I started with a library those

129
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,780
of you who see me give the talk last

130
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,220
year you already know it it's called

131
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,940
synaptic and blue because it's the link

132
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,950
and kinetic is a neuro Network library

133
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,620
for JavaScript oh yeah so I don't know

134
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,940
neuro networks I think you've heard of

135
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,680
it I'm not going to explain it it's just

136
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,720
it's doing machine learning magic that's

137
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,210
why I don't know

138
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,510
and so the what synaptic does is does

139
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,160
classification which means it classifies

140
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,979
words in the end you get either either 0

141
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,620
or 1 for whatever you want to predict so

142
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,860
you can't predict numbers per se that

143
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,900
would be called regression so you can't

144
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,910
predict like if I make this move what

145
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,770
will my score be so it has to be

146
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,510
something the thing you want to predict

147
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,680
has to be something between 0 or 1 or

148
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,470
true or false respectively so yeah and

149
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,409
then of course I have prior experience

150
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,050
with synaptic that's also linked to the

151
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,150
product I showed last year it was

152
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,800
a soccer result predictor thing so that

153
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,050
was basically the reasons why child with

154
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,150
synaptic I already knew everything and

155
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,920
then yeah I had a pretty good idea what

156
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,810
I wanted to so um yeah first iteration

157
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,780
so first I'm basically trying to sign

158
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,170
out what is it that I want to do

159
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,480
actually what is it that I want to teach

160
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,790
my machine or what what is the first

161
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,080
step I need to do right now

162
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,960
so the first step I thought for gather

163
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,320
data we I need some kind of data and the

164
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,950
idea was that basically you I try to

165
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,670
predict the next the best possible move

166
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,120
for every turn basically so the way I

167
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,410
went to do that was to simulate all

168
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,200
actions so if I have a board say let's

169
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,700
say that's the first day that I've and

170
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,470
starting to play the game then I'm going

171
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,500
to simulate all possible actions so four

172
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,350
of them and then afterwards I'm going to

173
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,720
check dipper score increase so basically

174
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,190
when I swipe left with the score

175
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,870
increase when I swipe up to the score

176
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,750
increase blah blah blah and then after I

177
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,960
did that I actually just made a random

178
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,210
move for the game so first I simulate

179
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,880
and then I just make a random move I

180
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,710
could have of course just checked where

181
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,240
does the score increase and make that

182
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,980
move but I wanted to start random

183
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,800
because I wanted to see how well my

184
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,700
algorithm basically performed against

185
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,040
this randomly moving and you would be

186
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,900
surprised if it will random move you

187
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,440
will get to like 256 every tenth time so

188
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,540
like you can just play it randomly don't

189
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,470
look at it it's pretty good so um yeah

190
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,240
this is basically what my data set

191
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,870
looked like board state was my input

192
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,780
that's a serialized state of the board

193
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,200
so I just have like I just I count from

194
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,350
left upper left to down right basically

195
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,120
and then it's zero to zero I don't know

196
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,760
one and then just goes on as this is a

197
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,240
16 different element of course and the

198
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,590
actions those are basically bulls that

199
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,170
say if the score has increased after

200
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,029
making this value so basically I'm

201
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:56,710
saying I have this board state right now

202
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,730
and for each action I took this is what

203
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,980
happened to the score zero is the score

204
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,870
didn't increase one means that a score

205
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,440
increased so I guess that's pretty clear

206
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,730
what I mean yes okay all right so I

207
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,860
played I like I know I similar they're

208
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,940
like 100 games or so and then I was like

209
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,130
okay I have I have data now I think

210
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,560
that's going to going to give me like a

211
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,339
good indicator whether my idea is

212
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:33,190
working on so second iteration this time

213
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,589
the goal was to compare the trend

214
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:38,320
network with the unfriend or with a

215
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,950
random decision maker and so of course

216
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,660
the first thing I need to do is train a

217
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,690
neural network and basically the way you

218
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,580
go about training a neural network is

219
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,200
just give it the input give it the

220
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,660
output and then let it run a lot of time

221
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,770
so it will slowly hopefully recognize

222
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,100
the pattern behind the stuff you want to

223
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,220
predict and then so after it

224
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,560
strengthened your network I will use

225
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,450
that network to predict whether the

226
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,520
score increases are not for each of the

227
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,580
possible actions and then in the game

228
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,710
itself I'm going to move make the move

229
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,660
where the probability that the score

230
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,300
will actually increase is the highest

231
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,330
that's pretty straight forward so I'm

232
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,620
not gonna I'm not going to show you any

233
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,910
data on this because it was pretty

234
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,520
boring and wasn't like there's nothing

235
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,070
to see I just save them into couch and I

236
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,550
came up with some several metrics but

237
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,040
the conclusion basically to make it

238
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,410
short was that it didn't work all too

239
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,390
great I think it was a little bit better

240
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,360
than doing it randomly but there was no

241
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,850
I see that the game is actually being

242
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,459
played in a in a meaningful well I guys

243
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,680
liked my I don't think the algorithm

244
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,209
actually understood what this game was

245
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:55,360
about and I think the reason why I was

246
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,970
like that is that it it focused only on

247
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,220
the next state so it was basically only

248
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,740
predicting whether

249
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,290
we'll increase the score for the next

250
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,300
state but it didn't have like the

251
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,399
foresight to check whether this will be

252
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,970
good for the for the whole game so what

253
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,560
I needed was some kind of machine

254
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,450
learning method that had had more

255
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,610
foresight that would be able to see that

256
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,649
it's not only one move but it's like a

257
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,180
series of moves and then at the end

258
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,250
that's the most important state

259
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,779
basically did you win or did you lose

260
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:31,149
all right so I looked around a bit

261
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,820
really I just had to ask myself do I

262
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,490
want to keep using synaptic and the

263
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,010
specification network and try to come up

264
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,640
with better better inputs and stuff like

265
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,290
that or do I want to scrap it and do

266
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,440
something completely different and

267
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,320
thankfully my husband who wanted to do

268
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,940
the ghost day I think button he didn't

269
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,910
and he helped me a little bit with it

270
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,300
and then he introduced me basically to

271
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,370
nice methods that were perfect for my

272
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,270
use case and basically it's about

273
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,610
reinforcement learning reinforcement

274
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,160
learning as the name already says is

275
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,930
basically that you instead of giving

276
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,990
your system a value at the end you will

277
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,209
just tell it this is slightly better or

278
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:18,010
this is slightly worse so it's not like

279
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,250
like a full like a 1 or a 0 it's just

280
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,839
like oh this is pretty good or this is

281
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,750
not as good the reinforcement learning

282
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,870
makes use of like two or three different

283
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,670
strategies basically and the first one

284
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,339
is called Markov decision process and I

285
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,779
don't know maybe you've heard of the

286
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,270
Markov chain the Markov chain is

287
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,910
basically it is a defined chain of

288
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,589
states and actions so you have a state

289
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,870
and that state has one possible action

290
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,790
then it will lead you to another state

291
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,890
and that's it will have another possible

292
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,140
action it's a stochastic model so

293
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,680
there's like the one action that it's

294
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,480
going to take is like the one that is

295
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,440
probably probable if the higher has the

296
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,570
highest probability of being taken but

297
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,899
this is one defined chain and there's no

298
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:09,490
decision-making in it because the chain

299
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,850
has already existed from

300
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,679
from the beginning and the Markov

301
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,089
decision process is basically an

302
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,239
enhancement of that chain so it if you

303
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:19,939
take if we take a decision process you

304
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:22,759
have the rewards and the end and you

305
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,629
have possible directions and the

306
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:28,759
decision process basically decides which

307
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,689
action is going to take or if you say

308
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:34,429
the other way around if you take a mark

309
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:37,279
of the certain process and only give the

310
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,819
reward 0 and if you only have one action

311
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,319
then it's the same as a Markov chain

312
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:47,299
that's basically the the thing then the

313
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:49,459
other nice thing for reinforcement

314
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:50,839
learning is that it can deal with the

315
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,579
delayed reward so you can have a lot of

316
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,009
states and actions and then give a

317
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,199
reward at the end of the of the chain

318
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,749
basically that's nice because then you

319
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:01,429
can tell your system that this is like a

320
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,829
chain and then in the end the end of

321
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:07,249
that thing that actually matters so this

322
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:09,589
is actually perfect for games or for my

323
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:14,839
case and so the one thing that is

324
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,549
basically the the challenge of

325
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:19,789
reinforcement learning is exploration

326
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,729
versus exploitation and what that means

327
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:26,769
is that so on the one hand all the

328
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,850
experience that your machine gets

329
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,489
especially from the machine playing so

330
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:34,879
it plays and while it plays it learns so

331
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,319
you want to have a lot of different

332
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:38,509
kinds of datasets so it will learn new

333
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,220
stuff we learn different stuff learn

334
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,559
different ways to go but on the other

335
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,689
hand you also want your machine to do

336
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:46,279
the best possible moves that are knows

337
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,809
of so you got to balance those things

338
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:50,779
like just don't be too random but also

339
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:53,029
don't only stick to the stuff you

340
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:58,489
already know all right and then there's

341
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:00,829
some another machine learning method

342
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,379
that's more it's like more concrete and

343
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:05,600
also something that is basically perfect

344
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,179
for my use case it's called temporal

345
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:12,199
difference learning and the thing about

346
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,579
temporal distance learning is basically

347
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,949
that is it knows that there is a state

348
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,569
in the end and there are states and

349
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:19,430
actions that precede this end

350
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,040
and it will slowly learn how those

351
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,220
states before can influence the state in

352
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,830
the end and also get that maybe he liked

353
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,660
the the begins there's a pretty

354
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,910
important which moves you make but the

355
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,220
the the ones to what the end are not as

356
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,740
important anymore so those are things

357
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,420
that the temporal difference learning

358
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,260
deals with and there's also two

359
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,550
basically two strategies you need to

360
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,620
understand the first one is dynamic

361
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,860
programming so utilize dynamic

362
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,420
programming which basically just means

363
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,190
dividing your big problem into

364
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,380
subproblems so you have like this whole

365
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,670
chain and you're dividing it into

366
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,200
smaller units of problems to solve and

367
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,790
the other thing that it makes use of is

368
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,330
called the Monte Carlo method the Monte

369
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,490
Carlo method is is a heuristic search

370
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,610
tree more or less you have like a tree

371
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,339
where you say okay from this stage I

372
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:18,140
have four different actions and this

373
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,850
will lead me to this state and so on and

374
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,830
so on and at the end of the tree you

375
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,490
have values which are our rewards so

376
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:30,050
every time we tell our algorithm to

377
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,970
predict something it will look into the

378
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,820
tree and look basically do I have a

379
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,310
reward for this exact scenario if not

380
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,200
I'm going to choose a scenario that is

381
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,900
close to it and has give me a high value

382
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,850
so basically what temporal disinterring

383
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,600
does is it combines a heuristic like

384
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,870
search algorithm with machine learning

385
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,420
because it does if it doesn't find the

386
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,420
exact reward it will approximate it by

387
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,089
the other data it already has and it's

388
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,110
also ha alphago did a lot of stuff all

389
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,320
right

390
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,130
and so I googled like any good developer

391
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,949
would do and what I found was a library

392
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:11,780
called reinforced days yes there is

393
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,449
actually a reinforcement library for

394
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,040
JavaScript which is pretty awesome

395
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,300
because it also runs in the browser and

396
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,949
reinforced us was written by a guy I

397
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:23,959
forget his first name but his last name

398
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,400
at Kapaa team and he based it on a paper

399
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,660
on a scientific

400
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,540
for where people solve at hari games

401
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,900
with reinforcement learning a temporal

402
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,240
difference L&Q learning and that's

403
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,020
pretty cool so I was like yeah okay this

404
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,080
is perfect and it's also the only

405
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,040
reinforcement library for JavaScript I

406
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,440
didn't really have a choice

407
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,600
alright so the code then I'm going to

408
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,300
show you is that's basically the code so

409
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,930
you have the state but before it's a

410
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,020
civilized state then you ask the agent

411
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,390
the agent is from the library you ask it

412
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,090
to act on this state the agent will

413
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,120
return an action this action is zero one

414
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,580
two or three and then you do the action

415
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,870
it's like this is hidden in the

416
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,640
calculate what they expected you you

417
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,620
take the action and then you will give

418
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,510
it a reward and say learn from this

419
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,480
reward of course like I said this is one

420
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,070
state one action you can do a lot of

421
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,930
actions and then give a reward in the

422
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,290
end like i did i get it i gave my system

423
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,010
a reward at the end of the alpha game so

424
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,530
basically when I use this everything

425
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,560
that I have to do it boils down to what

426
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,960
reward should I get like the whole model

427
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,270
stuff is basically all in this reward

428
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,590
that's the only thing I need to take

429
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,620
care of so okay I'm going to work in

430
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,780
iteration because that's the easiest for

431
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,260
me so first iteration I decided that do

432
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,200
the simplest thing just give it the

433
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,850
score as a reward so I don't need to

434
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,860
implement anything myself and the score

435
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,080
like I said it's better the more you

436
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,870
merge so that's a pretty good indicator

437
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:11,360
all right um yes this is my graph honor

438
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,060
and as you can see there's really not

439
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,940
that much happening if we check the

440
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,930
average it's really not there's like

441
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,030
yeah it's higher here and average but

442
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,490
then it drops down a lot so there's not

443
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,760
really like learning intelligence that

444
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,330
that I could actually see there so like

445
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,090
okay I tried it doesn't work that great

446
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,310
let's just try to find another

447
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,720
reinforcement value or reward value

448
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,759
to see if there's like something better

449
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,980
okay um so second iteration was

450
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,409
basically the the task of finding a

451
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:52,110
better value because I was I believed in

452
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,700
the library I thought it was the correct

453
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,350
library just my reward wasn't that great

454
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,440
so I came up with the string tile rating

455
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,710
and the tile rating was the sum of all

456
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,340
values divided by the tile count and of

457
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,899
course everywhere where there's no tile

458
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:09,960
in my serialize area is zero but there's

459
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,000
actually no tile and those of course

460
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,470
don't count otherwise you always have to

461
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,649
divide by 16 so what's different between

462
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:23,070
the rating and the score if you just

463
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:36,629
doesn't I'm sorry okay okay well this

464
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:41,429
one working very well so you didn't see

465
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,100
any of this of course you don't know so

466
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,690
when we start let's say this is our

467
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,830
starting situation and then this is our

468
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,450
board we have a score of zero because we

469
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,889
just started the game the rating is two

470
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:55,529
point five because we have some the some

471
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:58,259
of the ties is 10 and you divided by 4

472
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,960
that's 2 point 5 when we now make a move

473
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,960
to the left I'd say this is the most of

474
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,960
that the two upper the twos have merged

475
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,049
into a 4 and the 4 that I that has a

476
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,240
green frame is the new 4 so this is a

477
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,360
tie that's what was added after the

478
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,509
action was taken to the single time what

479
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:20,159
we have now is we have a score of 4

480
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,679
because we merged those twos and we have

481
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,379
a rating of 3.5 so okay rating goes up

482
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:27,059
when you merge something and it also

483
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,149
goes up when when you ties are in it now

484
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:33,559
if you for example instead move down

485
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,139
what you have now is that the tools were

486
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:41,180
not merged they're like the truth

487
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,530
the bottom row and the fourth new of

488
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,080
course and now this time we have a score

489
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,210
of zero and the ratings two point eight

490
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,980
so the rating has changed the score

491
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,980
hasn't changed so that was basically my

492
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,080
idea was well it's a little bit

493
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,080
different and so maybe that might be

494
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,450
better for some reasons I wasn't

495
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,100
entirely sure I just want to try

496
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,190
something else also it's thinking if you

497
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,020
don't win because in the end it's about

498
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,880
do you win the game until you lose the

499
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,110
game and if like all the games you play

500
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,480
are basically all losers then there's

501
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,490
really no point in giving the reward

502
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,470
back because always the same reward as

503
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,110
thinking the next best thing is the

504
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,500
highest sum of tires but with the lowest

505
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,330
number of tires that's basically if you

506
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,450
just look at one single stage one that

507
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,060
has like a higher value but lowers low

508
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,220
lower number of tires would be better

509
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,890
than a board with a lot of numbers that

510
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,770
they're all like two or four okay so

511
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,050
this was the idea behind the rating I

512
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,390
tried it it wasn't that great it kind of

513
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,220
looked like the score before so I tried

514
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,060
other things and I came up with this

515
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,310
where the reward was basically the score

516
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,230
divided by the ever score times the

517
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,150
rating divided by the average rating and

518
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,030
the ever which was taken from the last

519
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,190
hundred game so it was not the complete

520
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,410
average it was just the last hundred two

521
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,920
if there is a tendency so that we can

522
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:15,320
use it all right and so then what I was

523
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,200
seeing there was basically that okay the

524
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,260
yellow line always looks like it doesn't

525
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,470
move but that's because the values are

526
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,480
pretty high up there it goes of five

527
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,420
point five almost so um but if we look

528
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,000
at the average okay I was shaking a

529
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,670
little bit because I increase the time

530
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,120
so it's like one value per hour but that

531
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,150
was just so I could see does that is

532
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,490
there anything happening and it looks

533
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,590
like actually there is some intelligence

534
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,800
that like the score does go up over time

535
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,820
which could be an indicator that we're

536
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,400
getting better but I'm not pretty sure

537
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,360
because as we've seen before

538
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,250
sometimes there is like a really high

539
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,860
peak but then it like drops down

540
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,620
immensely so I would have to run it even

541
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,560
longer I used to run during the night I

542
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,230
thought it would be an ass but I'm not

543
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,440
entirely sure now so gotta try for a

544
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,650
longer time maybe train for a few days

545
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,300
but there was something where I thought

546
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,280
okay this reward seems to be working

547
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,230
better than just the score so maybe I

548
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,820
leave the reward for now and then try

549
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,280
something else and then see how that

550
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,530
works and so I did a third iteration

551
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,340
okay okay I did a third iteration where

552
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,380
I played a lot around a little bit with

553
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,200
the meta parameters of my system and

554
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,150
what I did was the K the epsilon all the

555
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,300
time and the epsilon is the value for

556
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,220
the exploration value so if you have

557
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,290
high and high epsilon you do a lot of

558
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,540
random moves if you have a low epsilon

559
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,310
you don't you just do the moves that

560
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,600
you're comfortable with that you already

561
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,300
know so if you decayed over time it

562
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,010
means at the beginning you do a lot of

563
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,680
random moves but the more games you play

564
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,960
the more you stick to the ones that you

565
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
already know and I thought that this

566
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,680
might work pretty well maybe because

567
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,750
then I don't go all over the place I

568
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,490
already have the stuff that I know and

569
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,890
then just try to go that path also it

570
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,480
was recommended in documentation of the

571
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,580
framework okay um so how did that look

572
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,670
let's take a look here it looks more

573
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,320
jagged right as most thing has more

574
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,140
stuff happening so so yeah um I played

575
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,790
fine so maybe like it looks good right

576
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:37,230
yeah it's perfect I want so um yeah it

577
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,950
looks pretty nice but so maybe you

578
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,190
didn't notice it when you check those

579
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,830
the total scores you see that maybe

580
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,250
there is a tendency moving up but

581
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,530
overall the overall average is a bit

582
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,470
lower than if you just returned the

583
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,040
score as reward so there is learning but

584
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,650
it's starting from a worse point that if

585
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,300
you would just give it the score which

586
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,330
might be okay because over time you will

587
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,560
reach like the best

588
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,260
possible point but maybe you will never

589
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,950
reach it but I'm pretty confident that

590
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,210
this was a that was a pretty good run so

591
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,190
this is how far I've got me basically

592
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,650
yeah I didn't I didn't really need one

593
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,280
anything but I I learned something I

594
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,750
looked into it and I learned something

595
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,370
and I have came to a conclusion so what

596
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,550
I saw is that it seemed to be learning

597
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,190
in some way it seemed that there was

598
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,820
like a tendency of the score going up

599
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,430
over time but we have a few problems and

600
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,020
I think I'm not going to be able to fix

601
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,180
it with this particular framework with

602
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,460
this particular system the one thing is

603
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,470
that the board size is kept is there's

604
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:01,350
16 tile spaces and after a time it just

605
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,850
becomes very crowded on the board

606
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,920
because you always have to have you have

607
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,160
to have like a 512 I mean I have a 256

608
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,050
next to it and you need another 256 to

609
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,530
merge those two merge school so you need

610
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,600
a lot of tires laying around and it's

611
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,370
get really it gets really crowded and it

612
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,160
gets harder the higher you get and it

613
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,990
could be that it's just at some point

614
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,840
the system just does not I just can't

615
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,450
handle it anymore because it's just it

616
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,310
just doesn't know where where to put all

617
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,280
the tires basically and the other

618
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,530
problem is that my input is the sled so

619
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,890
it's a it's a one-dimensional array but

620
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,750
the board is not one dimension of two

621
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,750
dimensional but for this library there's

622
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,670
two snow there was no way to input

623
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,800
multi-dimensional inputs so I had to go

624
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,080
with it and I could imagine that my

625
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,030
system just didn't get that number like

626
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,280
element number zero and element number

627
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,830
four are like they can merge them when

628
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,900
you go up or down so this is something

629
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,630
that the system would have to learn in

630
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,340
implicitly and I'm not sure whether it

631
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,610
got there actually and so the other

632
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,940
thing about reinforced is that it has

633
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,160
one heart one hidden layer hard-coded

634
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,250
and I looked into the library and I was

635
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,450
thinking about like changing it but

636
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,210
like stuff broken once again I'm not

637
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,130
going to do that I'm just going to go

638
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:28,029
with what I have and just yeah hold on

639
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:32,049
tight basically but I heard the guy is

640
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:35,289
going to be and in Paris I think when

641
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:37,120
I'm going to be there too and then maybe

642
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,799
I can meet up with him and we can like

643
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,570
have program it or something it would be

644
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,519
cool right so what's next what will I do

645
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,179
next

646
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:49,510
when I'm got to get around to it I can

647
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,620
play around a little with the meta

648
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,149
parameters there are lots of meta

649
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,500
parameters that you have to give your

650
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,889
system those are the parameters so

651
00:28:56,889 --> 00:28:58,659
epsilon I already explained that right

652
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:01,269
the low epsilon means not as random high

653
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:03,399
as long means very random there's this

654
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:06,250
gamma thing that's also some kind of

655
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,429
greedy so if you're if you have low

656
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:12,789
gamma and that means that you try to get

657
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:15,610
the best possible reward instantly and

658
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,590
if you have a higher gamma you'll be

659
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,649
fine with doing a lot of stuff to get a

660
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:22,899
higher reward in the end so that's

661
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:24,159
something that you can play around with

662
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,139
there's a learning rate which you can

663
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,630
just try an error and try to find the

664
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,289
best thing

665
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,179
there's experience that you can make it

666
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:35,070
bigger whatever there's all kinds of

667
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,240
parameters and you can if you want to

668
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,490
get more into it you can check out

669
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,889
reinforced yes and they're explained in

670
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:45,370
a in a nice mathematical way which I

671
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,809
didn't include because it's kind of

672
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:47,350
complicated

673
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,919
and what else so I was thinking to

674
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,899
switch to Python Python has a lot of

675
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:55,510
nice machine learning frameworks and I

676
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,029
would be able to just do more to have

677
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,130
introduced more layers to try around a

678
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,440
little bit so that could also be

679
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,909
possible but then I couldn't run in the

680
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:05,590
browser so I haven't really decided on

681
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,289
that yet but one thing I could do is

682
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:10,389
something called convolutional net work

683
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:12,190
and the convolutional network is

684
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,820
basically a way for me to to tackle the

685
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,350
sled input problem because in a

686
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,960
convolutional network you could like

687
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,480
have four different nodes and each node

688
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,880
gets like one row or we have eight

689
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,710
different notes and then you have four

690
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,690
four rows and four four columns and they

691
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,090
will give all their values that they

692
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,930
calculated and give it to the net

693
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,760
network so that you can actually have

694
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,540
those kinds of relationships in the

695
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,760
horizontal relationships and vertical

696
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,350
relationships and the system book will

697
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,180
learn that yeah that's basically it so

698
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,980
that's basically what I what I did and

699
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,230
there are some links if you're

700
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,320
interested so the first one is open

701
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,570
source 2048 that's the game then there's

702
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,690
this unlife I didn't notice

703
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,390
so this is a paper where someone already

704
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,760
tried to do debrie enforcement learning

705
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,610
with Python will for the 2048 game I

706
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,180
think he just rewarded wins with won and

707
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,160
lost was with zero and said it didn't

708
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,220
work so well so you can look into it

709
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,870
what he did and it's pretty interesting

710
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,760
actually and then there's this

711
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,290
introduction to Temple distance learning

712
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,470
that's that's more of a scientific paper

713
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,480
but it's pretty it's still you can still

714
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,170
understand it and just for if I didn't

715
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,610
explain anything to well then maybe you

716
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,310
can look it up there and then yeah I can

717
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,710
presentation review address great

718
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:43,250
so um live demo so I will show you stuff

719
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,380
that I so I will let it run in the

720
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,040
backend I'm not gonna promise anything I

721
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,740
don't think it will do anything actually

722
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,810
but it's very hypnotic and it's it's

723
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:59,470
nice so I don't know it won't start

724
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,940
