00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,760
Jen Luker

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,760
PARISS: All right. So, before we welcome our
next speaker on stage, I want to give you

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,760
a few mind blowing fun facts about her. So,
she owns three spinning wheels. She thought

5
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,064
the movie Hackers was about her. Why, you
may ask? Before modems and AOL, she used to

6
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:07,860
hack into the telnet system at the University
of Utah so she could message a college student

7
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,770
in Sydney, Australia, that she befriended
through exploring the system. After the university

8
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,130
figured out that changing the password wasn't
going to stop her from hacking it, they give

9
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,320
her her own log in, which was pretty boss.
All right. So, weaving tapestries of code,

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
let's welcome Jen Luker.
[ Applause ]

11
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
JEN: Hey, everyone so\h this is getting to
the end of the last day. How has your conference

12
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,340
been? Nice? Awesome. Okay. So, weaving tapestries
of code. Now, this is gonna be a fun little

13
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,770
history lesson. Going on a bit of an adventure.
Before we get started, some of you are probably

14
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:34,180
asking, you know, textiles? Why textiles of
all the industries in all the world, why textiles?

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,250
I want to set up a little bit of a history
lesson before we get to the history lesson.

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,690
When we are looking at textiles. I want to
explain that it takes time to develop the

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:55,350
clothes that we all wear. Back in the mid
17th century, it actually cost about ten daysâ€™

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:05,460
worth of work, worth of pay, to pay for a
single shirt. So, if you were to take that

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,750
money and translate it to what we do today,
there are some calculations that essentially

20
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:20,950
say that this shirt would cost us between
3 and $5,000. So, we need a few updates that

21
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,530
actually did progress things quite a lot.
We came up with the spinning wheel. Which

22
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,630
like one tenth of the time that it took to
spin yarn, which was one of the largest chunks.

23
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,860
It dropped the time from 2300 hours to spin
the yarn for this shirt down to about 400

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,980
hours. The other portion was weaving this.
Because you're weaving ultra fine threads

25
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:48,230
in order to make something durable enough
to survive. Most people only bought an outfit

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:56,250
a year, maybe two. That's it. So, when we're
trying to consider the fact that that's how

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:06,030
expensive this shirt was... let's look at
these. So, mid 18th century. This was the

28
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,939
height of fashion in France. This is a ridiculous
amount of fabric in that even shows you some

29
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:19,280
of the undergarments\h not all\h but some
of the undergarments that the women wore.

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,129
These are highly textured, patterned, beautiful
pieces of work. Looking at this, this is the

31
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:38,019
most basic thing. 3 $5,000. This is unreal
as far as how much this cost. So, if you look

32
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:47,579
at how much time it took to develop 18th century
French silk brocade, this would take between

33
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:59,169
15 and 27 days of 12 hours a day of weaving.
Because a weaver could only do about 2 inches

34
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:06,110
per day. These patterns were highly complex.
It took two weavers. You had one person that

35
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:12,260
actually wove the thread and then you had
the other person who stood on top of the spinning\h

36
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:20,200
or the loom itself and actually picked up
the threads individually. So, this was absolutely

37
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,219
a bare minimum of a two person job. Taking
15 27 days. Just to make the fabric for the

38
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:40,900
outside garment. So, then we get to this picture
which is one of the most famous early computing

39
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,930
pictures ever. This hung on the wall of Charles
Babbage amongst others at the time. There

40
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,569
were not that many made. They were commissioned.
But they were highly incredible. Charles Babbage

41
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:59,519
used to have these really big parties. And
he'd invite all of the great names of the

42
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,180
day. Including the Duke of Wellington who
was known to be extremely, extremely smart.

43
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,760
And Charles Babbage kind of leaned on him
and would look at him and say, so, how do

44
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:20,910
you think this picture was made? And the Duke
of Wellington would look at this and he would

45
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,570
say, well, it looks a lot like a wood cut.
And if you look at this wood cut, it actually

46
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,420
does look a fair amount like that wood cut.
Except when you look deeper, it looks more

47
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,620
like your suit jacket than it does a wood
cut. And that's because everything from the

48
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,690
words on the bottom to the image itself to
the background is all woven using a Jacquard

49
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:55,880
loom. This took 24,000 cards to program. When
the average French silk brocade took about

50
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:06,840
4,000. It would take months to lay this out.
We got the French Jacquard loom starting in

51
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,130
December of 1800 was when the patent was given.
It was put into production in about 1801.

52
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,480
And it's a little bit misleading because it's
not just the loom that we're talking about.

53
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:26,340
It's basically that top box was the real innovation.
But there's really nothing on this loom that

54
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:38,930
was unique to Jacquard. In 1725, Bouchon had
developed his loom that used a piece of paper

55
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:45,650
that had punched holes in it to essentially
line up and set the process versus the drawlooms

56
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:53,460
in the day with warp threads that allowed
him to pick them up programmatically using

57
00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:04,061
rods. And in 1728, three years later, his
protege, Falcon, developed this one. Those

58
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:12,890
pieces of paper are really difficult, because
if one rips\h and they ripped all the time\h

59
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,710
if you misplaced is ever so slightly, it would
tear. You would have to re create the entire

60
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:25,300
piece of paper. By dividing them in two cards
and having the large holes on the side so

61
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,580
you can mount them in the places they need
to be. The positioning was much more accurate.

62
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,650
Much less likely to tear and if one did tear,
you could just replace one and sew it back

63
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:44,590
together. So, this was much more user friendly.
However, this still required two people because

64
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:53,780
you still needed someone to lift up the cords.
So, then we have the flying shuttle developed.

65
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:00,580
And I don't necessarily mean this shuttle.
However, I do mean this shuttle. The reason

66
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:09,310
I had the previous image is because this is
how it works. It shot the flying shuttle across

67
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:17,250
a room at 60 miles an hour. Preventing a user
from having to lift up each thread and moving

68
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:25,630
it back and forth. By being able to have those
things lifted, it did it for you. 20 years

69
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:37,750
later, almost, we have Vaucanson's loom. His
loom was the first automatic loom. Vaucanson

70
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:49,781
was actually an automaton, he made the tambourine
player and this is the digesting duck. This

71
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:56,620
is where we get, if it walks like a duck,
if it talks like a duck. In fact, some people

72
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:08,670
jokingly name this the defecating duck. Because
this duck would poop. So, if none of these

73
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:16,280
ideas are truly unique to Jacquard, why did
he get all the credit? The answer to that

74
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,790
is that he brought all of these pieces to
the. From Bouchon's system to lifting threads,

75
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:32,029
Falcon's card in a loop, Kay's flying shuttle
and the control system for switching cards,

76
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:38,190
that was the first time it was put together
in one piece. It was maybe not the first automated

77
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:50,920
one, but it was the very first user friendly
automated machine. Now, unfortunately, right

78
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,700
about this time, just shy of when this was
developed, we had the French Revolution. And

79
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,370
more specifically, we had the reign of terror.
It took 10 months to kill off one fifth of

80
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:09,870
the French population. 400,000 people died.
Now, though that hit most of the demographics

81
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:18,130
in France, it was towards the clergy and the
aristocracy. Which means that by the time

82
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:25,120
the Jacquard loom came out, nobody wanted
French silk brocade. So, what happened to

83
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:33,680
our Jacquard loom? Richard Roberts, who developed
every single one of the things on this list,

84
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,660
a wet gas meter, improved lathe, planing machine,
power loom, self acting spinning mule, we

85
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:47,300
could go from four threads\h what we could
do then\h up to 80 threads per machine. Dropping

86
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,230
what used to be 400 hoursâ€™ worth of work
into 9 minutes. The gear cutting machine,

87
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:02,260
the\helectro magnet and the punching machine.
He took Jacquard's loom, specifically the

88
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:12,500
head, and attached it to something that we
now know as a riveter. And because of Richard

89
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,420
Roberts, we not only have the first automatic
powered loom that no longer needs people to

90
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:30,230
sit there and weave. We also have industrial,
military ships. And bridges. And that's where

91
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:43,330
it went. All right. So, it only took a few
years, really, to get to a great majority

92
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,520
of the innovation. It took another 50 years
for that to really come into play. But once

93
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:56,660
it did, it very quickly jumped from an automated
loom into a powered loom. So, back to Charles

94
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,550
Babbage. One of the reasons why he was so
amazed by the Jacquard loom was because he

95
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:09,400
loved the punch cards. He wanted to develop
his machines to use these punch cards in order

96
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:17,270
to calculate numbers. His difference engine
number one was to calculate polynomial functions

97
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:26,410
to 16 digits. And it would also print out
those results for you as a test and then press

98
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:33,220
into a plate so that you could then print
those out later using a printing machine.

99
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,700
His analytical engine was supposed to be more
general purpose. It was supposed to be that

100
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,589
you could program this machine to perform
a calculation for you. And it didn't necessarily

101
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:50,490
matter which calculation. And after the development
of this engine kind of stalled. The difference

102
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,360
engine number one stalled, he only developed
the portion that you see on the left hand

103
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,779
side here. He really dug deep into the analytical
machine. And after the analytical machine,

104
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:10,030
he improved his difference engine to be accurate
to 31 digits. None of these were actually

105
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:17,500
built until 150 years later. For a while,
you could have seen this in San Francisco.

106
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,560
It's now in a private collection. However,
you can go online and see videos of how this

107
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,120
functions to this day. The machine weighs
5 tons. It's huge. And highly impractical.

108
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,360
There are 180,000 moving parts. But imagine
if this had actually come into fruition when

109
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:48,850
it was created. What if it had been 150 years
earlier? Someone else who attended his lectures

110
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:58,000
was Menabrea. He was a brilliant, brilliant
mathematician. Babbage gave a lecture at the

111
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,510
University of Turin on his analytical machine.
And Menabrea was the one who transcripted

112
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:16,550
that lecture. The lecture itself was in French.
So, he ended up hiring Ada Lovelace to translate

113
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,790
it back into English. Ada Lovelace, as many
of you probably know, is actually the daughter

114
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:28,270
of Lord Byron, and had a volatile relationship
with her mother. To the point that her mother

115
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:35,310
didn't let her learn art or poetry. She didn't
want her daughter to be like Lord Byron who

116
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:45,960
had a mental insufficiency or mental instability
streak. The problem, though, as strictly mathematical

117
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:53,750
as she was, she saw the world in a poetic
fashion. When she looked at the machine, she

118
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,950
looked at the drawings for that analytical
machine and saw what it could do, she realized

119
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:10,540
that machines are not meant just for calculating
numbers. That they could do so much more.

120
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:17,880
And that is her genius. That is her contribution.
She ended up publishing the work with enough

121
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,700
footnotes to be much longer than the actual
work that she transcribed in the first place.

122
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,390
She did have some help from Charles Babbage
regarding some of the details of the machine.

123
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:35,940
The algorithm that she developed was based
on a logic structure that previously existed.

124
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:49,750
So, again, she got a lot of credit because
she put it all together. So, quite a few years

125
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:58,930
later, another 50 or 60 years, we have Herman
Hollerith who at his doctorate thesis was

126
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:06,580
an electronic tabulating machine. The next
year, the very first census used punch cards

127
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:12,550
from his company to mark off each dot for
each person. And at that time it wasn't more

128
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:18,210
of a combination of dots equaled something
as much as this dot meant your gender. This

129
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:23,370
to the meant your demographic. This dot meant
where you lived. It was a little bit more

130
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:30,970
specific. All right. By 1911 his company,
combined with three other companies to make

131
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,880
a fifth company called computing tabulating
reporting company. Which a few years later

132
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:46,900
we now know as IBM. In 1928, IBM introduced
rectangular hole, 80 column format punch cards.

133
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:58,399
Which is why to this day our IDEs default
to 88 columns. All based on Jacquard loom

134
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:07,959
punch cards. So, from 1800 to 1924, something
that could have technically been developed

135
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:14,589
by 1840. We very well could have had the industrial
Revolution and the computing age much earlier

136
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:24,640
than we did. So, let's talk a little bit about
wartime efforts and knitting. This beautiful

137
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,470
quote I found says, during wartime, where
there were knitters, there were often spies.

138
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:35,779
A pair of eyes watching between the click
of two needles. And this was less because

139
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:43,149
knitting was used for code and more because
people didn't pay attention to knitters. Knitter

140
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:52,950
is grandma sitting in the corner. She's just
a woman, as they'd say. But those women were

141
00:16:52,950 --> 00:17:02,580
kind of incredible. So, the very first reference
to using knitting in code, or code in knitting,

142
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,569
was Madame Defarge from the Tale of Two Cities
written by Charles Dickens in 1859. He referred

143
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:14,360
to her\h she was just a blood thirsty woman
who would sit in the meetings where they were

144
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,780
arguing about who should be the ones to be
hauled off to the guillotine and she would

145
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:28,780
knit the names and stories of those people
into her projects. In all reality, though,

146
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:36,059
I have to say, Belgium had some of the coolest
knitters. There's one woman who parachuted

147
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:44,750
out of a plane, took her knitting with her,
biked around France and\h not just Belgium,

148
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,170
but France and Germany\h and would talk to
soldiers trying to be helpful and get information

149
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:55,980
from them. And then turn around and take that
information back. She was one of the few that

150
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,200
actually knit some of her information into
her work. All right. There's another Belgium

151
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:08,840
woman whose house and whose window sat over
train stations. And so, while she was sitting

152
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,470
there knitting, she would be tapping her foot.
And the foot tapping was in Morse code. And

153
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,990
she would be telling her children in the floor
below her what she was seeing out the window.

154
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,220
Which trains were going where, where they
were coming from, what they had in them, what

155
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:37,390
time it was, all while a German sergeant was
living in their house? Another woman based

156
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:43,100
on the speed at which she knit was able to
do the same thing except as opposed to using

157
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:49,910
her foot in Morse code, she would do a purl
stitch if it was a passenger train and she

158
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:55,960
would do a yarn over if it was a supply train
so they could record how often they came and

159
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:06,790
when they came based on her rate of knitting.
In World War II, the British Office of Censorship

160
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,400
banned people from posting knitting patterns
abroad because they were afraid that these

161
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,150
knitting patterns very well could have code
in them. And here's one of the reasons they

162
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:27,090
might have thought that. The sweater I'm wearing
today has two messages written into it. I

163
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:33,950
took the message, converted it to binary,
converted binary to knitting stitches and

164
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:42,370
knitted them into my sweater. So, in this
case, ones are knit stitches, zeros are purl

165
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:49,390
stitches. And yarn overs are the spaces in
between the eight characters it takes to make

166
00:19:49,390 --> 00:20:00,110
a letter. So, knitting and crocheting and
weaving and stitching and embroidery goes

167
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:07,380
much farther than just messages and punch
cards. There's some beautiful mathematical

168
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:15,020
things that we can do with crocheting, for
instance. So, look at the middle picture.

169
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:22,521
The top one has two parallel lines. This is
what we know as parallel lines. They are two

170
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:29,980
straight lines that will never cross. But
in hyperbolic knitting, all three of those

171
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:37,930
intersecting lines on the top are parallel
to the line below it. And when this woman,

172
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:48,460
Daina , asked, how? Why? Her teacher said,
imagine it. Because we can't show you. And

173
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:55,900
it wasn't until 20 years later when she had
to teach hyperbolic physics and geometry that

174
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,500
she really looked deeply and discovered that
it was a crocheting pattern she was looking

175
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:08,490
at. So, she started crocheting and playing
with it a bit and this is what we came up

176
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,620
with. This is one of the first versions and
this is what she took to her students and

177
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:18,840
said, look, if you fold along these lines.
They never intersect. It's not that these

178
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,720
are straight lines. It's that they are straight
on the plane themselves. If you fold it into

179
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,280
a straight line, that's what they are. But
if you look at them in comparison to the line

180
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:39,110
below it, they suffer so that they never touch.
They curve into each other and out. It wasn't

181
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:47,760
until 1990s that we were able to actually
visualize hyperbolic geometry. Because crocheting

182
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,660
is the only form of fabric that actually allows
us to play with it and interact with it and

183
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:06,100
see it for the first time. Another version
of this is the Lorenz Manifold. Though the

184
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:13,700
hyperbolic geometry was the first time a crocheting
pattern was printed in a scientific journal,

185
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,940
this was the second only a few years later.
All right. So, this is a simplified model

186
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,820
of equations describing the rising and cooling
of hot air. Otherwise known as thermal convection

187
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:34,980
in the atmosphere. But this is the only way
that we have been able to determine that we

188
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,799
can visualize these things. That we can play
with them and move them and swirl them and

189
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:52,419
see them in a way that's stable. And in this
sense, these fiber arts, these things that

190
00:22:52,419 --> 00:23:04,460
old women knit while nobody paid attention
to them, were the ways to discover mathematics.

191
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,200
Something that a lot of people are really
familiar with because we wear them a lot these

192
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,260
days is infinity columns. They're Moebius
strips. But something we have a lot of difficulty

193
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:23,871
interacting with it w is a Klein bottle, which
is a three dimensional Moebius strip. Every

194
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:29,340
side is the outside. Every side is the inside.
You can put your finger on one spot and wrap

195
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:39,380
all the way around and touch every surface
without lifting. Without folding into an inside.

196
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:49,270
And beyond mathematics, we also have data
visualization. There's something impactful

197
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:57,030
about having color and texture in front of
you like this. This scarf is not actually

198
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:05,039
every day and one year. It's one day for a
hundred years. This is defining what global

199
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:13,550
warming looks like over time. In another one,
they decided to map their sleep patterns of

200
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:19,809
their children. When they were babies. Their
first year. And they can see how they went

201
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:28,309
from very erratic and who knows when to something
much more stable. And in the third one, a

202
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:33,020
woman who really, really hated her commute
some days and was loving it on others would

203
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:39,840
knit different colors based on what the delay
was that day. And that ended up selling on

204
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:55,049
eBay for $8600. Right? And sometimes the art
itself can be the technology. All right? This

205
00:24:55,049 --> 00:25:06,250
is actually functioning pianos. Functioning
keys. Functions sensor. And just touch and

206
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:11,720
gesture motion sensors. Or sometimes it's
just a QR code to allow you to connect to

207
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:28,670
the Wi Fi. But my question at this point is,
is knitting a programming language? How far

208
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,380
have we really come with this? And if you
look at knitting, there's really only these

209
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,470
three stitches. Unlike crocheting there's
hundreds, thousands. Same thing with embroidery.

210
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,740
Knitting only has these three. May do them
in different orders, may knit three together.

211
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:53,620
But in the end, it's just a knit stitch. And
the purl is an opposite side of a knit stitch

212
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:01,169
so you're just doing it backwards. And a warn
over is just a way to make space. Which is

213
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:16,560
how I made this sweater. Knowing that, how
many of you can read this? Okay. This is a

214
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:30,150
full knitting language. This is\h this is
the\h this is in fact us programming. We have

215
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,220
to figure out so many things in our heads.
Like, how many multiples and then how many

216
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:41,800
we have to add. We have asterisks, we have
parentheses, we have two last stitches. And

217
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:50,840
if you really, really look at this, you'll
recognize that this is what it is. All we're

218
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,530
doing is we're saying, we have a couple\h
we have some stitches that we have to do before

219
00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:03,630
the loop starts. And then we have our loop.
Or a do while in this case. Do purl one knit

220
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:13,760
three where we have more than three stitches
left. And then we purl one and two. So, though

221
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:23,640
this pattern actually shows how we knit every
row, the entire project, including the entire

222
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:50,820
brocade stitch, is on my GitHub repo. Let's
see if this will let me do it. Nope. So, this

223
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:59,400
is essentially how it works. So, if you take
those stitches and we say we want 18 inches.

224
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:07,299
And we knit 6 stitches per inch and we want
our diamond brocade stitch, it prints out

225
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:11,941
not only how many cast on stitches that fit
within those eight stitches, plus one. But

226
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:20,559
also every knit and purl that's in those repeats.
So, we could either do this...

227
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:44,590
Or we could do that. So, I have one last quote
for you. From a lovely woman named Linda Liukas.

228
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:50,750
She has a really energetic TED Talk that's
just magical. I highly recommend you watch

229
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,410
it. There's a link on the slides. And near
the middle, she said and that's why no one

230
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,740
recognized that when I was conjugating French
or irregular verbs, I was actually practicing

231
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,049
my pattern recognition skills. And when I
was excited about knitting, I was actually

232
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:09,831
following a sequence of symbolic commands
that included loops inside of them. And that

233
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:15,190
Bernard Russell's lifelong quest to find an
exact language between English and mathematics

234
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:27,309
found its home inside a computer. I was a
computer programmer. But nobody knew it. We

235
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:38,090
went from an 18th century fashion fad in France
all the way to mathematics and science and

236
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:46,520
is knitting a programming language? I have
two points that I wanted to make. One, is

237
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,120
we all stand on the shoulders of giants. And
just because your idea may not be absolutely

238
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,580
unique in every fashion, doesn't change the
fact that it's yours and it's important and

239
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:03,600
it should be heard. And the other is that
sometimes you have to step away from the computer

240
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:13,970
and play with something to truly discover
something unique. I'm Jen Luker. You can find

241
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:20,270
me on Twitter. And if you want to know more
information, I have quite a few. Please come

242
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,960
talk to me. Thank you.
