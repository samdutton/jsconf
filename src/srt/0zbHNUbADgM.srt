CSS and css3 and the CSS comp is part of

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,979
the CSS conf organization now it's a

20
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,900
whole organization originally inspired

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,080
by Nicole Sullivan for CSS comp in

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,830
florida in 2011 our 2013 excuse me and

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,170
is expanded so far has inspired so many

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,530
other conferences so the past this past

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,320
year they've had CSS conf changed over

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,290
from Florida to New York where I'm from

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,759
and that was this past year it was an

28
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,829
amazing event and some multiple people

29
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,479
from which none of that are here today

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,310
as well we have CSS conf Australia which

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,210
I've heard and quoting here strongly

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,770
believe it might happen again maybe

33
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,630
around march or april of next year so

34
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,790

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,410
fun and hopefully it might happen again

41
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,770

57
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,010
we're here in amazing Berlin this is

58
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,060
actually my first time absolutely

59
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,980
outside the United States and it's been

60
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,620
an awesome week that I've been here it's

61
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,770
amazing to visit Berlin and see the

62
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,990
places and all the all the great food

63
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,720
and touristy things that I've been able

64
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,360
to do and great coffee by the way but

65
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,040
we're also hearing this amazing radio

66
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,990
systems boom I think I pronounced that

67
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:41,270
correctly ish and it may be wonder what

68
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,459
happened to the other four radio systems

69
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,290
I mean we're here the fourth way

70
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,520
especially the third one we're going to

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,730
keep in theme with three today and so r

72
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,620
audio system that I happen to be very

73
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,350
appropriate for the name maybe not

74
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,320
location or a waterworks factory for

75
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,209
those that don't get it try desert

76
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,350
speaking of dry humor and we're going to

77
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:17,280
go onto movie puns so Dhaka

78
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,230
so I wanted to look into the movie

79
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,740
trilogies inspired by css3 starting with

80
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,040
Mad Max with beyond pundir dome to give

81
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,480
you a little hint of what we're going

82
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,390
for today although as chrissy pointed it

83
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,600
out CSS com3 did not wait till the 4th

84
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,240
one to equal out as gender diversity and

85
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,680
get that going this event was almost

86
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,030
return of the JED if anyone and however

87
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,890
you couldn't make it this year so I came

88
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,440
up and took his place some of the people

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,730
the audience who might recognize that

90
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,500
this is actually the sixth movie

91
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,590
technically but if you look closely at

92
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,720
the third one it's actually returned to

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,370
the six so that's a little strange and

94
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,250
you'll see that in CSS as revenge of the

95
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:13,760
sixth and we're also in the EU in Europe

96
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,390
and so we want to show the European

97
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,920
movie series that have been inspired by

98
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,430
CSS including before midnight and our

99
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,330
favorite three color series of FFF and

100
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,860
also we had those old school movies I've

101
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,480
been really coming out but actually may

102
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,430
have kind of guess what's going on in

103
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,070
the future the good the bad and the in

104
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,930
line and I think one of Judge Smith's

105
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,630
personal favorites Indiana Jones and the

106
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,150
Last cascade so I believe it's happening

107
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,160
it's coming i mean CSS is dead if you've

108
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,920
heard from anyone i'm kidding it's just

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,520
God if speakers go on a little bit too

110
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,140
long today we're going to have to cut

111
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,640
them off for in other words at words end

112
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:15,010
oh yeah oh yeah one grown we got it and

113
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,470
also coming up in the future of CSS

114
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,070
might be the rising machines if anyone's

115
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,700
seen the grid io yet it's happening it's

116
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,510
they're taking over

117
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,270
and of course one of my favorite sci-fi

118
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,530
flicks matrix revolutions or with these

119
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,850
days matrix 3d revolutions of course

120
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,170
Michael Bay's always been a big fan of

121
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,790
CSS if y'all didn't know the

122
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,340
Transformers series has been one of my

123
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:52,110
favorites I was a little stretch and so

124
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,070
today there's me a lot going on and so I

125
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,120
want to go over the schedule real quick

126
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,510
as we had this morning me up here and we

127
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,220
have a couple speakers and then coffee

128
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,230
and then a couple speakers and then

129
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,300
lunch and then a couple speakers and

130
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,460
then more coffee and a couple speakers

131
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,090
then coffee and cake so the plan will

132
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,830
have closing remarks at a family photo

133
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,500

134
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,980

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,930
keep track of all those sets this URL

136
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,270

137
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,690

138
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,700

from I've known her for quite a while

140
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,260
now and it's been a joy to hang out with

141
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,580
her in New York and all the events that

142
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,740
