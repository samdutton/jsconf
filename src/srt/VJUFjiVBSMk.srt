1
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,080

how's it going everybody

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,270
I don't know if this is working okay

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,170
cool

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,850
so my name is Aman this is I see my

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,710
first time in LA I'm originally from

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,840
Cincinnati I came down here for this

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,810
talk sorry

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,250
oh thank you this is also I did not know

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,109
was gonna be this many of you guys I

10
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:31,340
thought was gonna be like 20 people the

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,610
usual case but this is awesome so like I

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,320
said my name is Aman I studied physics

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,890
at University of Cincinnati I now work

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,199
for this company data czar and before I

15
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:44,629
get into d3 and the awesomeness of d3 I

16
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,100
want to talk to you guys about what we

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,870
do a little bit so we can be a little

18
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,479
context so days are is a research

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,799
collaboration or data collaboration

20
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:54,040
platform we allow people to upload data

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,449
analyze that make visualization and

22
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:57,470
stuff like that and then share it back

23
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,750
to whoever uploaded the data so you can

24
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,879
kind of see context and I guess that is

25
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,750
not working okay

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,880
can you guys hear anything now yeah how

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,240
about now I'm trying to hold it you got

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,960
it now good good good

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,140
Oh awesome okay all right which part

30
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,870
should I say again I'm just kidding so

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,550
these are a research collaboration

32
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,530
platform where we allow people to upload

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,690
data or share here back make

34
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,250
visualizations and v3 and stuff like

35
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,590
that so you can kind of see how a data

36
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,390
evolved from the beginning so goes from

37
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,700
raw data set to being prepared to being

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,230
analyzed to being visualized and then

39
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,909
share back what you found and the whole

40
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:45,950
idea was are people gonna get the same

41
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,780
results if they use one of the same

42
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,760
analysis platforms they use the same

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,950
methods and what's gonna be the

44
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,159
difference at the end right and so the

45
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,870
whole reason we kind of started was the

46
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,670
whole research process now was

47
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,840
completely messed up

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,110
all right especially because it's very

49
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,720
old-school I'd say for us a little bit

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,970
so you you do your analysis young you do

51
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,310
you view your data collection you

52
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,900
analyze it whatever from a network

53
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,670
analyzer or whatever it is and I'm gonna

54
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,010
be really physics specific here just cuz

55
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,390
that's what I know

56
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,250
you do that and then you analyze li

57
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,720
visualize them and you send it to your

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,580
advising professor or whoever it is your

59
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,710
team their an email and you upload it to

60
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,350
Dropbox and then at the end you finally

61
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,940
share it then in the middle you've

62
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,190
completely lost a lot of things all the

63
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,630
context you know how you went from point

64
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,540
A to point B what methods you use unless

65
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,040
you specifically specify that and

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,410
whatever you're sending right and so we

67
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,970
said okay let's make this very simple

68
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,700
you upload your data through either API

69
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,860
or interface and then you you

70
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,209
collaborate the site where you're gonna

71
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,950
add a lighter and why not and then you

72
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,070
analyze it using whatever it is showing

73
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,420
all the steps that you're taking and

74
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,000
then finally share it and if somebody

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
else sees that if somebody comes in the

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,790
middle of the research project they can

77
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,350
see exactly where you left off where

78
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,360
you've done to get to that step right so

79
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,480
you wanted everything to be in line all

80
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,330
right enough about that and then at the

81
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,580
end for us was if somebody used the

82
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,930
statement let's say for example somebody

83
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,910
use temperature data from NASA to you

84
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,530
know work on global warming especially

85
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,520
wanted the projects were working on

86
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,830
somebody else uses it for economics and

87
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,209
somebody else use it for healthcare

88
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,950
somebody else use it for whatever we

89
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,360
wanted to see how these different topics

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,070
related to each other it's really

91
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,600
interesting you can see some topics are

92
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,180
closer than you think even if you did

93
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,890
not see look at the data right economics

94
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,299
might be really close to physics or do

95
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,019
whatever if you guys go to here you can

96
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,880
guys can see all the data you don't have

97
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,970
to sign up you just get that okay so d3

98
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,459
the reason we started with d3 was people

99
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,100
who when people were uploading data they

100
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,690
were leaving the platform a lot of the

101
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,579
times just to analyze this data and then

102
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,989
they would come back and it was lose a

103
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,239
lot of stuff in between so he said ok

104
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,280
what would it take to let people analyze

105
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,769
data on our platform obviously the

106
00:03:57,769 --> 00:03:59,540
obvious answer first was Jupiter right

107
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,950
you could have notebooks Python in art

108
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,380
but we said ok how about we use Java

109
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,120
scripts that can kind of give us a kick

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,410
and everybody knows JavaScript that's

111
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,420
really you know out there and d3 is

112
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,790
really awesome so we said ok let's do

113
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,000
that let's work on JavaScript but the

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,210
problem right

115
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,150
the problem was a lot of these d3 and

116
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,010
announces that were being made were kind

117
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,600
of one-off right people would make them

118
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,790
right hundred lines of code if you

119
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,170
wanted to use that same thing for your

120
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,790
own analysis it would not work right

121
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,580
it's very very project specific so we

122
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,170
said how about we obstruct it a little

123
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,730
bit and let people use each other's code

124
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,540
right and there was this wonderful thing

125
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,150
right we create our own programming

126
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,830
language and we say okay we're gonna let

127
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,500
people abstract

128
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,210
d3 modules and then we're gonna let

129
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,620
other people call those modules and

130
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,790
match it with whatever data they're

131
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,670
doing right so he said people will be

132
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,320
able to write you know point plot

133
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,700
function and then you will get somebody

134
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,590
else's data on the platform and then you

135
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,330
can plot that in real time while you're

136
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,190
on the platform so our whole thing was

137
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,720
people should not be leaving our

138
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,070
platform to do whatever they were doing

139
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,180
so this is kind of what looked like he

140
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,710
would this is a kind of a mix we have

141
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,700
structured it a little bit in the

142
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,110
beginning as well it's kind of a mix of

143
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,320
raw JavaScript and d3 so people would

144
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,540
make this this module they would write

145
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,670
it on the on our platform using d3 which

146
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,290
is already included as a library and

147
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,720
then you can even test it as a test file

148
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,420
here and then somebody would call that

149
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,120
function from our from our platform

150
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,540
right you know zoom in here a little bit

151
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,550
for the code so our code is very very

152
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,080
very simple I would even call a

153
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,400
programming language is more kind of

154
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,990
like these commands you would send to

155
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,450
get back these outputs so you would say

156
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,640
okay I want I want to visualize this

157
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,580
data set and here is this and I want to

158
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,770
use this d3 code specific code if you

159
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,820
see there the line plot the that you

160
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,880
mean the the line plot function I would

161
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,350
say okay my user name and then the line

162
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,300
plot function and then that would plot

163
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,660
me whatever this is right this is just a

164
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,510
random numbers being visualized so we

165
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,770
got a little bit more complex people

166
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,660
were building these modules and then you

167
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,000
would call them and then the biggest

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,500
problem came people had to learn how to

169
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,080
write a new language and people had had

170
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,390
to know how to make d3 modules and so

171
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,420
this was a complete failure right people

172
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,800
were not making this need to not want to

173
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,050
learn a new language there was they said

174
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,340
okay why not use our why not use

175
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,950
mathematic

176
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,140
why not using that lab we just wanted

177
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,790
people to stay but they would and so

178
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,860
what what we did now was we said okay

179
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,450
that did not work so how can we still

180
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,480
let people use JavaScript and still be

181
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,120
able to plot data on our platform all

182
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,410
right and so we went more into into

183
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,180
templates instead of using our own

184
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,770
language so let's say for example you

185
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,110
take this raw data set this is like this

186
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,730
is a temperature data we got from NASA

187
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,070
here's the expanded view and then we

188
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,690
said okay even if it's horrible let's

189
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,840
just let people write lines of code to

190
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,420
analyze this data set so here's that

191
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,980
just to plot this function this this

192
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,440
data all right that's just one month you

193
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,120
would have to write all of that just to

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,160
do one thing if we did it in our own

195
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,480
programming language all of that would

196
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,830
be extracted for you only thing you to

197
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,180
do is just give it that pointer that a

198
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,560
file and then you just plot it

199
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,510
automatically right but that didn't work

200
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,550
still people did not want to learn in

201
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,770
language here's another one here's a

202
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,170
he's another templated function here

203
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,570
this is plotting each month of the same

204
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,820
data set and this is kind of where we

205
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,050
want to go at the end of the day is

206
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,760
people are not leaving the platform that

207
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,230
you're just doing it in real time on the

208
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,250
platform right there right without

209
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,630
having to leave anything and then you're

210
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,890
still at the same time showing people

211
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,640
how you did it

212
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,470
people can see you see your source code

213
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,000
they can see what data point you use you

214
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,070
can see how you analyze that because a

215
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,750
lot of the times when you're doing

216
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,540
especially computational stuff you want

217
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,130
to see under the hood of that

218
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,260
mathematical function all right what is

219
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,000
that actually doing does that differ

220
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
from platform to platform right

221
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,880
especially when you get to higher

222
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,590
numbers if you want to get more accurate

223
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,720
to what extent is that approximating and

224
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,240
stuff like that to it so our our whole

225
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,150
vision is can people because people can

226
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,350
see more and more of the code they can

227
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,520
see under the hood they can see under

228
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,560
the hood of the functions would it be

229
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
better for the whole community right it

230
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,470
will be better if you can see for how I

231
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,980
got from point A to point B and there's

232
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,450
a lot there's a huge culture of just

233
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,040
showing the end results and not showing

234
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,260
what you've done before so we kind of

235
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,520
wanted to get rid of that it's a huge

236
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,140
huge problem and we're not gonna be able

237
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,210
to fix anytime soon but we think this is

238
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,839
a good start

239
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,900
here's another one and so when you save

240
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,820
these files you can see you can see

241
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,050
exactly how somebody did it and they're

242
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,430
saved just like any other file you can

243
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,260
download this file just like any other

244
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:55,220
file you would in a platform and so

245
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,550
here's another one so a few weeks ago

246
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,410
somebody was a few weeks a few months

247
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,720
ago actually somebody uploaded where

248
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,970
every meteorite has hit in the world

249
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,180
since like the 1700s we got that data we

250
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,580
plotted it using d3 and this is kind of

251
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,650
what we want happening on a bigger scale

252
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,780
right I upload some things everybody

253
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,160
else goes on the platform to analyze

254
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,570
something and then we would get back

255
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,400
results can we match this with something

256
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,360
else and can we predict stuff can we can

257
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,530
we see that how this has affected

258
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,390
something else right this is kind of the

259
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,970
bigger picture of our of our whole thing

260
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,070
but again I kept saying like we want to

261
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,510
go back to JavaScript that's just cuz

262
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,070
everybody knows it and it's more

263
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,380
comfortable to write in I think at least

264
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,360
we will be supporting Jupiter just

265
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,010
because it's a really high demand right

266
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,310
now for us and our as well and be

267
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,780
writing SDKs for all these other

268
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,180
languages but there's another example of

269
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,490
using d3 and all this is open source

270
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,080
open and open source you guys can go

271
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,780
check it out so next we'll be

272
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,900
integrating mass J is probably one of

273
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,530
the craters here mats JSON d3 so we want

274
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,880
to not only just visualize because

275
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,950
visualizations are just literally the

276
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,960
end of what you do in a research process

277
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,030
you have to do all the computation all

278
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,010
the analysis all the cleaning so we kind

279
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,390
of want to integrate that expand it a

280
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,610
little bit and see if we can do a lot of

281
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,440
the computational stuff also before we

282
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,290
get to the visualizations

283
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,880
that's it and here's my contact

284
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,220
information if you guys want I'll open

285
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,450
up for questions in a little bit and

286
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,120
talk a little bit more but so far is

287
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:43,410
there any questions no animation yeah I

288
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,230
mean do you know if we support it yeah I

289
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,760
mean anything you write so actually

290
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,580
didn't show up as PDF what anything

291
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,960
you're right here will be displayed if

292
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,550
it's animation or whatever it is

293
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,870
yeah we'll display everything at some

294
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,920
point we're gonna have to start checking

295
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,470
what kind of code it is just cuz it's a

296
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,270
little disruptive sometimes what yeah

297
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,280
anything is supported as long as your

298
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:09,350
browser handles it yeah oh

299
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:27,710
the signup URL

300
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:37,660
there's any question yeah interesting

301
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,490
so whenever we release a data set the

302
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,690
most common thing we see is just people

303
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,490
analyzing a data differently using

304
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,500
different platforms so we usually see

305
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,330
somebody do it in our somebody do it in

306
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,640
Python usually they look like the same

307
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,150
results

308
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,140
so just people using different platforms

309
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,400
there's also animations and stuff like

310
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,040
that we've just kicked this off about

311
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,310
three two months ago so we haven't seen

312
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,160
that much but it's pretty good we all

313
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,960
like we haven't pushed out a lot of data

314
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,880
a lot of the data we have is so we have

315
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,550
Olympics data all the data from NASA

316
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,860
city of Cincinnati Ohio and stuff like

317
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,000
that we haven't we haven't come here yet

318
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:38,680
we will most all of the ten secrets to

319
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,990
writing perfect code that I'm gonna tell

320
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,940
you tonight have previously been covered

321
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,780
@j SLA so here we go number one practice

322
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,210
practice practice practice just like

323
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,800
everything else in life that's

324
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,500
challenging and rewarding you need to

325
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,080
practice so you can practice with online

326
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,690
tools like node school or you can attend

327
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,670
to the upcoming node school or you can

328
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,830
do things like hacker ring you can also
