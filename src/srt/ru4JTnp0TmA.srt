1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820

alright so yeah we're actually doing

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,080
that that's a real thing we're going to

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:13,250
do

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,170
it wasn't this part is yeah everyone

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:01:24,639
knows that this part is everybody

6
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:29,160
that real people

7
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,060
all right those my talk thanks it wasn't

8
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,540
actually my clock but I that's all I got

9
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,360
now so that was kind of I when I

10
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,830
proposed this talk i was like i'm going

11
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,300
to totally go into like the virtual

12
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,920
reality thing from jurassic park and i

13
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,350
was like kind of bullshitting but then i

14
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,640
had to make it real because i put it in

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,550
a github issue so I'm so we'll be

16
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,140
talking about this but just keep that in

17
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,160
the back of your mind okay and this was

18
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,600
another thing I was kind of joking about

19
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,760
what I'm going to make it real did you

20
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,750
hear when they were kind of doing the

21
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,400

kidding just kidding keep going

26
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,100
throughout the entire presentation so my

27
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,020
talk is navigating virtual worlds in

28
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,600
cyberspace with virtual reality modeling

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,560
language right here vrml or verbal this

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,989
is a real vermel its berlin or the

31
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:49,730
virtual cyber pakka lips the death and

32
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,330
return of VR or how VR Mel was kind of

33
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,070
ridiculous but also totally right all

34
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,270

40
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,900
2000 of zappos com this is real I think

41
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,209

42
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:22,250
know I didn't work there I take no

43
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,430

48
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,440
gamble which is probably why you're in

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,769
vegas in the first place yeah so let's

50
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,420
take things back a little bit i know

51
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:41,750
that

52
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,000
is d HTML cough 2000 and all but we're

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,190
going to take it way back the gear is

54
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,970
1995 you guys knew that whatever it's a

55
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,150
guy guys according to the billboard

56
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,400
music charts at the end of the year

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,330
gangsta's paradise was the number one

58
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,010
song that's still in my car a virtual

59
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,490
reality was kind of everywhere there

60
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,580
were like 87 million movies that either

61
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,280
used or like alluded to or in some way

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,570
had something to do with virtual reality

63
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,480
you had like Lawnmower Man the net like

64
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,900
hackers I mean it was a crazy time

65
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,060
everybody was getting into the game

66
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,769
including various me then he would have

67
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,800
a virtual boy wow that's amazing it's

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,900
coming back at the end of this

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,340
presentation get here ready don't worry

70
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,350
about it the virtual reality it was kind

71
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,780
of this like huge clunky thing this is a

72
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,220
video I couldn't get to load right so I

73
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,270
turned it into like a 16 megabyte gif

74
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,850
gif not jiff so like there were news

75
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,290
reports and like I guess he's a reporter

76
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,790
and they're like strapping him into this

77
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,229
machine but like the game's kind of

78
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,360
looked like this this is dactyl

79
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,760
nightmare the decals going to come hold

80
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,250
on Oh

81
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,300
so that's a dactyl I guess the rest of

82
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,390
it's the nightmare but this is the kind

83
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,710
of thing like you would go to the mall

84
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,380
and pay like way too much money to strap

85
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,000
in and then you would never be able to

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,560
figure out how to do anything and then

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,170
the dactyl I don't know but this was

88
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,630
kind of a thing everybody really thought

89
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,600
that VR was going to take off so why

90
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,700
wouldn't you have some way to describe

91
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,160
it right so this virtual reality

92
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,110
modeling language initially known as

93
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,260
virtual reality markup language not at

94
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,070
all related to HTML but I think they

95
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,550
kind of wanted to cash in on that so if

96
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,320
virtual reality was going to be like the

97
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,150
big thing right like this this makes

98
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,200
perfect sense but you got to remember

99
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,300
like this was the Internet of 1995 like

100
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,800
this is a real thing so this this is an

101
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,450
actual quote I want everyone to kind of

102
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,530
take a look at this and we'll examine

103
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,470
some key points this is a quote from the

104
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,390
from the vrml spec version 1.0 see they

105
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,980
are rendered everyone say rendered

106
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,380
sensually if something is represented

107
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,330
sensually it is possible to make sense

108
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,820
of it vrml is an attempt how successful

109
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,070
only time and effort will tell to place

110
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,280
humans at the center of the internet so

111
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,600
that's all right um yeah that's what it

112
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,780
is right I think I know this sounds

113
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,030
ridiculous but I swear it kind of makes

114
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,370
sense because remember remember the

115
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,730
Internet of 1995 it doesn't make any

116
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,450
sense who used hot metal ever that's a

117
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,990
hell of a HTML editor like it was a

118
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,790
really terrible place and like let's go

119
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,420
back to pizza just take that end if if

120
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,700
you have never used the internet or if

121
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,020
it was like this crazy thing or you'd

122
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,820
like here the kids talking about surfing

123
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,310
like the websphere or whatever like you

124
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,770
didn't know how any of the shit worked

125
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,150
just a really basic thing like how do

126
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,950
you go to a website was a mystery when

127
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,500
there's all of this nonsense going on so

128
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,810
I think the rml was a good step in that

129
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,940
direction I promise so we're going to

130
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,200
come back to this because I said that I

131
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,350
would I think that this is really

132
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,440
along the same lines did you know that

133
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,130
this is a like a real program this is

134
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,900
the thing that there's there's an open

135
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,340
source version now you can like brew

136
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,320
install it and it's like depending on if

137
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,870
you're like have the right c compiler in

138
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,220
the right like phase of the moon or

139
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,900
whatever like you could run this shit

140
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,600
this is like browsing a file system and

141
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,660
I think it's a UNIX system I know this i

142
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,580
really think that there was a fear of

143
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,680
like taking these abstract concepts like

144
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,570
navigating a file system or going to a

145
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,280
website or buying something online or

146
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,620
ordering a pizza or whatever and you

147
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,060
really wanted to relate that to human

148
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,070
things like if you say like go to a

149
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,840
folder well by god you're going to a

150
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,480
folder you are flying to it and shining

151
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,150
a light on it and going to it so i think

152
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,980
vemos really kind of the same thing but

153
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,800
for the internet here is a real doe shit

154
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,070
via remote client it's awesome and i

155
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:10,400
love it blaxland right yeah okay so you

156
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,990
could actually move around in this world

157
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,580
and you could talk to people and you

158
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,030
could what are they talking about I

159
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,700
don't know whatever terrible stuff I

160
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,940
don't know this is a and I've kept this

161
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,450
iframe at 800 x 600 for like the real

162
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,760
experience but you could you could go to

163
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,880
these worlds and it wasn't just like

164
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,169
when you talk to chatting people online

165
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,910
like this is really your going to go

166
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,919
like to their like castle house and you

167
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,300
will chat with them and it's a real

168
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,469
you're there you are in two rooms or an

169
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:45,950
executive office or kessel haunted which

170
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,420
might be my favorite so there was a

171
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,460
variety of vrml browsers and like

172
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,990
looking there's a bunch here and these

173
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,160
websites are all still let these are

174
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,620
just iframes that I'm in bedding there's

175
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,080
like a bunch right keep in mind how many

176
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,790
there are here because this is another

177
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,690
thing that's going to come up later

178
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,280
there was kind of a lot of things that

179
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,620
people hadn't like they weren't taking

180
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,810
it for granted like does anyone even

181
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,420
ever say like my avatar maybe like if

182
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,770
you're customizing your character and

183
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,120
like World of Warcraft or so that maybe

184
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,160
it comes up but there are a lot of like

185
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,470
really deep very well thought out

186
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,089
spiritual things people

187
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:26,389
writing about avatars man like you'd go

188
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,639
on a journey and like you wouldn't have

189
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,379
to be like whatever you would choose

190
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,180
your avatar like if you wanted to be

191
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,920
like a fish or I think that's Crash

192
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,059
Bandicoot I don't know a bowling ball

193
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,939
like you could be whatever you wanted to

194
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:47,029
be in a way that's kind of beautiful in

195
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:49,730
a way it's also a little I don't know

196
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,980
it's something but I think a lot of

197
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,420
people this was very new to everyone the

198
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,980
idea that you could go and you could

199
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,449
talk to someone from whatever country

200
00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:58,550
you don't know and they're from anywhere

201
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,279
they're not just your not constrained by

202
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,230
really anything except kind of your

203
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,610
terrible computer that probably could

204
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,939
not render this scene now we use viera

205
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:13,579
mel for everything right well ok we

206
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,610
don't so what would wrong like what what

207
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,709
killed vrml and i will also pause it to

208
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:22,309
you that is not dead i think i think

209
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:24,470
there's really a couple things number

210
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,939
one probably dial up when the last time

211
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:36,600
you heard heard this sweet jam yeah

212
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,189
that's beautiful um when you're going

213
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:41,990
through you're trying to render a 3d

214
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,970
world and like maybe if you've got like

215
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,429
that really good computer you've got 56k

216
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,679
like most people didn't and especially

217
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,300
when you're connecting to someone across

218
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,860
the world and the servers and who knows

219
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,139
and like you probably don't even hit

220
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:55,100
like you don't have a graphics card

221
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,870
that's not much of a thing maybe a

222
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,420
voodoo whatever but like this is a

223
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,860
problem right your computer your

224
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,559
connection like verb 3d is not a thing

225
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,079
that you can do like if you even today

226
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,029
like if you go on to some like the hot

227
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,499
new in the mo RPG or something it's

228
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:13,040
probably gonna lag like it's a thing I

229
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,019
think another problem with calm bubble

230
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,999
um remember when I said that there was

231
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,889
all like all these guys like a million

232
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:22,699
things they all bought each other so all

233
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:25,249
of these bought each other and bought

234
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,569
their developers and bought each other

235
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,129
out and then eventually computer

236
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,600
associates came in and bought the final

237
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,309
one and just said like I were done like

238
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:34,549
no more of your vrml so suddenly there

239
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:36,590
wasn't a market which is like really

240
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,800
you I mean there wasn't so it's okay but

241
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,830
i would say number 3 3d its kind of

242
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,390
that's a distracting gift at up 3d is

243
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,450
maybe not the most ideal way to do

244
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,860
things like I keep going back to this

245
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,540
idea of like you want to buy something

246
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,090
online you don't need to or like say you

247
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,200
want to go and you want to go to

248
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,380
Wikipedia you want to read about

249
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,990
platypuses or like this you're like a

250
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,810
tiger you want to read about tigers you

251
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,640
don't need to drive to the virtual

252
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,940
Wikipedia enter the library browse the

253
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,160
endless to like the matrix when like the

254
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,440
things come in like you don't that's

255
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,600
silly like you just type tiger and you

256
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,640
get it Tigers you don't have to do that

257
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,140
like you understand right so I don't

258
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,830
know but wait these were some of the

259
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,300
goals that they were talking about in

260
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,050
that ridiculous manifesto I mean spec

261
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,160
they want to perceptual eyes the

262
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,570
internet they want to kind of enable

263
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,340
people to get together and like of

264
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,320
course having cool VR experiences is

265
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,550
probably the main draw of here are all

266
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,550
right I kind of think we do all of these

267
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,270
things so maybe vrml was ahead of its

268
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,210
time select perceptual izing the

269
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,590
internet you're not so much if I was

270
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,390
like hey can you go to a website and

271
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,830
like click thing and whatever like

272
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,990
that's not that's not scary that's just

273
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,400
second nature to everybody right it

274
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,250
wasn't in 1995 it wasn't in 98 it wasn't

275
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,840
necessarily in two thousand or whatever

276
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,540
but like I feel like it's not so bad to

277
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,340
go to a website now just the idea of

278
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,030
going to a website isn't terrifying

279
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,740
that's the wrong order there's my cart

280
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,350
slide I was going to be like oh look

281
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,880
here's adding to a cart versus a real

282
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,850
cart but whatever let's talk about

283
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,770
enabling human connections and I

284
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,769
realized after this this isn't a human

285
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:41,429
i don't care i love this gift so like we

286
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,959
all know the Internet can be a terrible

287
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,670
place full of terrible people but like

288
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,040
who's made a friend on the internet like

289
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,809
an actual friend that you feel like you

290
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:50,939
know them who's made friends that are

291
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:52,019
better than like maybe some of your real

292
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,379
friends okay and i would i would even

293
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,720
pause it like I've known some of you

294
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,999
like through Twitter or through whatever

295
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,929
never met you until maybe like today

296
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,279
that's pretty powerful right and I

297
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,660
didn't need the lake I don't I don't

298
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,699
remember entering any of your vrml

299
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:11,610
Castle Haunted's or anything for us to

300
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,679
have a conversation although I wish we

301
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,709
had which and let me let me let me

302
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:18,239
digress for a second this wasn't part of

303
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:21,689
the talk but just wanted to say thanks

304
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,339
everybody for being really cool cuz like

305
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,079
I didn't really know anybody but like

306
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,699
everyone's been really inviting and I'm

307
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,379
was kind of terrified to do this whole

308
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,600
thing so thanks for being cool that's

309
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,129
that's me I'm the chicken right there so

310
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:39,059
anyway yeah that's scary i don't know

311
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:46,490
about all right yeah let's do it okay

312
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:52,290
cool huh so let's talk about cool of

313
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,470
your experiences um hey who knows about

314
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,199
the oculus rift like people are sinking

315
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,240
some serious money into that right and

316
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,389
it's like pretty cool how about did I

317
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:04,799
take out my google now I didn't it's

318
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,360
just impossible you can kind of read it

319
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,040
I didn't I shouldn't have made it the

320
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,160
same color is like cardboard google

321
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,869
cardboard is this thing where you can

322
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:15,660
basically cut out this kind of stencil

323
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,740
will make it out of cardboard or

324
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,869
whatever slap it over your phone and you

325
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:20,970
get a pretty good VR experience and

326
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,579
that's Google and that's like it's

327
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:24,899
really neat that's a thing we're doing

328
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,019
right now that's like brand new shit so

329
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,489
I think we're doing VR let's let's let's

330
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:34,060
go back to this

331
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,950
because this is really the crux of the

332
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,580
talk right here if the idea is that you

333
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,960
know you want to bring the internet and

334
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,340
make it something people can understand

335
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,910
and you want to bring multi participant

336
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,250
people in and I don't know about the

337
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,730
rendering essentially like I'm not we'll

338
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,350
leave that as an exercise to the viewer

339
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,010
I'm not going into that I think we're

340
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,290
kind of doing that like maybe vrml

341
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,230
wasn't the way to do that but

342
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,850
philosophically and this is a pretty

343
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,830
philosophical spec let's be honest I

344
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,300
really think they're on the right track

345
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,410
so let's hear it for vrml but wait

346
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,270
there's more you know how I said it

347
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,540
wasn't dead it's totally not dead

348
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,020
there's a few folks who were really like

349
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,660
and let's talk about the most unix thing

350
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:30,400
I've ever read in my life like that's a

351
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,440
stretch that's a stretch I don't know so

352
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,700
x3 dumb or X freedom as I will refer to

353
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,510
it is like this effort to get this stuff

354
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,730
into the browser so X 3d is kind of the

355
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,910
successor to vrml it's an xml-based

356
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,300
language and we all we all love XML

357
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,690
right this is kind of working in the

358
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,280
browser and like never mind that they've

359
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,320
shimmed it in with like opengl and like

360
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,880
canvas and like all this stuff they want

361
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,980
this to be a spec I don't know if that's

362
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,080
going to happen but like someone's

363
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,970
keeping up the fight and like their suit

364
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,710
like they have a fort be on github like

365
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,690
that's that means it's new and they're

366
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,790
really like Google cardboard and x3d and

367
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,030
vrml and freedom like this is a real

368
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,410
thing that people are working on right

369
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:25,780
now so never mind that this technology

370
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,110
is however old like it's a thing and I

371
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:36,410
think it's powerful because

372
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,740
so like we can inspect this and you can

373
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,660
see this amazing syntax describing cubes

374
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,140
and whatever but um yes good yeah i

375
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,520
don't know i know there's like eight

376
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,140
million ways we can do 3d in the browser

377
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,020
but this one has a spec that's pretty

378
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,240
good so I'm not saying maybe everyone go

379
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,550
out and do x3d but i will say that

380
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,370
pretty much every 3d modeling thing like

381
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,170
whether it be something fancy or like

382
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,570
Tinkercad or like whatever can probably

383
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,150
output X 3d or some of them can even

384
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,690
output vrml files directly so if nothing

385
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,400
else it lives on is an interchange

386
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,490
format I don't know that's something but

387
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,559
I guess I guess what I'm saying is I

388
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,520
know vrml sounds like I went into this

389
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,309
thinking vrml was kind of silly I came

390
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,630
out and this is someone who was really

391
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,040
thinking it was pretty cool back in the

392
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,730
day I think now it was ahead of its time

393
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,870
and maybe we're not using the VR part of

394
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,880
the vrml which is kind of well really

395
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,380
all of it but the philosophy kind of
