00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,039

welcome to jazz Fantasia maybe the first

2
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,349
conferences introduced from underwater

3
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:23,560
for me personally reject is way more

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,240
than just the conference it's it's a

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,369
very special place with very special

6
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:29,050
people and they're all gathering here

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,110
and it's it's about much more than just

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,059
technology it's really about the people

9
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:36,100
that are here and that's very very dear

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,320
to my heart so that's where Cascadia jas

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,550
came from it was heavily inspired by JS

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,500
com JS con tu l xjs node comp all of the

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,239
conference's that you think of as being

14
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:51,699
the best of what a developer conference

15
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:54,100
can be and we put on this event in

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,190
November of 2012 and it was just it was

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,199
a huge success you know we pulled

18
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,050
together just over 200 amazing people

19
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,500
for two days of fun and it was just one

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,900
of the most rewarding experiences I had

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,980
ever had

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,140
javascript what are you what even is a

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,930
class why should we care about any of

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,460
this I gave a talk about how I changed

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,670
careers in one year from no programming

26
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,399
experience at all to a hired program it

27
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,500
was rough it was hard but my talk is

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,539
about how I got so much help from so

29
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:35,100
many people in the community and how

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,830
awesome that was and trying to inspire

31
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,530
other people to help out I don't know

32
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,030
the whole atmosphere is just so friendly

33
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,310
and welcoming and all the talks have

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,340
been great and just the people seem

35
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,010
great

36
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,159
okay so here's our video stream and why

37
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,380
not when I wave thread at our robot

38
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,880
after we take off through this web app

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,670
well so the LEDs will flash and it will

40
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:30,990
drive forward one such as x-ray

semi-colons on the end of every

51
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,410
instruction there are a few conferences

52
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,150
i have in my head as my favorites in

53
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,040
europe and this is my first time at jazz

56
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,700
came here and it's just what I expected

57
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,280
and just a little bit more you topped it

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,290
I wouldn't have missed CSS columns the

59
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,930
second edition for anything HTML had

60
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:28,040
hamill and CSS hats s but jayus had just

61
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,510
yes that that

62
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,020
now CoffeeScript has brothers at ur

63
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,220
style of its own but there's just one

64
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,440
little problem when ever thrown

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,159
it's enough to make mistake with

68
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:14,170
JavaScript till source maps land or

69
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:41,030

fiddle is fuck it do it live this entire

77
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,150
thing this weary moat is bridged down to

78
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,440
an Arduino board spliced today that's

79
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,350
bridged into Johnny 5 which is running

80
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,360
nodejs that's controlling the Arduino

81
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,670
that's reading from the we thing that

82
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,570
talks out to the node copter we have

83
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,970
bound every single button to do

84
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,820
something the start button appropriately

85
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,130
starts it and because we have a windows

86
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,320
person in our group it also ends it go

87
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,630
figure the left goes left the right goes

88
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,280
right the forward goes forward the back

89
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,900
goes back just like a video gas goes up

90
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,900
why goes down B goes something and a

91
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,960
does something else we even programmed

92
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,890
in the konami code that does double

93
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,190
flips and so enjoy this is the new style

94
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,480
of gaming that we'd like to interact

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,250
native but X goes a big headache think

163
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,650

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,530
called this week it helps you to solve a

165
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,430
web app without any need to speak

166
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,650
objective-c runtime to see objective-c

167
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,320
project to see don't need that rap or

168
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,840
get in the App Store take it from me

170
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,120
sober when you do have to be shipping

171
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,750
when you are skipping objective-c Wow

172
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,450
phone cap sounds really useful thanks

173
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,230
pretty awesome you just the thing is I

174
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,060
mean you think like oh just use phonegap

175
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,290
and will solve my problems but it's

176
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,790
actually it's kind of actually not that

177
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,190
easy there are a few catches okay yeah

178
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:10,629
yeah I'll tell you about it right now

179
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:22,960
if you build both sides you can skip ie

180
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:29,639
you think es5 makes you feel alive so

225
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,310
we care about I in this

226
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,330
because we'd like challenging now we

227
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,650
want to solve problems or software

228
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,190
engineers

229
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,160
what in his a class and the Sigurd what

230
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,440
even is a class and this is a group I

231
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,050
didn't is a class and the good question

232
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,240
and like frankly the community does not

233
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,490
have a good ontology around what object

234
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,380
orientation should be no really what

235
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,110
classes are at all there's nothing that

236
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,940
works there's nothing you can read

237
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,270
there's nothing to look at I'm going to

238
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,800

those of you are not familiar is

254
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,230
pseudocode semicolons on the end of

255
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,350
every instruction I just I just wanted

256
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,080
the browser to be nice like note is nice

257
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,780
we can solve problems by removing

258
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,080
complexity by adding it so at javascript

259
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,670
burnham is your extremely used to

260
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,280
destroying data and we don't have to do

261
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,390
that

262
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,130
and we don't have to we don't have to do

263
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,070
that you don't we write to your full

264
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,530
application every five minutes and we

265
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,210
don't have to do that you don't rewrite

266
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,670
your all application every five minutes

267
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,530
and we don't have to do that these are

268
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,300
not using so did not render these are

269
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,920
not design of new things I did not

270
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,170
invent them you don't rewrite your whole

271
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,630
application every five minutes and we

272
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,010
don't have to do that what's gonna

273
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,640
happen after JavaScript and I I have to

274
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,440
believe what's gonna happen after

275
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,890
JavaScript and I I have to believe that

276
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,870
there is going to be a next language

277
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,270
because if javascript is the last

278
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:44,800
language that's just gonna be really sad

279
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,730

nice and great experience I started

298
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,360
doing web development in the mid-90s and

300
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,170

306
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,769
