2
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:12,599
that is hard to follow thank you

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,299
I'm Alex and I do a bunch of things in

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,369
this world as you can see some we're

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,520
serious some not so serious

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,320
amongst the serious things I do as I'm a

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,939
volunteer for Mozilla I'm a Muslim

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,519
representative animal attack speaker and

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,189
I want to tell you all a story about the

10
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,560
t-shirt it's basically how I got

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,100
involved in open-source about nine years

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,510
ago I was freshly out of college in

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,719
Romania and I was looking for a job now

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,300
in Romania there's only one kind of tech

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,789
job and that's outsourcing if you're

16
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,410
lucky enough to not know what

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,960
outsourcing is it basically means you

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,660
get rented out you get rented out by the

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,270
hour by the day to other companies and

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,920
when I started out I was doing this

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,340
sauce it was a trip I was working for a

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,260
trip planning company kind of like

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,630
TripIt and about three months into my

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,090
job my boss came to me and said you know

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,530
what we've got this project called

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,000
Mozilla and I need someone to fill a

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,970
role still gonna do that I don't like

28
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,799
change I really really don't like change

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,580
and on top of that I had no idea what

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,220
Mozilla was what open-source was what

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,390
the pole meant I was fresh out of

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,060
college volunteering wasn't in my

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,070
vocabulary how do you mean I work for

34
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,280
free and I enjoy it so we made the deal

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,900
with my manager he was like look I need

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,340
to fill this role for three weeks I'll

37
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,900
find someone else to replace you in

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,420
those three weeks but you have to take

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,150
it I was like okay there were several

40
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,000
problems with this the team was a tester

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,890
team I wanted to be a developer when I

42
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,549
grew up

43
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,850
testers weren't really my friends on top

44
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,570
of that then so I joined the team around

45
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,100
Firefox 4 and they had this t-shirt that

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,729
said Firefox 4 beta tester and I joined

47
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,880
a week after they got the t-shirt so I

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,069
have the t-shirt I stood out I don't

49
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,410
feel like I was welcome welcome that I

50
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,810
don't feel part of that team and I hated

51
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,740
my life

52
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,080
of course my manager was an asshole and

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,450
he didn't keep the bargain so a month

54
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,890
later I was still working for this

55
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,440
project and every morning I read this

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,420
thing called the Missoula planet which

57
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,460
is kind of like a blog aggregator and

58
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,810
everything it happens in the Missoula

59
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,630
world and I read it because it helped me

60
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,700
with my job all the road maps were there

61
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,590
the release notice says everything

62
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,590
and something kind of popped up the

63
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,780
mazhab documentation network was holding

64
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,910
a documentation sprint over the weekend

65
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,580
for 48 hours and the kicker was if you

66
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,910
participated you got the t-shirt and

67
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,620
that's when I had my great idea

68
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,590
I'm gonna go participate for like two

69
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,480
hours get the t-shirt and my master plan

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,940
it's a developer t-shirt they have

71
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,500
tested t-shirts I'm gonna get the

72
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,700
developers that t-shirts

73
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,650
not only will I fit in that team I'm

74
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,610
gonna be better than everybody else so

75
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,410
my plan also included because I was

76
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,540
fresh out of college and I had money my

77
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,120
plan also included to go get wasted with

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,880
my friends over the weekend and I joined

79
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,150
Saturday morning and then something

80
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,850
changed as soon as I joined I joined an

81
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,060
IRC and everybody was welcome everybody

82
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,400
was nice everybody tried to help me help

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,430
them and compared to my normal

84
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,680
day-to-day work that was mind blowing

85
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,170
and instead of staying two hours with

86
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:38,980
those people

87
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,800
I stayed for 48 because apparently you

88
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,210
don't need that much sleep when it's

89
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,950
fresh out of college now the sense of

90
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,260
belonging that happened over the

91
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,050
Internet on IRC was the thing that kept

92
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,770
me going

93
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,560
I felt like my job I hate my job I hated

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,360
everybody I worked with but I love this

95
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,760
people part of this project this little

96
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,190
you can call it this little tangent to

97
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,030
my work and in those 48 hours my my

98
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,620
friends kept calling me and calling me

99
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,780
where are you were at the club what are

100
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,550
you doing why don't you wanna come have

101
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,440
fun with us I was like you don't

102
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,950
understand I'm having fun with strangers

103
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,810
I met over the Internet yeah my friends

104
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,330
call me crazy another names but I stayed

105
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,370
for 48 hours I like contributed to him

106
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,139
the end I think to this day some of the

107
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,020
CSS examples I've put into mdn still

108
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,690
exist and that makes me also proud I did

109
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,530
this all for a t-shirt the t-shirt I

110
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,150
don't have the t-shirt anymore it's been

111
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,889
nine years no t-shirt lasts for nine

112
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,889
years but what I got at the end of this

113
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,220
experience as I got a sense of belonging

114
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,770
and a sense of community that I didn't

115
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,760
get anywhere else

116
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,550
going back to my work I had so many

117
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,320
ideas just because I knew the right

118
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,960
people I knew who to connect with and

119
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,880
who to talk to if I wanted to do

120
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,310
something outside of my work had this

121
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,710
network of people to help me out if I

122
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,300
had two three hours in my day and I

123
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,160
wanted to give back to something I had

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,930
this opportunity to be involved with

125
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,320
everything from teaching codes from

126
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,449
teaching kids to code the writing

127
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,570
documentation in my pajamas on a weekend

128
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,570
it was all available and I feel like I

129
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,910
finally find the missing piece in my

130
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,250
puzzle I finally found a way where I can

131
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,789
fit in now nine years later I still do

132
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:35,530
this I still contribute to the Missoula

133
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,349
community and the reason behind that is

134
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:40,630
I strongly believe in was last mission

135
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,000
if you don't know what my last mission

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,280
is please google it it's beautiful

137
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,599
and I think I'm running out of time and

138
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:48,760
I don't have anything else to say but

139
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,240
thank you

140
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,290
[Applause]
