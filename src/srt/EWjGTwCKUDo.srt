1
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,930

so chat for a second about Bespin just a

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:17,439
couple of slides but then i created this

3
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:20,300
missile labs and quickly grew a nice

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,099
community of i'm sure stuff over here

5
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:25,309
like Julianne Moore turn like a ton of

6
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,169
people there's like twenty committers at

7
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:29,719
this point I think and we wanted to

8
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,520
build this editor of our dreams that was

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,940
totally accessible from anywhere

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,010
included any device in any location we

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,870
kind of played around a little bit about

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,150
what would it be like if I'm on the

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,220
beach my boss calls me I want to fix a

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,680
bit of code and I could quickly on my

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,100
iPhone or pre login have a little weird

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,720
you do I it they're going to fix that

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,060
better code hit upon it and then keep

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,440
going on our way that was kind of like

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,420
one of the visions also going to a

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,530
friend's house and being able to get

21
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,930
your entire environment we wanted it to

22
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,670
be really simple like text may and not

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,360
be this like really bulky ide and it was

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,280
all about this performance that I talked

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,960
about this morning was like can we make

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,799
this thing scale correctly and then we

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,539
wanted collaboration to be a key feature

28
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:16,009
if you're on the web we want it to be

29
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,289
very very social and so what does that

30
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:19,909
mean what would it mean for us to

31
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,350
actually be able to write code together

32
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,990
and do fun things so we played around

33
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,060
with even bringing kind of gaming

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,219
functionality so like the team leader

35
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,959
kind of joins builds a bunch of unit

36
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,939
tests you have to go off and like score

37
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:34,100
points by implementing unit tests and

38
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,189
stuff like that and then making the

39
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,859
command line kind of integrated I just

40
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:41,630
like I loved c'mon Lions I love

41
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,670
Quicksilver Eunice Kamala's I wanted it

42
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,609
kind of baked in to the system and we

43
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:49,700
had a Mozilla ubiquity I really wanted

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,639
to kind of baked those together to add

45
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:54,380
till I just make it very easy to add

46
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,319
functionality and then to have this

47
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,779
thing fully self hosted so just like I

48
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:02,599
used to be the Emacs user who like read

49
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,350
my email through

50
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,200
emacs and all that crazy crap and i want

51
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,119
i want that when we have to sell post it

52
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,250
i'm a web guy i want the thing to be the

53
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,900
web for me to be able to trick it out

54
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,420
because you know i'm acting in this you

55
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,860
know eight hours a day so i want to be

56
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,630
able to make exactly how I wanted so you

57
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,489
know here's a little mocker some of the

58
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,950
stuff that we had you know Leon with the

59
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,890
find files aboard and doing all this

60
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,680
crazy stuff with canvas Julian actually

61
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,230
implemented the first find files that

62
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,230
was out there and then collaboration

63
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,940
being able to go through here and have

64
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,800
you know this is simulating one person

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
at it in a file versus the other one and

66
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,480
we ended up using something called mob

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,010
right which was done by a Google I and

68
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,209
it's a platform neutral solution for

69
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:55,370
doing this collaboration stuff and we've

70
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,870
also we've got people working like in

71
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,819
the eclipse foundation to build support

72
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,410
for it over there and there's even

73
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,860
someone doing a VI implementation so we

74
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,910
hope in the future you'll be able to

75
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,410
collaborate someone could be on Bespin

76
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,940
someone can be under clip someone

77
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,160
communal VI or what have you and just

78
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,170
make it so you can just share code and

79
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,760
see everything that's going on including

80
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,489
things like selection and we had like

81
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,859
autosave building right from the

82
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:21,950
beginning so in a very first prototype

83
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,010
you could like start writing some code

84
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,140
go home open it up and replay all of the

85
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,609
things that you're done so you always

86
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,109
know you're in exactly the right place

87
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,819
and that's gone and

88
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,700
we'd be coming back again and then we

89
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,560
want to want it to have a place like

90
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,150
goof around and play with new things so

91
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,370
this thing that looks like a defrag

92
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,469
would it be like if we could visualize

93
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,659
our project in different ways so see

94
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,939
who's working on one what's happening in

95
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:50,579
real time and being able to like really

96
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,959
kind of get an understanding for the

97
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,260
holistic project as a whole we had to

98
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,000
search code across the entire project

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,889
across the whole company's projects

100
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,829
across open source we just kind of felt

101
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,780
like they have been that much innovation

102
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,419
in the IDE editor space and we wanted to

103
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,709
really have somewhere to kind of play

104
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:24,380
around with this stuff yes

105
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,430
just kind of playing around to see what

106
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,290
kind of visualizations can we do to kind

107
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,440
of show what's going on in a project

108
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,780
right yep exactly and other people you

109
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,160
know picked it up right away over the

110
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,530
first weekend this guy Boris from the

111
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,020
Eclipse Foundation took Eclipse stripped

112
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,320
off its head ran it as a server and put

113
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,820
best been in front of it and so that an

114
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,190
enabled Java compilation and get errors

115
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,620
back in and stuff like that because we

116
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,180
have you know best burn is like actually

117
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,430
a whole bunch of stuff there's just the

118
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,230
editor component itself that you could

119
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,090
use for anything there's the server

120
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,490
which has an epi and then there's kind

121
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,170
of the full basement experience or

122
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,640
whatever that has the command line and

123
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,710
everything else within it and of course

124
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,140
everything's you know Mozilla fully open

125
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,660
source and we want people to start you

126
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,920
know doing fun things with it and that's

127
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,250
already happened x wiki build it in

128
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,930
right away so you can just edit using

129
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,880
bass burn you saw the Atlas guys how

130
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,940
they're a palm two days ago we just kind

131
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,340
of showed off a little bit tool called

132
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,100
areas which is a full WYSIWYG designer

133
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,310
tool for aimed you know kind of at the

134
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,930
mobile web but it could be used relief

135
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,970
or anything where you can just kind of

136
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,610
take your UI build it a long wire it

137
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,790
together using Bespin and so that should

138
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,560
be coming up pretty soon it's pretty fun

139
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,700
and then what we really want to do in

140
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,830
the future is also kind of do a lot more

141
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,169
on the server side and so what would it

142
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:56,650
be like if we had server-side plugins

143
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,720
and this is where the commonjs stuff can

144
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,970
come into that enables to do really

145
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,790
really powerful things on the server and

146
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,950
like you know be running only your

147
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,390
JavaScript code so you know exactly what

148
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,800
methods are available because we can

149
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,840
expect it at runtime and take some of

150
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,390
the small talk stuff

151
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,470
and build it in so that that's some of

152
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,480
the stuff that we kind of you know in

153
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,250
dream world really want to get to and

154
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,230
kind of play with but at this point

155
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,520
that's just kind of oh you've got your

156
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,530
thing back let's have Julian kind of

157
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,400
give you a walkthrough and his world so

158
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,110
the current state of things are we've

159
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,350
got this best friend boo-boo happening

160
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,570
we'd like to change the library that we

161
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,000
use every few months so we started off

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,370
ironically we had a new tools version a

163
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,710
prototype version the dojo version and

164
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,920
then we have sprung core going on now

165
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,160
now it's going to be in product dies

166
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,520
okay so what i will show you is the

167
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,490
actual version that you can also run on

168
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,130
Bespin doc mozilla.org and it's not yet

169
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,590
its local version here because the Wi-Fi

170
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:24,969
is not that speedy

171
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:31,979
okay good we got it okay um so this is

172
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,589
the version where we were before we

173
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:37,800
start the reboot broke progress and the

174
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,139
three board fail progress we got the

175
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,239
basic editor running you can do some

176
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:45,719
scrolling but there's no real ide so I'm

177
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:47,969
not showing you this and our aim is to

178
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,879
get to this one that is that you can see

179
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,969
here now within the end of year maybe

180
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,419
something beyond that so the first thing

181
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,909
that show you the editors editor itself

182
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,969
I mean this year's transcript file your

183
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:08,069
the cursor just can i function and got

184
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:22,250
basic highlighting yeah so

185
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,860
a world

186
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,930
basically it turns out if you want to

187
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,199
implement that on html5 it's really

188
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,820
simple because you can use cameras for

189
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,969
this it's just nothing then well okay

190
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,830
you've got to you have a syntax ladder

191
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,810
there to say okay you want function to

192
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,789
be blue and some are text screen or

193
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,039
whatever but if you have that you just

194
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,540
say well print that formed with well

195
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,790
that cherishes at that point and then

196
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,190
Meg translation in x and y for scrolling

197
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,760
that's all the hard part is to get

198
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,370
keyboard handling mouse handling copy

199
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,950
paste undoing all that stuff in there

200
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,070
just see this file here is one of the

201
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,190
basic files this here's just keyboard

202
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,460
handling and this somehow set up a

203
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,630
continues and continues and continues

204
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,950
this one cursor focus management and the

205
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,720
real pain so now we end the pain

206
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,020
function so something that's four break

207
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,380
points and that's somewhere where magic

208
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:42,610
a min so real and them feel right

209
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,850
somewhere yeah here is that formed and

210
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,770
then you read say Phil text and

211
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,150
everything else that's just for

212
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,080
adjusting colors in whatever but I mean

213
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,510
II de is something more than just text

214
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,350
editor so most time we spend on working

215
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,000
is doing other things for example in

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,190
best friend you also got the command

217
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,740
line building it's really powerful you

218
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,900
got code completion for somebody can

219
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,810
types set and chose you settings that

220
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,120
you already had so you can set font size

221
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,970
and I want this to go to eight and see

222
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,310
your font has changed there are also

223
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:26,240
some nice stuff like and well I want to

224
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,280
follow someone that's when you go to

225
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,890
collaboration and then okay you got

226
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,570
share help you got nice way to use this

227
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,720
command CD command and have back and

228
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,140
feedback from it but just command line

229
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,850
it's not man enough you also need

230
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,980
something like to access files so

231
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,140
therefore this quick album please don't

232
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,200
ask me why does this what crash at

233
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,420
around should be transparent but it's

234
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,760
not and with this um quick search you

235
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,150
can research out over your entire

236
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:12,860
project for example and let's see we go

237
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,540
something history chairs so this is the

238
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,940
history got any we can change file ribs

239
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,740
class this one here I mean what do you

240
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,410
think what language is used to implement

241
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:35,740
eight this just HTML

242
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,970
and what do you think this one here is

243
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,430
implemented of so in fact it's also

244
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,570
canvas so you got here components that's

245
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,560
one of our underground and underlying

246
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,380
canvas two kids that we use or we step

247
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,020
away from that you got this one to

248
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,610
select files but then you got a-you

249
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:07,850
powerful one or just

250
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,029
yes and while it's not a whole idea but

251
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:17,450
parts of it so this one is canvas cool

252
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,329
this one is canvas but for some this is

253
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:26,459
HTML me to bar around here Reynold with

254
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:30,600
canvas but inside its HTML and it turns

255
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,550
out you can do recreate things if it

256
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,370
comes to if you use canvas for example

257
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,760
can do slides and then if you think oh

258
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,230
well I make this a little bit more you

259
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,140
can add columns in there too sir kay it

260
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,050
doesn't fit but I make it some way fit

261
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:54,899
in there yeah it's written so this will

262
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,790
spence work I guess most pace and it's

263
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:09,899
called found ahead and wrote this is

264
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,579
pretty cool library in the swing

265
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:15,300
community

266
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,370
down

267
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:28,560
so he came over here

268
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,120
the problem is is like the level of

269
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,129
complexity

270
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,689
some of the other folks someone who

271
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:41,489
implemented the border code took the

272
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:50,860
vials CSS

273
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,380
it was just a fun experiment relatively

274
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:02,370
canvas within it could have but now with

275
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:16,660
backing away from using scrapple

276
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,010
yes

277
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,910
so here I mean you got simple file

278
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,800
access thing you can change bro checks

279
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:34,000
open files focus say okay open the HTML

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,070
file so you got this one here then

281
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,090
there's a preview button can hit it and

282
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,980
opens you to page you worked on this is

283
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,980
for example so canvas something about

284
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,170
handling how to get focused working in

285
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:53,110
canvas it's not that easy okay so this

286
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,980
is something about navigation so but

287
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,790
well I mean now you can add files you

288
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,060
have command line to run commands you

289
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,830
can open files but there's also an

290
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,660
interesting question how do you get

291
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,990
files in and out again of cloud because

292
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,600
otherwise or in normal cases you sit in

293
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,570
front of your computer every file is

294
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,700
just there you can just use it but if

295
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,140
it's in the cloud you've got to access

296
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,110
that file and best on the three ways at

297
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,020
the moment one is you can download your

298
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,290
files again which is well possible but

299
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,840
not at nice and there's a deploy

300
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,630
function which means it takes your

301
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:39,070
project and sense oh I am vtp and tune

302
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,650
server and have it there or you can use

303
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,810
CVS so at the moment we support svn and

304
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,830
mercurial and github our kit is on the

305
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,270
to-do list for a reboot progress okay

306
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,120
and then we got a great collaboration

307
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,000
feature but you won't show you that

308
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,310
already okay so it's just a little bit

309
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,280
talk about canvas and our best in

310
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,820
general and where you use canvas for and

311
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,650
you get questions about more technical

312
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,580
things so true how much to dive in there

313
00:16:18,580 --> 00:17:12,100
or

314
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,789
I

315
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:24,020
results

316
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,260
with this version there's no real

317
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,240
embedded version supported I mean this

318
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,000
one but it never get too much attention

319
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,580
and after reboot progress there should

320
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,230
be the best man that runs on the server

321
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,880
and there should be a embedded version

322
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,220
of bascom and read something like oh I

323
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,780
want to have this plugin in there and

324
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,640
this plugin this plugin builds you just

325
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,130
one chance file you've got to plug it

326
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,460
into your website and yoga so that's

327
00:17:47,460 --> 00:18:13,800
what it should end

328
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:26,570
yes

329
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:39,010
Oh

330
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,610
so the entrance under actually

331
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:50,020
I

332
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:55,560
this is

333
00:18:55,570 --> 00:20:09,049
issue

334
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,070
and should be possible after we will

335
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,220
progress process that you just provide

336
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,039
you syntax highlighter as a blog in and

337
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,580
then you just edit some how to best poem

338
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,620
then it works so it should be really

339
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:34,210
easy to extend best min data right

340
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,809
oh it's if you use collaboration you

341
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,760
first say okay I want to share this

342
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,080
project and then someone else says okay

343
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,900
I want to follow this one who share the

344
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,390
project and then you see it in your file

345
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,440
browser because I was you should just

346
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,210
shared to the person but that person

347
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,039
might not be interested in it you say

348
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,690
well I'm really interested in what this

349
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,340
person is doing you see all the shares

350
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:25,080
that he offers to you

351
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:39,340
yes there's

352
00:21:39,350 --> 00:22:08,700
so

353
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:19,520
this

354
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,560
so it's also plan to at future like time

355
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,910
machine to bespin that's something well

356
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,650
your plan not sure of it ends like this

357
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,410
that you reconsider k I stepped away

358
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,650
from pc and who did some change

359
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,540
afterwards on that file and maybe leave

360
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,510
some comments you can see me well that

361
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,880
may be okay so take though but I want to

362
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,770
get back to my stay before because just

363
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,790
grab otherwise and so it's something

364
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,240
like a VCS but its reach that saves

365
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,400
every state you can step forward and

366
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,920
backward and add comments on that that

367
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,280
would be really social together then
