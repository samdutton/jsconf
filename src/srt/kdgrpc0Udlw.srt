00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,710

thank you very much for coming inside

2
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,770
today and giving me your attention like

3
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,360
they said my name is ray Daley I'm going

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,650
to be talking about javascript

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,610
journalism the new profession and if you

6
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,710
want to follow along and examples that

7
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,800
are in the latter half of the

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,809
presentation go to jay s journalism com

9
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:40,970
I just tweeted it if someone would

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:47,570
retweet it so let's start with what is

11
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,420
news to different people news as

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,150
different things but most people

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,510
consider news this text you often hear

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,960
the people say just give me the facts

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,330
everything else is fluff all I want is

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,600
the facts we see the same thing in web

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,670
development people will say content is

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,909
king we don't need no stinking UX we

19
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,979
don't need other stuff just give me the

20
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:18,620
facts on the page in fact this attitude

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,979
about news is just text was prevalent at

22
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:24,399
the Wall Street Journal into the mid 80s

23
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:27,770
they did not publish photos regularly

24
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,350
until that time they did not consider

25
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,090
anything but text to be news the same

26
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,219
attitude affected the launch of USA

27
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:40,850
Today they'll at that point many people

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,030
considered us a day USA today is not a

29
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,060
serious news publication because of all

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,020
the color photos the flash the

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,750
interactive graphics in color but now

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,240
it's generally accepted even the Wall

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,380
Street Journal has photos on the front

34
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,610
page everyone accepts that news is

35
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,000
photos as well as text and you can go

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,430
back on more than a century to look at

37
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,500
these looking at these historic photos

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,770
to realize that photos are also news

39
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,020
even the most gifted writer could not

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,390
write a story to compete with this photo

41
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,130
entire books have been written about

42
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,670
this photo there's an emotional hook the

43
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,340
photos that you just don't get in a text

44
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,970
story we have an expression for this

45
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,270
that a picture is worth a thousand words

46
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,750
and photographs are regularly on the

47
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,660
front page of any news publication

48
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,910
whether it be printer or on the web or a

49
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:04,680
news app but news is also JavaScript

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,260
more and more on websites you see

51
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,040
JavaScript being used to help enhance

52
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,860
the storytelling in fact I will contend

53
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,260
from the day javascript was released

54
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,010
every website became a nap just the

55
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,810
people didn't take advantage of the

56
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,280
capability so how do I show you in hard

57
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,160
numbers that javascript is important to

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,880
news organizations is important to tell

59
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,190
journalistic stories so I decided to

60
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,250
look at how much text is on leading news

61
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,820
organizations websites versus how much

62
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,790
javascript is there so this is how much

63
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,820
a graph of how much text is there I know

64
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,190
you cannot read that in the back but the

65
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,769
largest site has just under 80 thousand

66
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,079
characters of text they average about

67
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,769
50,000 characters a text now you all

68
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,440
know that that jQuery is on most

69
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,320
websites so you've got jQuery how much

70
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,690
other javascript is there what do you

71
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,070
think it's 10 times 5 times 3 times how

72
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,720
much more drought how much drop more

73
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:21,250
JavaScript is there than text

74
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,080
as you can see by that chart

75
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,880
substantially more you can barely see in

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,970
blue at the very bottom of these charts

77
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,030
the amount of text and characters versus

78
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,380
the amount of JavaScript now I wrote a

79
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,600
source program it's well I made it open

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,320
source it's on github to create these

81
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,090
charts or get the numbers for these

82
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,640
charts it doesn't after actually create

83
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,150
it and these are the hard numbers that

84
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,480
produced the ratio is generally 30 times

85
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,630
more JavaScript than text I don't think

86
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,100
anyone would have expected that I

87
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,490
certainly didn't even in my job at the

88
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,170
Washington Post expected there was that

89
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,320
much more on all these sites and New

90
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
York Times it's 91 times The Wall Street

91
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,630
Journal has 1.8 million characters a

92
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:21,110
JavaScript on their site so as i said i

93
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,700
put the program that created these

94
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,200
numbers that pull these numbers from the

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,590
sites in github and github is becoming

96
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,990
the new footnote in javascript

97
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,210
journalism instead of just referencing

98
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,340
something you go to the actual code that

99
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,710
helped produce the story or helped

100
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:50,360
interpret the data that made this story

101
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,039
so you look at those numbers about how

102
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:55,810
much javascript is on these sites and

103
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,759
you start wondering does that really

104
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,770
prove that javascript is being used to

105
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,560
tell stories well just the numbers don't

106
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,240
but the numbers are important to tell

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,430
you that javascript is important

108
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,830
delivering the news so let's look at

109
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,710
some examples how javascript is being

110
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:22,379
used in news stories

111
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:25,939
the first example I'm going to I can't

112
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:29,120
actually show is the oldest example it

113
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,729
was Chicago crime this was done over 10

114
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,319
years ago where a mash-up was done doing

115
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,849
excuse me wasn't 10 over 10 years ago

116
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,949
but it was done a long time ago to prove

117
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,560
that the amount of crime in Chicago

118
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,360
varied by neighborhoods so they plotted

119
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,340
out with google maps where crime was you

120
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,879
could see the trends and that story live

121
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,189
for a long time it just wasn't a one-day

122
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:56,599
story and lived for a long time so that

123
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:04,310
was called mashup journalism a similar

124
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:12,199
one this is an app by slightly off the

125
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,080
screen let me see if we can fix that

126
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,039
there we go this is the forest fire

127
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,449
forecaster from NPR using maps to

128
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,490
present a story that could not be told

129
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,150
just in text and I could go over and

130
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,759
over different maps maps are very common

131
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:40,140
way to tell stories in JavaScript

132
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,639
another way you see is the use of

133
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,940
slideshows or sliders in news

134
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,969
organizations websites they love

135
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,889
photographs everyone accepts that

136
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,460
photography is now journalism they don't

137
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,289
all except the javascript is but they

138
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,419
accept that photography is and they have

139
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,580
lots of photos so you see sliders or

140
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,919
galleries of photos and everything just

141
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,229
like I showed you at the beginning so

142
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:07,759
maybe that's like show journalism I

143
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,270
don't know the Seattle Times use

144
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,120
JavaScript as a navigation aid to get

145
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,099
people to the right story depending on

146
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,889
the congressional district they used so

147
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,509
the story was told in a unique way

148
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:26,449
because the JavaScript lots of examples

149
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,779
of if it being used in navigation

150
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:34,680
and it's not just in the United States

151
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,940
that it's being used this is a from

152
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,240
LeMond in France and they're using here

153
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,150
a timeline and as you scroll through the

154
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,770
timeline of course it won't work right

155
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,750
now here we go you can get different

156
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,560
stories about the timeline for the

157
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,390
election and I think timelines are an

158
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,000
underutilized aspect that JavaScript

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,640
journalism another way is what some

160
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,160
people are calling Geo journalism using

161
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,670
the geolocation in devices to figure out

162
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,560
where you are and deliver you a story

163
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,250
there because of your location one I

164
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,110
worked on at the Washington Post was

165
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,470
based on if you were attending a

166
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,170
Nationals baseball game you got unique

167
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,870
stories and unique information about

168
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,209
what was going on at the park that no

169
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:44,160
one else got here's another example that

170
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,570
I think is a very interesting this is I

171
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,580
don't know if anyone's heard of this

172
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,680
study this study's been out for a little

173
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,320
while but it was just recently updated

174
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,959
these are words that are last these are

175
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,000
words that have used in many

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,060
civilizations civilizations many

177
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,490
different languages over thousands of

178
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,089
years over hundreds of years and these

179
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:10,980
are the languages and these are the

180
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,850
words and you can actually play the

181
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,980
words and you can tell a story with

182
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,170
audio that you could never do in paper

183
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,230
because you want to hear what those work

184
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,480
how closely those sound those words

185
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:35,170
sound alike in the different languages

186
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,680
now now that everybody in your packet

187
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,649
got this little box are you ready for

188
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:52,540
sensor journalism this is a story from

189
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,339
WNYC in New York called the cicada

190
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,290
tracker now if you don't know what

191
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,600
cicadas are you part may not live on the

192
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,149
east coast but cicadas are the 17 year

193
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,790
locust that return so they come out of

194
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,800
the ground when the temperature is above

195
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,310
65 degrees so they created a project on

196
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,660
here and you can go and look at this

197
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,339
project and maybe even build it tomorrow

198
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,009
measure when the temperature is over 65

199
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,880
degrees and it will get back into the

200
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,500
story incorporated in the story that

201
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,110
cicadas are likely to come out in the g

202
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,620
equal in near where you live so there

203
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,120
you have appt journalists sensor

204
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,550
journalism now I don't think JavaScript

205
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,949
journalism is limited only to newspapers

206
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,930
and news organizations I think anyone

207
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,990
can create a story that is compelling

208
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,060
journalistic story and I think this one

209
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,920
from google which is a google doodle

210
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,959
let's go I don't know how many people

211
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,240
have seen this one but this was several

212
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,329
months ago it showed it was done on the

213
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:05,850
anniversary of a Zamboni and it told you

214
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,189
about the Zamboni by interacting with it

215
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:10,319
you figured out hey it's not so easy to

216
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:13,110
drive a Zamboni as it may appear and why

217
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:21,630
the invention was such a big deal

218
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,590
let's go a little more detail here this

219
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,920
is the balance of power chart this was

220
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,400
for the last presidential election this

221
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,130
was showing the as the votes were called

222
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,110
by state the electoral votes here in the

223
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,650
United States who who was winning and

224
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,090
there was a bar in the center to

225
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,070
indicate that when you reached tipped

226
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,530
over that bar you'd won the election and

227
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,170
this is what we put up on the Washington

228
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,840
Post on the mobile site and it was all

229
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,710
done using an API and CSS so maybe this

230
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,020
is API journalism but it was all

231
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,530
JavaScript reading the JSON from the API

232
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,750
and producing this balance of power

233
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,080
chart was all CSS the other thing we had

234
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,400
to do was how do we deliver in a dynamic

235
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,870
way new charts or new maps showing which

236
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,740
states had gone to which candidate so we

237
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,910
created a no Jas program that read The

238
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,120
Associated Press API parse that figured

239
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,750
out who would one what which states and

240
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,910
it went to a series of editors who then

241
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,880
called whether a state or not and gone

242
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,220
to that candidate and to give you an

243
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,070
idea how important JavaScript

244
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,180
journalists were at the Washington Post

245
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,270
on election night they sat in the table

246
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,120
right next to all of the editors who

247
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,680
were calling which states were being

248
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,720
called they were the most important

249
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,610
people for the editors they have contact

250
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,940
with and so this created a JSON file

251
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,710
that then created an SVG file that then

252
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,920
got converted to PNG file so those are

253
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,620
what we served to the mobile users

254
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,260
instead of having to put all that burden

255
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,640
of creating those on this mobile site so

256
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,730
in javascript journalism the new way to

257
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,300
proofread is code reviews so I don't

258
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,580
expect you to necessarily read this

259
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,650
exactly but you know what a JSON

260
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,240
statement looks like and this is just

261
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,720
JSON and the top line is for the

262
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,350
presidential election and it indicates

263
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,250
either

264
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,560
an uppercase R or lowercase are just

265
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,170
typical proofreading things do we do you

266
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,390
have the case right but in this case the

267
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,550
values after the upper case of their

268
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,160
lower case had a significant difference

269
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,250
in how the news was reported about how

270
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:56,690
the election was going so when I made

271
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,600
this proposal of this talk i said i

272
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,220
would talk a little about the academics

273
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,410
behind this and this will be the only

274
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,940
slide on that i don't want to completely

275
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,920
bore you but one of the reasons

276
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,170
javascript journalism is not recognized

277
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,500
as necessarily new medium over the

278
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,540
profession it is is because the content

279
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,700
of new media is always old Mia this is

280
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,640
the media theory that Marshall McLuhan

281
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,800
was famous for creating the medium is

282
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,400
the massage or the message and the

283
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,220
content of this JavaScript journalism is

284
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,790
often text and videos and photos which

285
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,500
are people are used to seeing and

286
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,700
they're just saying oh it's just the

287
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,680
standard stuff we're used to sing and

288
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,420
not recognizing it really is a new

289
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,040
medium it's really is a new way of

290
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:52,130
telling stories okay so I think you can

291
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,980
all see that using javascript you can

292
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,800
tell probably intuitive to most of you

293
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,380
that you can tell stories that you can't

294
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,050
tell with just text or photos in the

295
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,540
standard newspaper online you can tell

296
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,760
stories that are different then you can

297
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,860
tell with the paper and as you recognize

298
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,140
this there's got to be credit to this

299
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,360
photography photographers always get

300
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,790
their credit newspaper reporters get

301
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,890
there by lines the JavaScript

302
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,089
journalists are going to start getting

303
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:28,400
their credit for this but something else

304
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,050
also happened in the last six months

305
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,790
since i made this proposal we now have

306
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,420
long form javascript journalism and

307
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,680
these are substantial stories not what

308
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,370
anybody can say are just get gadgets or

309
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,930
gimmicks or anything else

310
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,000
these are stories that certainly could

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:01,250
only be told with JavaScript so the

312
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,890
first one I want to point out to you is

313
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,480
leading up the 601 and if you go to Jess

314
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,770
journalism com you can link to this on

315
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,300
your own device and take a look at this

316
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,780
this is the story of the last 32 hours

317
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,870
of Martin Luther King's life as we know

318
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,120
the information now when he was

319
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,220
assassinated not all the information was

320
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,550
known a lot was buried in behind Freedom

321
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,770
of Information request in the FBI and

322
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,020
other places this is a very interactive

323
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,970
story done by the Memphis Tennessee

324
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,400
newspaper and they have interviews with

325
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,820
people are still live great photos from

326
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:50,360
the time a lot of information

327
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,010
this one's from the Washington Post this

328
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:58,440
is the profits of oakridge these three

329
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,250
people are peace activists activists

330
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,000
ones and none they want to demonstrate

331
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,640
that our nuclear facilities are not as

332
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,970
safe as everyone says and they pose a

333
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,300
grave danger to the United States and so

334
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,250
they broke in to oakridge spray-painted

335
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,830
messages about peace on a wall and stood

336
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,720
there and waited for the guards to come

337
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,270
and arrest them this is a very

338
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,270
substantial story fifteen different

339
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:41,350
parts to the story

340
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,560
so I don't know if you know about this

341
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,640
story this is not only in the standard

342
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,950
newspapers this is an ESPN this is the

343
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,040
long strange trip of doc Ellis so if you

344
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,740
want a very entertaining story take a

345
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,450
look at this one and you can see that

346
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,450
this story again makes use of things

347
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,420
that we see a lot in our profession

348
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:12,120
being applied to news stories now this

349
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,100
is an early one from the wall street I'm

350
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,140
seen sorry the New York Times this was

351
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,630
the bribery aisle how Walmart was

352
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,470
bribing officials in Mexico to get

353
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,180
favorable treatment to get into

354
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,250
locations it was in the news for quite a

355
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,830
bit quite a long time but this was one

356
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,210
of their first efforts of going that

357
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,220
good just on time here so I want to

358
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,980
really point out to what I think are the

359
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,750
most significant stories that I've seen

360
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,660
so far there may be other ones out there

361
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,230
this is cycling Road forward it was done

362
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,280
at the washington post a few months ago

363
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,940
it is again a long piece and tells the

364
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,100
story of a new writer in his training

365
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,770
and how he's trying to break into the

366
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,260
sport that has had so many problems and

367
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,350
I'm taking it right to stage four

368
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,270
because the cohort mine at the coworker

369
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,790
mine at the Washington Post worked on

370
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,880
this piece here that I think is one of

371
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,460
the best examples I've seen so this is

372
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,890
decoding the ride so this is taking the

373
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,280
raw data out of the cycling equipment

374
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,990
that he was writing on in Nice France

375
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,640
and showing the map in a very engaging

376
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,230
way and there's also as you can see on

377
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,510
an audio clip that you can actually hear

378
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,400
him talk so you can play that audio clip

379
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,050
and here is the actual data from those

380
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,020
devices and you can look at his heart

381
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,020
rate and see how it varies based on the

382
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,260
training is going at you can see as you

383
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,140
would expect the speed the change

384
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,140
dramatically

385
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,780
look at his cadence how consistently as

386
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,570
cadence was that's what the trainers

387
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,770
were looking for so this was the typical

388
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,080
job of a reporter go out gather

389
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,100
information turn it into a form that's

390
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,560
usable and entertaining that can be

391
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,380
presented to the public and make it

392
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,100
understandable so I think this is just a

393
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:28,010
great piece and this is wilson Andrews

394
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,060
who did the pic all the JavaScript work

395
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,060
on the piece and there's a story called

396
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,570
making cycling Road making of cycling

397
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,730
Road forward so if you want to read

398
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,340
about the details behind the coding of

399
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,720
it it's all there now let me go to the

400
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,640
what I think is the most significant

401
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,510
piece we've seen to date and that is

402
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,320
snowfall if many people seen this

403
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,780
article yet it was published last

404
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,920
December and I don't know if you can see

405
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,870
in the monitor here but the snow is

406
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,330
coming across the screen in this video

407
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,150
they've incorporated and as you scroll

408
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,290
up you can read the story and you can

409
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:19,040
see the video remembrance of one of the

410
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:27,870
people who survived this Avalanche and

411
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,500
there's where this Avalanche occurred in

412
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:37,540
these mountains

413
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,820
obviously more photos and then a video

414
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,750
here the skier coming right at you and

415
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,559
this continues on for page after page in

416
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,340
the first week I believe they had six

417
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,250
million let me get the exact number I

418
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,230
don't want to misquote it here in the

419
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,950
first weeks for six days they had 3.5

420
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:15,450
million viewers of this article a story

421
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,900
that just does not relate the same way

422
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,120
if you try to tell it in text or on

423
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,840
paper so again there's articles on the

424
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,700
making of this if you want to go read

425
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,820
about exactly how the JavaScript was

426
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,370
being used now one of the more

427
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,950
interesting things I found was this blog

428
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,080
about one of the by one of the designers

429
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,910
of the story he did this presentation

430
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,700
talking about why design manners matters

431
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,100
in telling these stories and I'm sure

432
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,320
you've all read the New York Times and

433
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,720
other stories and you can see that he

434
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,880
translated that story into the standard

435
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,410
New York Times template here and what

436
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,179
you can see on the screen it would have

437
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,240
taken 41 pages in the standard template

438
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,370
to tell that story and I don't think

439
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,070
many people of those millions of people

440
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,200
would have gotten beyond page three was

441
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,450
in the standard template you could only

442
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:25,529
tell the story by using javascript

443
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:29,090
so like I said a lot has changed in the

444
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,830
six months since I proposed this talk

445
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,130
and one thing is we're now seeing some

446
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,380
news organizations advertised for what I

447
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,660
would call a javascript journalist this

448
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,470
is a help wanted ad or from New York

449
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,470
Times for it from May seventh for in an

450
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,169
interactive story designer now they

451
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:49,460
could have called it a JavaScript

452
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,039
journalist but they use this title and

453
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,270
the bold is mine expertise with web

454
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,370
development especially using javascript

455
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,360
HTML and CSS is required and experience

456
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,850
with video audio photography and game

457
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,220
mechanics is a plus sounds like a

458
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,169
JavaScript developer to me with

459
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:18,110
journalistic experience now what any

460
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,750
journalist aims for the highest honor

461
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,690
you can get as a journalist is the

462
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,270
Pulitzer Prize that's what this is the

463
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:30,740
Pulitzer Prize and so as I said a lot

464
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,860
has changed in six months when I said

465
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,840
initially that there was no respect for

466
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,669
JavaScript journalists or not as much

467
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,350
respect for JavaScript journalists as

468
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,679
there was for photojournalist but that's

469
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:50,890
changed so in 2013 John branch who wrote

470
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,230
snowfall won the Pulitzer Prize for

471
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,200
feature writing so it was to me the

472
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,679
first JavaScript journalist art to first

473
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:03,409
drop JavaScript journalists to win a

474
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:06,260
Pulitzer Prize it says awarded John

475
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,809
branch the new york times 4 is evocative

476
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:11,390
narrative about skiers killed in an

477
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,090
avalanche and the science that explains

478
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,350
such disasters a project enhanced by

479
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,630
steph integration of multimedia elements

480
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,070
so that's quite an accomplishment we've

481
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,460
come quite a ways in this new profession

482
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,789
of JavaScript journalism in a short time

483
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,730
but I think they made a mistake in this

484
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,870
presentation

485
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,660
I think what they should have said by

486
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,559
the deft integration of JavaScript not

487
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:56,550
multimedia elements so that is my talk I

488
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,670
hope you now appreciate that there

489
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,220
really is a new profession of JavaScript

490
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,760
journalism and I hope to see other

491
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,420
JavaScript journalists attend feature

492
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,750
Jaya sconce I'm just learning I consider

493
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,900
myself to be a mediocre JavaScript

494
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,730
programmer and just a beginner in

495
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,980
becoming a journalist thank you very

496
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:34,920
much
