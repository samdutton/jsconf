1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,870

so you'll notice there's only one of me

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,400
unfortunately the Ben and Dion show I

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,080
can't make an appearance today Ben has

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,760
got I think h1n1 flu and we've been in

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,260
Europe for the past few days and he's

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,630
been like holed up in a in a hotel room

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,449
and finally it was just too crazy so he

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,939
had to fly back so I really apologize

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,940
that you get the kind of the worst half

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,969
of the deal today so if you want to get

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,450
your money back talk to those guys we

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,050
found it a Jackson we went to Mozilla

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,230
and worked on this Bespin thing that

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,440
motored she did amazing work on we had a

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,730
lot of fun doing that and we're going to

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,469
talk a little bit about kind of stuff

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,329
that we did with the best been there and

18
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,610
for the last month we've been working at

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,250
harm trying to kind of really push the

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,219
web through the mobile web space and

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,930
I'll kind of took a little bit about

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,869
that too but one quick kind of a side to

23
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,330
begin with you may have noticed recently

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,610
that Google like two days ago announced

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,760
closure that they took their tours and

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,680
finally open source am I used to work

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,740
for Google and this has taken quite a

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,200
few years and when I first got to Google

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,880
they're really good at shouting everyone

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,189
knows that but once you actually get

31
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,380
there the code bases in perforce and

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,659
it's like one massive repository which

33
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,640
is kind of strange but the side effect

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,799
is you can look at all the code so being

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,479
a JavaScript hacker i went to the gmail

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,960
source code and quickly ran away as fast

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,110
as possible after seeing it but they

38
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,409
used this closure library two of the

39
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,509
guys here of the three actually worked

40
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,090
on this eric Arvidsson who has been

41
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,070
doing this stuff for a very long time

42
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,009
and at dan poopy sr kind of the two guys

43
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,399
that started this effort off and i just

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,170
wanted to give you just a couple of

45
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,909
seconds a bit of information just to see

46
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,409
it because it's actually a series of

47
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,689
tools it's not just kind of like a

48
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,420
library that you're used to so this is

49
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,160
the library side of things and it looks

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,730
familiar too

51
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,620
dojo in the required provide kind of

52
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,710
stuff and it's a massive kitchen sink

53
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,340
just like dojo and they also did this

54
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,900
kind of thing which if you're kind of

55
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,480
from the java community way back in the

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,090
day we have this X doclet thing that did

57
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,560
this stuff until we got annotations in

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,690
the language and they've done kind of

59
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,540
the same thing where they add kind of

60
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,030
features to the world by annotated in

61
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,820
comments so if you really like right in

62
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,100
Java code for your JavaScript you've got

63
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,670
another option right here with closure

64
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:51,700
but they have these vast array of

65
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,140
libraries within the you can peek at and

66
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,910
it's really fun just to look around of

67
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,650
the code because they people have kind

68
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,360
of been finding out there's some of the

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,880
stuff that they've done it's just you

70
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,960
know it's really obviously stood the

71
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,060
test of time and the stuff like the key

72
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,940
binding support i think someone talked

73
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,770
about the internationalisation stuff

74
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,200
localization stuff is really interested

75
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,270
in it's just kind of cool to take a peek

76
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,440
in the source code not you're going to

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,480
run out and start using closure but

78
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,040
check it out now the library is one part

79
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,350
but they also have a compiler and the

80
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,180
compiler is available just through the

81
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,560
command line or you can use this web

82
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,260
service and it's really fun just to kind

83
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,520
of play around with it and put in your

84
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,590
code and do things like turn on this

85
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,590
advanced setting over here and it like

86
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,570
optimizes the hell out of things and it

87
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,820
looks at the annotations to do smart

88
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,250
things as it does that compilation so if

89
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,020
earlier on you did like this is a

90
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,820
constant it'll go through and inline

91
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,250
that code and stuff like that so there's

92
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,710
a whole suite of things that it gives

93
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,390
you and you can just put your own code

94
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,670
in here in it does a better job them the

95
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,040
yui compressor on some code sometimes it

96
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,410
breaks and doesn't even work but another

97
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,380
thing to going to check out now out wait

98
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,620
oops does anyone know who this guy is

99
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,840
this is Steve Souders who will be at the

100
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,900
show and originally I was scheduled to

101
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,000
talk after his talk so would have made a

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,230
little bit more sense by when I play a

103
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,390
little bit of a trick on him when he

104
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,919
starts his talk if everyone can just

105
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,040
start doing a little buzzed just like

106
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,450
just to going to get him there is a

107
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,310
reason why Steve is showing up this is

108
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,070
his halloween party where is a

109
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,750
pollinating his wife Carrie he's

110
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,130
performance techniques are actually

111
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,200
baked into that compiler so when you run

112
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,340
the compiler it actually does

113
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,230
performance tests on the flying gives

114
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,630
you interest in output so the stuff he's

115
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,330
talking about kind of shows up a little

116
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,880
bit here which is kind of fun there's

117
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,380
also some other really fun things that

118
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,770
he did there's Firebug extensions that

119
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,610
take care of some of the stuff that you

120
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,410
get that's messy so once you do you know

121
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,690
compilers and you get this you know

122
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,120
office cody code out then when you're

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,520
trying to debug that it's a pain or so

124
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,200
what they did they do a bunch of stuff

125
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,090
in the Firebug extension including

126
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,460
having this source mapping where you can

127
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,290
say here's my source of the original and

128
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,090
so instead of getting that there's an

129
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,710
error on line one because everything's

130
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,110
lined one it's one big line it'll map it

131
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,790
back to what's going on so it's just

132
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,470
kind of cool to see you like it's not

133
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,790
just a libraries this whole suite of

134
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,930
tools and I think there's some

135
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,790
interesting things to learn from here

136
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,740
not that you're going to obviously just

137
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,020
kind of run out and use closure anyway

138
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,680
that's the aside so I'm talking about

139
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,360
the future of the web whatever that

140
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,220
means and you know obviously kind of a

141
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,510
high-level topic we're going to talk

142
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,340
about a bunch of different things but

143
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,200
when i started with been a JAX ian at

144
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,580
the time we were given all these talks

145
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,800
on like how to build rich web

146
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,320
applications and hardly anyone was

147
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,090
showing up everyone was trying to

148
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,770
innovate on the server side and no one

149
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,690
cared about the client side and then

150
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,820
Jesse James coined the whole Ajax term

151
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,860
and then that was actually one day

152
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,770
before a server-side conference that the

153
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,450
we're out we did a search and replace on

154
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,450
our slides from d HTML to a Jackson like

155
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,810
it was a full house but it a lot of the

156
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,510
people here at this conference are kind

157
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,030
of responsible for going in getting all

158
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,890
these like hacks and quirks and little

159
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,830
ap is that the browser's had and it kind

160
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,510
of felt to me when when this stuff was

161
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,580
happening that we'd kind of like found

162
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,710
flight with Ajax we could build these

163
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,140
finally kind of rich applications on the

164
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,060
web but it was all

165
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,560
of a hack and it was all kind of pokey

166
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,389
and the runtime was really crappy but

167
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:40,130
it's amazing like we flew with would

168
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,590
like how did that happen and we kind of

169
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,389
did that the people in this room kind of

170
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:47,570
did that but it feels like now things

171
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,480
are changing and we finally get in these

172
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,360
amazing run times and new API is an

173
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,100
html5 and all of this stuff that's going

174
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,620
to enable us to get away from kind of

175
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,850
the crappy stuff that we had to deal

176
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,130
with and really kind of build some

177
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,870
disruptive applications in the future

178
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,820
and that's why I kind of at this time

179
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm like amazingly excited much more so

180
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,979
than when the Ajax revolution kind of

181
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,680
you know hit to begin with what we have

182
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,360
available and it's kind of fun to look

183
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,360
at you know what's happened when you

184
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,500
look at what's happened to browsers out

185
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,050
there from the kind of clunky Netscape

186
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,820
let's put everything in a browser and do

187
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,790
your email and everything else to fire

188
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,680
bug where we kind of streamline things

189
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,900
and then to Chrome which kind of takes

190
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,419
it trying to take it to the extreme with

191
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,060
have the browser get out of the way the

192
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,530
browser's gotten simple are on the

193
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,880
outside as far as like my mom's

194
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,530
concerned it's the same thing as just

195
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,720
like a little bit less stuff but we will

196
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,250
know that the engine is drastically

197
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,890
changed underneath we've finally got

198
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,669
something that's kind of you know up to

199
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,590
the the class that we have with the JVM

200
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,990
and the CLR and things like that which

201
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,450
you enable us to really kind of do stuff

202
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,450
with that jet plane so Ajax used to mean

203
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,610
this when we did our first like Ajax

204
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,430
experience it was kind of a grassroots

205
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,930
thing just like this conference I think

206
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,639
these conferences like by far the most

207
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,430
exciting and all the talks are all about

208
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,100
like little things on top of this Ajax

209
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,010
thing and quickly we saw our whole slew

210
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,139
of libraries come out to like really

211
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,090
make it easy to do that kind of stuff

212
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,919
and give us a facts and interesting

213
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,190
things and then we kind of drew the

214
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,500
universe and now like once a week I get

215
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,280
a new email for like a new Ajax library

216
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,839
we've kind of nailed the remoting thing

217
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,630
at this point I think but as we look to

218
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,969
the horizon we're really seeing kind of

219
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,409
going way beyond have

220
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,759
this one little oh oops and think it's

221
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,440
been way too much time on on these

222
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,050
slides I apologize for that it's just

223
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,120
keynote and so fun yeah it's so easy and

224
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,050
when Ben and I kind of looked at the

225
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,490
horizon with like talking about all this

226
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,009
great html5 stuff and we're like well we

227
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,290
need to like really build something on

228
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,389
top of this and and see what we can what

229
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,269
we can really do and that's why Bespin

230
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:09,860
actually came about we wanted to going

231
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,689
to play around with all of the new

232
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:14,360
technology and we're geeks obviously so

233
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,069
you thought what's an application that

234
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,839
you wouldn't really think of to do on

235
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,660
the web and make it happen and so for us

236
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,000
it's a code editor that's what we live

237
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,259
in all the time if we could make

238
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,360
something that's kind of desktop class

239
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,850
desktop quality then that will say a lot

240
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,430
and so we we went about trying to do

241
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,279
this and we tried it actually a few

242
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,610
times and the platform wasn't ready the

243
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,959
first couple of times that we tried it

244
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,759
was just really clunky and really kind

245
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,889
of annoying and I didn't work for us but

246
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,860
it's only recently that we finally got

247
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,620
it to work and so if you haven't seen

248
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,569
this is Bespin web-based code editor and

249
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,759
this is all you know canvas doing the

250
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,759
rendering and we were able to like

251
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,189
really focus on the performance side

252
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:00,259
that's all we really focused on at first

253
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,389
was to be able to scale up because we

254
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,490
saw a bunch of different editors that

255
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,839
are out there on the web and we've all

256
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,550
been there little kind of web-based text

257
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,339
areas and once you get past you know a

258
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,019
few thousand lines it all just kind of

259
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,759
breaks down you got a million Dom nodes

260
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,339
and it's it's craziness and it was only

261
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:18,410
when we got to using canvas that we were

262
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,139
able to scale this thing up and we in

263
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:23,000
our prime we had this one session where

264
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,089
we had 50 thousand lines of code at 83

265
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,910
people simultaneously edited on it and

266
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,829
it hold up and that's what we were

267
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,230
really trying to do was be able to kind

268
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,579
of like prove that the web can do this

269
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:36,019
kind of stuff and best buds got a long

270
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,110
way to go but that's kind of the key

271
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,670
thing that was like okay I think that I

272
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,709
think that we're kind of there and it's

273
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,009
really exciting so the technology that

274
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:48,170
we use not to invest member that we're

275
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,209
particularly excited about with the web

276
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,579
right now is the graphic side obviously

277
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:53,810
with things like canvas

278
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,029
finally having a decent JavaScript

279
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,310
engine and a whole slew of them that

280
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,600
we're seeing going on right now in the

281
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,510
industry web workers and the notion to

282
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,220
finally be able to do background tasks

283
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,300
that don't just going to freeze the

284
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,420
browser and then also kind of breaking

285
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,580
through this Web sandbox and being able

286
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,800
to like access the underlying core

287
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,560
services on whatever device or laptop

288
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,170
you're on is all so exciting and then go

289
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,910
and beyond that to the world of mobile

290
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,710
which we're obviously excited about with

291
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:27,050
a new position okay so we're able to do

292
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,540
stuff like gmail with primitives like

293
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,980
text little divs and images and that's

294
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,490
it and like you know how many posts have

295
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,200
I put up on a Jackson about how to best

296
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,270
do a rounded corner like it's crazy

297
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,930
right that we have to work in this world

298
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,339
where everything is a hack to do any

299
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,680
kind of thing that you want to do on a

300
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,630
UI world and again it's amazing that

301
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,650
we're able to do these great

302
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,620
applications with these primitives but

303
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,260
now we can go beyond that and we can do

304
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,130
cool things like this using canvas and

305
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,600
it's you know natively working with the

306
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,450
browser so this guy in here is just like

307
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,730
images that we can do things with and

308
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,130
rotate and do interesting experiences we

309
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,980
can do real-time physics within our

310
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,480
application and then of course we can

311
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,420
have gratuitous games and finally we can

312
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,480
do whatever we need in our particular

313
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,040
experience so we can have a really

314
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,290
immersive experience kind of for the

315
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,810
first time and when you take that

316
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,180
further and you marry it with other

317
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,089
things that we get in like video this is

318
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:34,130
an example from the Mozilla guys in

319
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,070
France where a video is playing they're

320
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,350
capturing the frames there do an

321
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,750
analysis to find the the white lights

322
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,430
that are coming out of their iPhones and

323
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,220
then they're real time putting in

324
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,930
different elements which can be videos

325
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,970
their own canvas little games and things

326
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,640
on the fly this is kind of like holy

327
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,110
crap like the web can actually do this

328
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,510
stuff now in real time like this is

329
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,040
pretty amazing like we haven't really

330
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,740
kind of taken use of a lot of the stuff

331
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,959
and again because canvas is native to

332
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:03,710
the web

333
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,930
it allows us to really tie into all of

334
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,730
the other technology that we have

335
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,350
available which which i think is

336
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,920
incredibly excited so we've been able to

337
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,930
do this with flash and now Silverlight

338
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,000
so you know what's the big deal well

339
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,330
there's a few things that make canvas a

340
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,330
little bit different startup did that

341
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,400
delay is one of those things like with

342
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,600
best one we really didn't want to have

343
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,570
the kind of loading situation where you

344
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,860
have to wait there for a little bit and

345
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,240
we're able to do that because

346
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,710
everything's already booted up it's just

347
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,260
using the browser pipeline then there's

348
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,540
also the ability that you can use this

349
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,550
on mobile devices right now a whole

350
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,800
bunch of them support canvas so you can

351
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,330
start doing these kind of rich things on

352
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,050
mobile devices you have rendering

353
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,930
fidelity with the browser and if Ben

354
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,490
were here he's like particularly I you

355
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,050
know about this stuff he can like look

356
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,240
at any fun and know everything about the

357
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,130
aliasing and what's going on and all

358
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,110
that kind of stuff and so it like really

359
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,630
bugs him when he's working with a flash

360
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,490
application or something that just

361
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,440
doesn't look quite right and we probably

362
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,960
all kind of felt that in different areas

363
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,000
with flash and because canvas is just

364
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,530
using the browser to do the rendering it

365
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,990
really just kind of fits in and the text

366
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,550
looks Ryan and everything just kind of

367
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,640
fits in nicely and there's no bridges so

368
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,200
if you want to talk through you know

369
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,070
there's a lot of things that we've done

370
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,630
where we kind of bridge over to flash

371
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,820
and then get things back and that's

372
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,140
great but we don't need that because

373
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,850
we're just using the JavaScript engine

374
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,790
itself to power the graphics ability and

375
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,650
and it's not a plug-in so we don't have

376
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,120
the separate life cycle and the secre

377
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,890
separate beast that we have to worry

378
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,920
about it's just built in so fact canvas

379
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,200
is gray it's just a way to have this

380
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,240
kind of immediate mode API to draw

381
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,140
things to the page but then we get these

382
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,930
guys who come along that kind of rant at

383
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,910
us at about like oh this canvas element

384
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,070
it's like I go into my Firebug explorer

385
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,570
and it's just canvas and I can't see

386
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,120
what's in there this just isn't the web

387
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,710
it should be all damn it should be

388
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,720
really easy for me to go in and kind of

389
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,930
peek at it and for that we have you know

390
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,150
SVG which does have its own Dom when all

391
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,900
these things and you know has been

392
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,880
problems with SVG it kind of came out of

393
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,220
that

394
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,939
XML world an XHTML and there's been a

395
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:23,189
lot of issues with what that means just

396
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,480
kind of getting it working with with

397
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,879
HTML but we're finally getting past that

398
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,720
and Brad Neuberg of google has recently

399
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,389
released this thing SVG web which allows

400
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,779
it to also run on ie using flash as a

401
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,189
bridge to actually rendering what's

402
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:39,959
going on so if you're one of those kind

403
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,089
of purist that likes having a world

404
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:44,009
where you have a DOM and there's things

405
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,449
that are a lot nicer about it you don't

406
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:46,740
have to roll your own eventing and

407
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,230
things like that then SVG is definitely

408
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,689
becoming more of an option we're

409
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:56,540
obviously more canvas guys getting fonts

410
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,550
you know Jonathan Snoke gave a talk

411
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,990
frontiers and amsterdam all about fonts

412
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,269
and the power of typography and what we

413
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,699
can do and finally on the web we can

414
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,920
actually do really rich fonts and really

415
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,170
kind of take the experience into our own

416
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,689
hands and it's kind of ugly right now

417
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,189
there's all these different warring

418
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:19,589
formats and stuff going on that we used

419
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:22,259
to in kind of dealing with browsers but

420
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,089
it's really exciting that we can play

421
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:26,279
around with this stuff and there are

422
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,170
sites out there and tools like type get

423
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,509
that are really kind of helping us get

424
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,339
over the cross browser nonsense where we

425
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,439
can just slap in a bit of JavaScript and

426
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:36,509
get the fun that we want to deliver the

427
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:38,550
experience we want without having to use

428
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,740
like a flash wrapper or something to

429
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,930
give us that particular phone using

430
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,379
Sephirah or coupon or what have you okay

431
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,000
so we've got these like amazing graphics

432
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
abilities new fonts really cool stuff

433
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,930
but none of this would really be

434
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,990
possible with the engines themselves

435
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,180
hadn't radically changed like we've been

436
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,250
living with these you know crappy VMs

437
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,990
for a long time little interpreters

438
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,329
running our code and in that gmail

439
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:06,510
codebase that I ran away screaming from

440
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,520
like fifty percent of the code was

441
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,020
trying to get it to port perform well in

442
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,980
certain browsers and it's just not the

443
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,809
fun stuff that we as web developers want

444
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:16,919
to be working on we want to be adding

445
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,020
cool features and delivering great user

446
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,429
experiences but you know at the same

447
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:26,159
time roughly Brendan Eich of Mozilla

448
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,039
when and kind of found his academic

449
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,659
peers mainly

450
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:32,849
on the East Coast and took the

451
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:37,019
actionscript vm from Adobe and built

452
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:39,720
trace monkey this trace Bates ginning

453
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,570
platform that allows you to really on

454
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,369
the real time observe the code and

455
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:46,799
compile paths that you're using

456
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,440
repeatedly into native code and we get

457
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,119
amazing performance improvements from

458
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,369
that and then Google went and grabbed

459
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:58,049
Lars from from Denmark and had him kind

460
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,979
of come out and he built the small talk

461
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:04,409
vm he built the hot spot in Java and

462
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:07,830
he's kind of done it again in the

463
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,379
JavaScript world and what's excited

464
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:12,119
about this is it's not just like twice

465
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,489
as fast and so it's exponentially faster

466
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:17,759
and stephen levi who writes for wired

467
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,440
and other things when he first started

468
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,749
playing around with chrome and seeing

469
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:24,090
this v8 stuff he just suddenly kind of

470
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,599
you know realized when something gets

471
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,539
redone exponentially faster it's not

472
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,489
just different it enables new things to

473
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:34,739
happen and we're seeing that I think

474
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,149
with with being able to have this core

475
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,580
engine and they've only just begun right

476
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,200
like there's tons of stuff that they're

477
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,479
doing and this is just kind of the

478
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,099
waters rising for all of us to like

479
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,299
really be able to do the things that we

480
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,450
want to be doing one little thing that

481
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,450
that's kind of interest in under the

482
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,549
scenes is the the whole world of memory

483
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,099
management javascript is traditionally

484
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,379
just been mark and sweep and so you see

485
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:00,119
this in your application law if you're

486
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,950
like running little JavaScript game and

487
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,749
things just kind of pause now and then

488
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:06,239
right it's pausing because it's doing GC

489
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,940
and it has to go through the entire

490
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,769
memory set to go through and kind of

491
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:12,989
deallocate what's going on in the memory

492
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:16,440
well v8 finally introduced generational

493
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,049
garbage collection which you know other

494
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:20,429
platforms like Java have had in a long

495
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:23,190
time where you have kind of the young

496
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,889
generation here of new objects which we

497
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:27,179
found you know eighty percent of the

498
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,159
objects that we create things like in a

499
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:30,960
for loop that we can reclaim quickly and

500
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,729
there's only a few objects that kind of

501
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:34,649
live around later and so instead of

502
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:35,849
having to go through the entire memory

503
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,639
space we can go along clean up what's

504
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:40,739
going on in the new space and then come

505
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:42,930
along later

506
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,400
move things that have kind of been

507
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
hanging around for awhile and so this

508
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,390
will finally help us get rid of these

509
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,120
pauses that we see in our applications

510
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,280
when we build them on the web runtime so

511
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,410
we're really excited about that too then

512
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,370
there's new things that are out there

513
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,740
like VA has this notion of snapshots and

514
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,420
just like really really wicked cool

515
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,800
stuff that's going on on the low level

516
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,480
that again it's just kind of a general

517
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,070
enabler but then we have this question

518
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,600
and it's easy to kind of make fun of

519
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,890
these guys and it's kind of fun too but

520
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,890
the good news is that recently tons of

521
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,270
different Microsoft people have kind of

522
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,650
been coming up to us sometimes like oh

523
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,330
don't tell anyone this but you can

524
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,740
imagine we're working on this really

525
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,800
cool new JavaScript vm and we see them

526
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,180
kind of coming out and helping with the

527
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,910
canvas spec we're so far helping means

528
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,770
taking it out of html5 but hopefully

529
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,290
they're actually going to implement

530
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,850
canvas and things like that and we

531
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,230
actually think they're going to do this

532
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,420
this time so hopefully an IE 9 will

533
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,190
start to get this stuff so 15 years from

534
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,160
now we'll be able to actually use these

535
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,360
technologies so we've got this really

536
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
fast JavaScript which is great but

537
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,410
there's always going to be something

538
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,150
that you do computationally that's going

539
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,100
to take longer than point one second and

540
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,020
therefore our users going to notice it

541
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,970
so here's pics tastic which is like a

542
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,460
little kind of photoshop thing and what

543
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,530
we're going to do is desaturate this

544
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,620
image over here and notice it's kind of

545
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,540
freezing the entire browser and it's

546
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,130
going to go long enough because it takes

547
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,540
five seconds to give us the script

548
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,660
warning and it doesn't matter how fast

549
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,040
the javascript is there's always going

550
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,130
to be things that take this long and so

551
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,990
you know this is obviously a horrendous

552
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,270
experience for our users and we need to

553
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,790
get beyond that so what we'd normally do

554
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,920
in kind of the desktop world is we'd

555
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,840
have a background thread that actually

556
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,570
does the desaturation but we don't have

557
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,060
threads in JavaScript and we're not

558
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,160
going to get them because Brendan Eich

559
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,440
you know did this whole big post about

560
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,660
our you know thread sock and we have

561
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,980
people like Doug Crockford who don't

562
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,500
want any innovation to happen at all I'm

563
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,410
just just it's just kidding so we're not

564
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,030
going to get new features no we're not

565
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,490
going to get threads but we actually

566
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,679
something that you know arguably is is

567
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,410
better with workers because with workers

568
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,000
you don't have all of the issues that

569
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,679
you have with threads with shared stayed

570
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,260
and just all of the pain that we have to

571
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,570
do when we work with threads and I've

572
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,000
worked with you know genius software

573
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,190
programmers that still always get the

574
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,480
threading stuff wrong and it's just like

575
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,030
incredibly painful to actually get this

576
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,490
stuff right and so I'm excited that

577
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,510
we've actually taken a different

578
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,809
approach to get stuff working with with

579
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,140
web workers to enable us to do this so

580
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,970
here's you know a little example of what

581
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,980
happens when you start using web workers

582
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,350
when this guy spins the Firefox icon

583
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,640
that means that the browser is

584
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,380
responsive and we're going to do a

585
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,410
little annealing calculation at ups the

586
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,450
browser is already frozen and it's going

587
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,790
to calculate the fastest path between

588
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,920
all these points and at this point like

589
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,570
the entire browser is just frozen for

590
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,429
the user and we have to wait for a few

591
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:51,260
seconds for it to be done and then the

592
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,970
browser comes back again that's

593
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,610
obviously not very good when you do it

594
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,210
with with workers though that's not the

595
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,740
case because it's going to do all of

596
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,330
that calculations in this background

597
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,280
process so it's going to send a message

598
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,290
over to a worker that's running

599
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,030
somewhere else is going to do the

600
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,410
calculation then it's going to speak

601
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,630
back to the main browser thread and it's

602
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,290
going to say okay here you go so now

603
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,120
with workers we can like all of our

604
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,500
mouse overs are still working

605
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,780
everything's totally responsive and then

606
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,610
we get the results so we have the

607
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,280
JavaScript execution speed and now we

608
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,350
have the beginnings of the ability to

609
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,929
actually do and you know things off of

610
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:31,730
the main UI thread which are enable us

611
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,880
to deliver these great experiences and

612
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,640
we used this stuff actually motor did

613
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,010
the work for this to have things like

614
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,160
the syntax engine investment run off of

615
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,720
the main UI thread because you don't

616
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,550
want to like freeze someone typing as

617
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,260
you're doing the syntax calculations and

618
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,540
if you're doing code completion you

619
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,220
don't want to like hit period and then

620
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,750
start to type in the browser freezes

621
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,030
while it works out the completions you

622
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,400
want to push that off into a background

623
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,630
worker where this actually came from is

624
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,710
related to the database stuff that we

625
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,290
have on the web when the gmail guys were

626
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,070
trying to do gmail offline

627
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,830
kind of through the guise of gears the

628
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,540
problem we had was whenever we're doing

629
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,190
anything with the database from gmail

630
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,740
the browser would freeze because that UI

631
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,110
thread of the browser was locked talking

632
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,300
to the database and so at first they

633
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,890
could just kind of like do a little hack

634
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,810
and make all the database access work on

635
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,480
a different process a different thread

636
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,190
but that didn't scale to other problems

637
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,020
and that's where kind of web workers

638
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,760
were born as this worker poor API or

639
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,740
it's like let's give developers the

640
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,100
ability to do that somewhere else we

641
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,620
have you know this offline storage now

642
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,570
which you need for the client-side

643
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,390
applications and once again though we're

644
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,980
in this kind of well weird little fight

645
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,290
where a bunch of the browser supports

646
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,830
equal but other people like Mozilla

647
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,840
really don't believe sequels the right

648
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,630
answer for local storage on the web it

649
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,250
doesn't feel webby enough for them they

650
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,270
prefer kind of the couchdb kind of model

651
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,910
but beyond that kind of you know kind of

652
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,250
almost religious debate there's also the

653
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,050
issue of what does it mean to say that

654
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,500
its sequel ian Hickson when you know it

655
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,030
kind of seemed like the sequel stuff was

656
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,260
going on was literally going to go

657
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,420
through sequel liar and standardize

658
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,060
that's dialect of sequel and so we're

659
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,950
basically binding everyone to use sequel

660
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,390
line but I II can't use sequel light and

661
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:30,380
you know opera can't use sequel light so

662
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,330
it's really a bit of a predicament so

663
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,610
hopefully we'll see some other things

664
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:41,390
kind of take off there now the GPU

665
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,620
hasn't been really available to us

666
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,850
through the web platform before

667
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,670
everything's being kind of software and

668
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,050
but we're seeing us being able to kind

669
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,660
of wire into the GPU in interesting ways

670
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,780
and again this is another kind of

671
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,980
technology that we need to be able to

672
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,690
enable really interest in applications

673
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,760
one way of doing this we're seeing is

674
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,580
with WebGL where we can just take kind

675
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,820
of the opengl world and now in firefox

676
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,660
and in WebKit nightlies ending in chrome

677
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,610
nightlies to you can actually start

678
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,660
having these really rich experiences

679
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,610
which is fantastic to see and we have

680
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,559
the o3d stuff from google

681
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,480
is kind of another take which is a kind

682
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,179
of higher level API and we can do

683
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,240
amazing things like this it's fantastic

684
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,269
look at that experience but teapots even

685
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:35,220
but the problem is that web hackers you

686
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,049
know a lot of them don't think in this

687
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,870
OpenGL kind of world so it's it's kind

688
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,249
of tough to say like here's how you

689
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:43,289
could a really rich experience go learn

690
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:46,679
OpenGL kind of a dialect is not really

691
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,649
what we want to do luckily apples really

692
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,480
stepped up here and there deliver in

693
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,869
these GPU accelerated 3d things just

694
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:57,600
through CSS and so you get a lot of

695
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,830
benefits out of this you get this

696
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,909
rotating cube here but you can then do

697
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:04,529
text selection and it all just kind of

698
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:07,200
works it's all like built into what's

699
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,999
going on and it's all hardware

700
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:10,529
accelerated for you and you don't have

701
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,779
to think about it it's just declarative

702
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,269
and if you take something a little bit

703
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,369
more fancy this is just a hole like

704
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,980
sedatives and you can do immersive

705
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,230
experiences like this without having to

706
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,240
do much at all this is just all CSS

707
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,240
transforms and it appears Lakhia on the

708
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,769
screen here than it actually is because

709
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:31,080
of the video that we're taking if you

710
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,519
actually kind of play with it you know

711
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,169
it feels like it feels like you're

712
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:35,610
really kind of immersed in this

713
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,249
experience and it's pretty trivial to be

714
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:40,559
able to deliver this stuff now so we've

715
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,080
got amazing rich things coming the

716
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,639
Mozilla team is working on CSS

717
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:46,350
transforms I'm sure other people are too

718
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,570
and it's really excited to see how we

719
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,879
can just declaratively do amazing things

720
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,639
like this and also push it through with

721
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:56,850
with javascript to so we're able to do

722
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,269
amazing graphic stuff we've got

723
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:02,279
applications like this really rich

724
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,350
applications but as soon as you start

725
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,669
working in this world you want to kind

726
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:07,830
of break through from these applications

727
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,480
so you're working with your email app

728
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,340
you really like to be able to tie into

729
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,350
your address book or something for

730
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,929
example and we're not able to do that

731
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:17,730
traditionally through the web because

732
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,259
the web gives us this kind of sandbox

733
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:21,629
world which makes sense on the security

734
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:23,549
side but it doesn't help on the

735
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,129
functionality side luckily we've got

736
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:28,799
some kind of technologies that can help

737
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,710
us do some of this stuff fluid in prism

738
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,070
two technologies that

739
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,470
allow us to kind of take our apps and

740
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,630
kind of bless them and have them run and

741
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,519
kind of like their own shell and you

742
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,990
have to do things prism is you know

743
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,480
cross-platform fluid is Mac only and you

744
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,100
can then kind of put user scripts in

745
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,259
there so in the gmail world I can plug

746
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,269
in a user script that says now when I

747
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,590
get an email to a little growl

748
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,960
notification for me and like really

749
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,940
customized stuff that is really quite

750
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,950
cool but it's the kind of stuff that we

751
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,299
would use but it's not the kind of stuff

752
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,269
like my mom's going to use and then

753
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:03,549
another approach is air and titanium

754
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:05,049
which enable you to just take your web

755
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,909
skills and build desktop applications

756
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:09,789
and that's interesting too but what I'm

757
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,649
like more excited about beyond this

758
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,029
stuff is we're actually seen the

759
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:14,289
browsers kind of take on this challenge

760
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:16,809
so Mozilla's been spending a lot of time

761
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:18,940
thinking about what it means to have a

762
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,309
really rich trust model using something

763
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:23,259
like Jack pack to kind of give you the

764
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:25,419
extensibility and then kind of layering

765
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:28,029
on you know technical security on top of

766
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:30,190
that and then social trust networks on

767
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,190
top of that even so my mom can see odeon

768
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,620
uses this little plugin so I'll trust

769
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,049
him and i'll use it to and give me

770
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:40,779
enhanced abilities chrome has the notion

771
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,250
that is playing with called app tabs

772
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,850
which allows you to take your gmail tab

773
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,529
and kind of bless it and say I want

774
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:49,929
gmail to do more things and it just kind

775
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:51,629
of pins it in and allows you to do

776
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:54,009
richer things for those particular users

777
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,779
so I'm excited to see his kind of

778
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:58,000
breakthrough that sandbox and that's one

779
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,259
of the reasons that Ben and I joined

780
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:01,149
palm is that that's exactly what they

781
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:03,429
did when we saw webOS kind of showing

782
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:05,889
off at CES last year when they got up

783
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:08,230
and said like the phone is just like the

784
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,779
platform is the web it made a lot of

785
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:13,509
sense to us and a lot of people come up

786
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,279
to us and we just had an event in London

787
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,870
kind of talking about mobile web stuff

788
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,639
and they're like yeah it's great that

789
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:19,990
you can like build your app using the

790
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,940
web but surely your native apps like

791
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,789
your mail app calendar SMS that's not

792
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,009
built on the web right use native stuff

793
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:28,929
in that and it's not at all the whole

794
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:32,200
proof point of the webos stuff was all

795
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,690
of the apps in there are just web apps

796
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,639
and in fact we make the source code

797
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:38,259
available to you guys so you can even

798
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:40,029
take a look at the mail app and see what

799
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:41,710
it's like what's it like touchy write an

800
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,950
application like that and then they had

801
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,440
to put in a bunch of device a

802
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,409
is that we have to use to get access to

803
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:51,539
the native world and so this is kind of

804
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,309
one thing on the mobile side where it's

805
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,600
going to pushing through and break-in

806
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,370
through the sandbox to give us really

807
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,149
rick trunks out functionality does

808
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:07,049
anyone know this guy is not a me it's

809
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:09,929
dave thomas not the Wendy's guy in the

810
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:13,019
US but a guy writes some Ruby code he

811
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:16,049
always says on panels I like my name is

812
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,820
Tia now mayor and I manage at Ajax guy

813
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,919
he's as my name is dave thomas i'm a

814
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,840
program and that's what ever says but he

815
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,559
runs the pragmatic book series and ben

816
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,320
and i wrote a no fluff just stuff

817
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,769
symposium tour and someone asked this

818
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:33,750
panel that we're on you know what's the

819
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,149
future of software and this is the time

820
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:38,309
where flex had just come out Adobe AIR

821
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:40,320
was just being kind of banded around

822
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,470
called Apollo and the WPF staff from

823
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,649
Microsoft and so Ben got up and gave

824
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:48,539
this like rousing speech about rich

825
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,789
internet applications and immersive

826
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:52,620
experiences and all these great graphics

827
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,320
and then they've got up and he just took

828
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,730
his phone that he had at the time and

829
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,620
put it in the air and said this is the

830
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,259
future of software and Ben started to

831
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:02,610
argue with him about like look at this

832
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,399
crappy screen is like a green screen

833
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:06,840
like how is this the future we've got

834
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,610
these amazing graphics abilities on the

835
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,679
desktop like this is in the future of

836
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,529
software but we're finding that you know

837
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:16,200
they're both kind of right and the

838
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,480
mobile experiences stuff is really taken

839
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,240
off and it makes sense we've gone from

840
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,549
the world of you know the PDA to the

841
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:25,679
smartphone and finally with the iphone

842
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,120
we realize that we've actually just got

843
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,250
computers in our pockets that also

844
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,259
happen to be able to make phone calls

845
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,549
sometimes badly but it's like finally I

846
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:36,720
have the hitchhiker's guide to the

847
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,580
galaxy I've got a three year old boy

848
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,649
that asked me questions and I can kind

849
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:43,830
of get on the web and ping Wikipedia and

850
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,230
tell them what it is like it's amazing

851
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,779
what we have available and it's just

852
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,120
really exciting because now we've got

853
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,590
things you know that are really small

854
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,179
that we have this whole world of devices

855
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,879
out there and we're only limited to our

856
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:58,140
imagination on the forum

857
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,540
act like we're going to see watches that

858
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,430
are these devices are we're going to see

859
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,990
my classes will be able to do this stuff

860
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,500
like it's it's not far out there and I

861
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,940
get really excited about it but then I

862
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,620
also get really worried when I look at

863
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,020
all of these boxes and I see that every

864
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,250
one of these is like a different

865
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,850
proprietary API that I have to learn and

866
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,990
sometimes it's like this weird sea

867
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:25,250
dialect just after the disaster further

868
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,170
but you know what would the world be

869
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,110
like if if we could unify that and it

870
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,090
was kind of fun to think about like most

871
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,430
of these devices have this little guy in

872
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,380
it with WebKit that just kind of snuck

873
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,740
out of K HTML and in Safari that has you

874
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,720
know a pretty small share but a decent

875
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,970
share but now it's like everywhere in

876
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,730
mobile devices like it's amazing the web

877
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,930
is already there you can do great

878
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,330
experiences on the web across these

879
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,190
different things and then we obviously

880
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,810
upon kind of tried to take that to the

881
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,850
next level to make it the way to to

882
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,520
build native apps and so the reason that

883
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,200
we really went to Palm was to see if we

884
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,180
can make the web the unifying platform

885
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,520
for all of these things can we get to a

886
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,740
world where we take web technology and

887
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,570
we can deploy it to a whole slew of

888
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,090
devices that are coming out there like

889
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,040
right now we think of the mobile web as

890
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,890
being you know 320 by whatever on an

891
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,630
iphone screen but that whole world is

892
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,060
changing right it's I know that I'm

893
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,710
going to sit in my car my phone's going

894
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,510
to talk to the little nav screen and

895
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,240
display my email like I can't wait for

896
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,470
this stuff is really exciting about how

897
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,919
do we deliver these applications and so

898
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,380
we think that the web is going to be

899
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,580
able to deliver that and that's not just

900
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,640
about Palm webOS it's about a whole slew

901
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,140
of other really exciting technologies

902
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,820
you know Brian's here going to be

903
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,860
talking about phonegap being able to

904
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,480
take your web skills and deploy it

905
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,850
across a whole slew of devices that are

906
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,669
out there and titanium mobile has got a

907
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:53,250
set of tools a different de phonegap but

908
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,380
are interested in their own route and so

909
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,909
I'm excited at palms are going to work

910
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,190
together with the whole web community to

911
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,900
build the web platform as the way to

912
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,630
deliver these experiences we don't want

913
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,490
to have like a palm specific proprietary

914
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,620
API we want it to just be the web

915
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,670
okay a little segue these conferences we

916
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,750
get excited about the engine I get

917
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,950
excited about all the new cool

918
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,930
JavaScript API is and what's coming with

919
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,570
html5 and finally we have api is that

920
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,730
are aimed at building web apps and not

921
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,590
web documents and websites but it's not

922
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,420
really the engine that that matters and

923
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,980
I have to keep remembering it it's

924
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,200
actually the experience that really

925
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,750
matters and we kind of see this in a car

926
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,780
i remember when Ben and I first saw this

927
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,300
ad I don't think Benny ever knew what an

928
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,160
Aston Martin was before he saw this

929
00:35:49,170 --> 00:36:41,080
that's just watch this resented

930
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,590
so I'm not even a car guy which is

931
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,930
heresy in Germany I know but like I want

932
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,970
to buy that car now or like that looks

933
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,920
really fun i think i would have a good

934
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,470
time in that car even if it's not a

935
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,730
German car but that's what matters like

936
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,290
you know if I put my foot down to the

937
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,270
floor like it may not be as fast as some

938
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:03,240
other car but you know a lot of the the

939
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,160
unkind of Motorhead's don't care about

940
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,740
that stuff and so we're seeing a

941
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,830
dramatic change that we only probably

942
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,080
just saw when we went from this world

943
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,720
where everything was just kind of you

944
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,270
know simple screens like this and this

945
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,620
is kind of like the web one point o

946
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,930
world or what have you to now with the

947
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,720
html5 world with Rick's experiences but

948
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,250
the problem is that the complexity is

949
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,590
totally changed like the web used to be

950
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,510
really ugly and crappy which was great

951
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,130
for me because I'm not a graphics guy so

952
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,630
I could build things equal equally

953
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,600
crappy and ugly but everything's changed

954
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,980
you've got all this WebGL and all this

955
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,080
cool stuff now the bar is being raised

956
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,210
and the complexity like building

957
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,040
something even like a rich client you

958
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,000
have to think about things you just

959
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,830
didn't have to think about with a

960
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:50,910
typical kind of terminal screens and one

961
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,080
thing we have to really kind of spend

962
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,060
time on is is kind of the craftsmanship

963
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,220
side of things this guy Alan Cooper

964
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,480
wrote out a whole book kind of talking

965
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,180
about craftsmanship and kind of going

966
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,180
against something that joel joel on

967
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,100
software talked about to do with like

968
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,810
hey if you're in IT like you don't have

969
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,790
time to be a craftsman and kind of

970
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,070
debunk that but he also said it's our

971
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,200
duty to really be craftsmen as we build

972
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,640
in our case these really rich

973
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,550
applications and one example that Ben

974
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,070
and I saw recently was just when the new

975
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,380
version of Firefox 35 came out we

976
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,150
watched the UX team kind of iterate on

977
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,700
it and like how can you like make this

978
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,500
better like Firefox as an icon everyone

979
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,120
knows you're not going to change it and

980
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,620
we just watched him like slowly

981
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,040
iterating through this icon like I'd be

982
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,630
like that's good enough like that's fine

983
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,600
no they keep going keep making subtle

984
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,340
changes they're like arguing about

985
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,080
what's better this than the other which

986
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,569
part of the world is it show

987
00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:49,729
we don't want to show one place and make

988
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:51,140
it seem like that place is better than

989
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,380
somewhere else they just keep going keep

990
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,569
going and that's what they end up with

991
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:59,029
and it's like wow this is like crosman

992
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:00,559
ship you need to keep iterating and like

993
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:02,269
building your craft and building great

994
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:04,910
products and that delivers these amazing

995
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,579
experiences and this brings us to kind

996
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:12,440
of what's happening a lot to do with the

997
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,999
fact that when the bar raises

998
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:17,269
expectations totally change and we saw

999
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,309
this comedian and do a little bit that

1000
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:21,019
really hit home for us as we see these

1001
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:22,910
expectations so we're going to just kind

1002
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,079
of play this for you for a sec

1003
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,569
everything is amazing right now and

1004
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:30,440
nobody's happy like in my lifetime the

1005
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,459
changes in the world have been

1006
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:32,719
incredible when I was a kid we had a

1007
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,969
rotary phone we had a phone they get to

1008
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:37,670
stand next to and you have to dial it

1009
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,619
yes you know you realize how primitive

1010
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:43,549
you're making sparks in a phone and you

1011
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:45,380
actually would hate people with zeros

1012
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,289
and their numbers because it was more

1013
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:53,630
got 20 screw that guy yeah and then if

1014
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,190
they called it you weren't home the

1015
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,259
phone would just ring lonely by itself

1016
00:39:57,259 --> 00:40:00,469
and then with you wanted money you had

1017
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:02,930
to go in the bank for when it was open

1018
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,029
for like three hours it is stay in line

1019
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:08,479
raise up a check like an idiot and then

1020
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:09,650
when you ran out of money you just go

1021
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,930
well I can't do any more things now hey

1022
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,359
I can't do any more that's it yeah that

1023
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:16,039
was it and even if you had a credit card

1024
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,380
they died go oh let me bring out this

1025
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,469
whole chunk chunk Anita right yeah uh do

1026
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:23,950
you have to call the president

1027
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,690
it's all things you had to call the

1028
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,390
president yeah it was ridiculous yes do

1029
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,000
you feel that we now in the 21st century

1030
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,830
we take technology for grant well yeah

1031
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,470
cuz now we live in an amazing amazing

1032
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,630
world and it's wasted on the on the

1033
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,450
crappiest generation of just spoiled

1034
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,820
idiots that don't care because this is

1035
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,960
what people like now they got their

1036
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,470
phone like uh it won't give it a second

1037
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:53,590
it's going to space can you give it a

1038
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,710
second to get back from space is the

1039
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:05,110
speed I was on I was on an airplane and

1040
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,490
there was internet high speed internet

1041
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,870
on the airplane that's the newest thing

1042
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,420
that I know exists and I'm sitting on

1043
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,380
the plane and they go open up your

1044
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,640
laptop you can go on the internet it's

1045
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,560
fast and i'm watching youtube clips it's

1046
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,050
am in an airplane and then it breaks

1047
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,060
down and they apologize the Internet's

1048
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,110
not working the guy next to me dos

1049
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:25,920
boobies both

1050
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,540
like how quickly the world owes him

1051
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,720
something yes he knew existed only 10

1052
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:43,310
seconds ago lying is the worst one

1053
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,720
because people come back from flights

1054
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,060
and they tell you their story and it's

1055
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,710
like a horror story it's they act like

1056
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,900
their flight was like a cattle car in

1057
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,490
the 40s in Germany that's how bad they

1058
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,720
make it sound right there like it was

1059
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,140
the worst day of my life first of all we

1060
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,500
didn't board for 20 minutes and then we

1061
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,240
get on the plane and they made a sit

1062
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,490
there on the runway for 40 minutes we

1063
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,230
had to sit there oh really what happened

1064
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,410
next did you fly through the air

1065
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,630
incredibly like a bird did you partake

1066
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,720
in the miracle of human flight unite

1067
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,940
contributing zero this really hits home

1068
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,270
it's like you suddenly realize that crap

1069
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,890
like first of all I keep complaining

1070
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,120
about flight so I won't do that anymore

1071
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,300
and secondly like once expectations

1072
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,370
change you look at the old thing and

1073
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,440
it's like what and we see this in our

1074
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,330
industry in like games like this was

1075
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,060
cool this was amazing I've got a paddle

1076
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,220
when it can like play this game but now

1077
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,830
we expect this and like kids are today

1078
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,180
playing this and be like you kidding me

1079
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,670
like that's crazy i want immersive

1080
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,850
applications that look beautiful 24-7

1081
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,500
with like all my friends it can do great

1082
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,870
things like expectations change and that

1083
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,150
happens on the web as soon as Google

1084
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,010
Maps came out you go to mapquest and be

1085
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,410
there Mac OS like that sucks you mean I

1086
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,350
hit up and has to reload the page that's

1087
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,170
crazy that's so bad and I think we're

1088
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,270
about to see kind of a similar shift as

1089
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:15,050
we get all these really cool html5 apps

1090
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,820
that do love these really rich things

1091
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,830
again the things that today people used

1092
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,660
to and think are okay they're suddenly

1093
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,310
going to seem really really primitive

1094
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,560
and so I think that's where I'm Kylie oh

1095
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,240
man I I need to like start doing this

1096
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,340
other stuff otherwise I'm going to be a

1097
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,150
dinosaur now kind of how sexy and how

1098
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,550
cool things look actually makes a

1099
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,350
difference and here's an experiment are

1100
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,760
there any ladies in this a geek

1101
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,740
France there any women there's a few

1102
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,690
good any other ladies out they would

1103
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,580
like to go out with this guy is kind of

1104
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,680
a bit of a kind of dough boy a guy bit

1105
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,780
like myself anyone would like to have

1106
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,520
coffee of this game no one how about

1107
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,630
this guy ah so I smile over there that's

1108
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:58,820
good they're the same guy it's jared

1109
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,710
leto an actor that put on this wait for

1110
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,370
a part and what's funny is that while

1111
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,230
the implementation is the same the

1112
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:11,740
interface is totally different perfect

1113
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,660
he's a nice guy in both of these but

1114
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,670
like we react very differently to how

1115
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,250
we'd want to interact with one of these

1116
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,740
interfaces over another so there's the

1117
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,170
universal truths that some of the

1118
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,180
psychologists talk about we talk a lot

1119
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,920
about like getting to know users and how

1120
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,210
they want to use stuff but there's a few

1121
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,700
uniform truths one is sex sells and we

1122
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,510
see that obviously in the media and

1123
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:36,890
movies and stuff and one little fun

1124
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:39,140
example we got the stats on the

1125
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,330
Transformers movies so this is the

1126
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:43,460
original one that came out kind of the

1127
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,230
height of when like all the kids we all

1128
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,750
had transformers and the cartoon was our

1129
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,880
and everyone loved it and opening

1130
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,190
weekend it buddy do million million in

1131
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,070
1.7 million that's pretty good but then

1132
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:59,720
the new one came out and 70 you know

1133
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,790
just a little bit better even if you

1134
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:05,810
take into account inflation and then you

1135
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,040
know there was a particular part of the

1136
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,740
movie that I think drew a certain group

1137
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,320
and Hollywood work that out so the next

1138
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,910
one and 108 million and if you saw the

1139
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:19,670
movie it's kind of awful and was just an

1140
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,940
excuse to get her on screen and so how

1141
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,350
things look actually matter and that

1142
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,940
that kind of goes through the software

1143
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,380
too even though it could be kind of

1144
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,390
weird so there was a study that was done

1145
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,160
all about different UI elements like

1146
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,290
like buttons and over here we've got

1147
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,120
like these two buttons and it's it's

1148
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,470
weird to look at these and be like one

1149
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,510
of these is better than the other one

1150
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,310
but you could kind of look at this and

1151
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,420
be like hey that doesn't even really

1152
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,070
look like a button so i could see how

1153
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,810
people may just think it's just got a

1154
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,850
border and stuff but what if you put

1155
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,770
something that everyone

1156
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,610
knows as a button well it turns out that

1157
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,560
people really didn't like these

1158
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,080
interfaces and people enjoyed using the

1159
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,460
other interfaces a lot more even though

1160
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,500
they were the same and there was a study

1161
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,930
that Don Norman I believe did where he

1162
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:04,690
took an ATM system and had exactly the

1163
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:08,200
same interaction one of the systems was

1164
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,060
just kind of the usual like black screen

1165
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,980
with green writing and the other one was

1166
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,320
like a rich application and they made

1167
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,730
sure the interactions at the same time

1168
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,620
and everything else and at the end of

1169
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,540
the study everyone like thought the one

1170
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,310
that had the pretty stuff was so much

1171
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,170
better even though the interaction was

1172
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:26,230
the same there's another study that is

1173
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:29,140
even scarier that talks about how people

1174
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,230
react to different things in this case

1175
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,420
phases where they took a whole slew of

1176
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,980
people and they took all of like the

1177
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,500
Senate races that happen in the US and

1178
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,480
people had to predict who won the race

1179
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,580
just on looking at two people who were

1180
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,950
running against each other and everyone

1181
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,830
instantly kind of picked the

1182
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,740
better-looking person and that was a 71

1183
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,290
percent indicator that that person

1184
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,200
actually won and they studied that like

1185
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,940
within like the first half a second

1186
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,260
people were making this judgment and

1187
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,140
that's the same indicator as if they're

1188
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,540
already in office like it's crazy that

1189
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,860
they'd look at people be like that guy's

1190
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:10,900
more capable and the funniest part of

1191
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,030
this was at the end of the report just

1192
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,800
to make sure you know people like to sue

1193
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,750
each other in the US they said

1194
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,550
unfortunately no good evidence suggests

1195
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,320
the inferences drawn from a person's

1196
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,270
facial appearance can predict character

1197
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:24,040
or skills so they had to put a

1198
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,420
disclaimer sand the good looking guys

1199
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,060
aren't necessarily better their job just

1200
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,010
kind of bizarre but there's a thing this

1201
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,480
is called the halo effect and we see

1202
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,550
that on the web and another study done

1203
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:36,190
in the University of Ontario would take

1204
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,460
different websites here's an example and

1205
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,020
again within like half a second people

1206
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,910
would make assumptions based on this

1207
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,610
website they were like look at this this

1208
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:46,960
thing versus another one and they'd be

1209
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,970
like is this a trustworthy business

1210
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:50,200
would i give my credit card to these

1211
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,480
guys are they competent and would

1212
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,060
instantly make these judgments and it's

1213
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,640
just kind of intrinsic to how is you do

1214
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,860
stuff in our brains so this stuff really

1215
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,060
really matters

1216
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,390
and to hammer it home again is a little

1217
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,490
case study that's fun does anyone use

1218
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:08,680
delicious library on the mac does anyone

1219
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,630
use that few people over there so

1220
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,460
delicious library this is the first

1221
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,010
version so the latest one it does a lot

1222
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:17,080
more but the first version that came out

1223
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,780
as this application that allows you to

1224
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,150
take your DVDs and books and you can

1225
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,470
kind of put in the information it gives

1226
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,200
you this like virtual deck that you

1227
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,350
could look at and when I first saw this

1228
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,360
is I oh this is cool like maybe I could

1229
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,040
like double click on the DVD and it

1230
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,900
stopped playing it nope can't do that

1231
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,910
maybe I could read the book click on the

1232
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,500
book no can't do that I could literally

1233
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,410
put in my information look at this or

1234
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,480
look at my bookshelf unlike that was it

1235
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,100
and the innovation was this feature here

1236
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,780
was kind of cool at the time where you

1237
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,730
could put the the code up to the webcam

1238
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,440
and it would scan it and automatically

1239
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,390
put in the information and you could

1240
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,850
like drag a book to a friend and it

1241
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,080
would say like you've loaned it to him

1242
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,690
but that's it you could use Excel really

1243
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,120
easily to do that you could use one of

1244
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,670
the millions of like inventory systems

1245
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,410
out there but he basically took

1246
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,600
something made it look really nice had

1247
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,510
amazing attention to detail and did it

1248
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:19,960
matter well yeah he sold 500,000 in

1249
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,210
three months yet this is literally his

1250
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,660
car he bought this car and as a bit of

1251
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,340
an ego so he blogged about buying this

1252
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,070
car and a fifty four thousand dollars of

1253
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,330
profit in the first day without doing

1254
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,150
any advertising at all he literally took

1255
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,950
something that had a little bit of use

1256
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:39,130
not too much made it just beautiful to

1257
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:41,140
use and people bought it I bought it and

1258
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,330
I've used it like three times and it's

1259
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,220
just like so nice to use you want to use

1260
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,170
it this stuff actually really works and

1261
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,210
that then bought him time to go ahead

1262
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,920
and like innovate and add features and

1263
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,860
stuff so this like directly really

1264
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,960
really matters but I'm not trying to say

1265
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,910
just like make put lipstick on a pig and

1266
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,050
make it look better because that goes

1267
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:05,400
wrong too

1268
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,210
so remember the campaign it was all

1269
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,980
about the WoW starts now and all this

1270
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,680
kind of stuff it's not just about the

1271
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,240
visual side of things you've got to get

1272
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,440
the into the integration stuff worked

1273
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,140
out well and jef raskin talks a lot

1274
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,390
about this and i kind of shows you why

1275
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,550
vista did so badly is like the

1276
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:28,430
experience of the interaction just

1277
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,740
poisons you and like we've all been

1278
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,760
there we've been working with different

1279
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,560
programs you get frustrated you want to

1280
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,240
like throw the mouse out the window kind

1281
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,280
of thing mr. did that all the time right

1282
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,750
we're just like pop up are you sure you

1283
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:42,650
want to click on that go away and so we

1284
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,580
need to make sure that we obviously

1285
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,140
don't poison our users and given

1286
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,690
fantastic experiences so there's

1287
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,280
actually kind of two sides to design

1288
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,770
there's the visual staff which I'm never

1289
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,119
going to be good at I just don't have

1290
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,550
that feel that's just like a fashion and

1291
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,050
we talked about that's importance but

1292
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,090
then there's the interaction design

1293
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,250
which is the geeky nerds like watching

1294
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,910
exactly how people interact with things

1295
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,280
and yakima nielsen talks about you know

1296
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,260
one of the laws which is you have to

1297
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,240
make sure every interaction there

1298
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,150
directly manipulate in those objects if

1299
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,730
you're able to do that the user's brain

1300
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,530
can stay in the flow and they feel like

1301
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,960
they're really enjoying that experience

1302
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,060
and this again ties back to the fact

1303
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,980
that now we can do that with web workers

1304
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,080
and the javascript engines we can make

1305
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,280
sure that we do this kind of stuff

1306
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,530
whereas before you think about you know

1307
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,359
even before ajax every different thing

1308
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:35,359
you did record every a reload like that

1309
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,010
would obviously be longer than that for

1310
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,619
every every bit of time and there's a

1311
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:41,119
little tool out there this on zai Jian

1312
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,490
on Ben's I that allow you to kind of

1313
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:44,900
play around with that just click on

1314
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,430
these things and kind of see how you

1315
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,740
feel when you're working with these

1316
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,080
different kind of time lapses and you

1317
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,359
really notice the difference you know

1318
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,369
particularly around here been you know

1319
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:57,260
thinks is a really high tuned individual

1320
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,820
so he even knows the difference up here

1321
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,000
but you really notice it really really

1322
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,290
matters the other kind of thing that we

1323
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,330
have to do is make sure that everything

1324
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,700
a user does is sacred and so we see that

1325
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,230
in different UI is with

1326
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,359
you know saving stayed and restoring our

1327
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:16,940
sessions now and getting rid of the

1328
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,070
notion of actually saving something and

1329
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:21,530
we all know how frustrating this is like

1330
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:23,240
the web has this notion of sessions but

1331
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,460
users don't care about it and it drives

1332
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,290
me nuts when I go to something like a

1333
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:29,180
travel side and I get a phone call and I

1334
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,220
come back and says sorry all that stuff

1335
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,080
you put in like got to do it again and

1336
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,540
we run into this again and again and

1337
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:39,290
again and so we have to make sure that

1338
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,760
we actually do a better job and these

1339
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,290
are just kind of two there's millions of

1340
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,100
things we could talk about with

1341
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,260
interaction design but if we make sure

1342
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,990
that we do good on the responsiveness

1343
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,030
which we can now do on the web and make

1344
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,760
sure we really take good care of users

1345
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,600
input we can get a long way so it feels

1346
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,030
like when we first started to do browser

1347
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,770
apps like nothing changed for like ten

1348
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,170
years in the browser I was incredibly

1349
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,150
frustrated in place for us as web

1350
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,560
developers to try and innovate and

1351
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,080
deliver great applications and then Ajax

1352
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,330
came along which made the winter a

1353
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,070
little bit nicer to live with the

1354
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:14,920
browser still weren't really helping us

1355
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,260
but now we've got all of these fantastic

1356
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,090
technologies that all these great you

1357
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,109
know speakers are going to be talking

1358
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:22,250
around you guys are going to be using

1359
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,440
though enable us to finally deliver

1360
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,810
these expectations that are going to

1361
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:28,609
take us to the next level and they're

1362
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:30,260
just going to make the web amazing and

1363
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,210
make people's lives actually a lot

1364
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,910
better and so you know the web has a ton

1365
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,890
of stuff going for it right now I'm

1366
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:39,350
incredibly excited about where we're

1367
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,080
going and most importantly you've got

1368
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,210
job security on your side because

1369
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:47,060
there's a TV show in the US that's a

1370
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,580
sci-fi show and if you zoom into the

1371
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,070
user experience of the the show this is

1372
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:56,300
in like 2500 they use JavaScript so make

1373
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,580
sure you keep your JavaScript skills and

1374
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,500
i'll see you at a jazz conf in the
