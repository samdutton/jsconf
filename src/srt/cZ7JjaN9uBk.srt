1
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,680

is it on great all right thanks

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,740
everybody for being here what an amazing

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,140
conference we all I think had a massive

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,840
blast until so far and let's see what

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,189
happens I hope we will survive this

6
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:32,930
there's some electricity involved and I

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,059
saw there's a fire extinguisher over

8
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:36,200
there so I think everything is going to

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,980
be fine so let's get started yeah we're

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,780
going to quickly just have an

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,899
introduction my name is Nicola aankhen

12
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,329
I'm from Germany living in Amsterdam

13
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:54,620
from Cebu and basically I got involved

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,109
with this whole Arduino controlling

15
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:58,609
hardware with JavaScript last year

16
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:02,120
jsbach then we just had the idea hey we

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,070
have phone gap with mobile devices but

18
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,750
we don't have any AP is to control

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,220
hardware and that's really what we

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,320
should be able to do so I've set up this

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,140
bluetooth setup so you could talk to the

22
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,509
Arduino via bluetooth that kind of was

23
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:18,770
very unstable so now we do kind of USB

24
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,340
cable cable ish things that's about we

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,090
yeah so I'm Jen sephora and from Cologne

26
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,670
Germany I've been here last year

27
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,549
presented about Jack VI but as we figure

28
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,469
out that all the JavaScript frameworks

29
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,789
that run the browser are kind of boring

30
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:37,310
now we excited to focus on something

31
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,420
more fun and apart from the idea stuff

32
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,990
which nick lang proposed as talk almost

33
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,320
the idea of trying to find some example

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,820
that are really easy to reproduce the

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,520
Bailey everyone else can try this out

36
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,520
too and we'll get you these very soon

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,520
but for now let's talk about our mission

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,039
yeah so this will be the introduction

39
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,740
before we start the hacking action we

40
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,409
have a mission and our mission everybody

41
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,800
knows this is of course it's a bit slow

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,720
but javascript to rule the world

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,660
right as doctors did you sit tomorrow if

44
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,310
I can be one language to do to that it

45
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,370
should be JavaScript I mean browsers we

46
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,710
need much more than that yeah so first

47
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,550
there was was a long time ago that's how

48
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,950
it all started then for a long time

49
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:39,490
there was nothing nothing happened as we

50
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,330
all know and now we have robots and then

51
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,750
so he want with the JavaScript there's a

52
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,790
little hook to the to the action so to

53
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,540
say yeah fortunately our robot became

54
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,730
sentient we had to shut him down we were

55
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,610
to prevent future Skynet he was instead

56
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,680
he was afraid of all those drinking

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,620
people here yeah so we really actually

58
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,780
are that far but I mean it's the first

59
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,780
step we can now turn off turn off stuff

60
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,940
turn on lights turn now turn off lights

61
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,580
open doors and whatever and really with

62
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,959
the Arduino you can do much more but

63
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,050
right now that's how far we are so

64
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,540
that's really all all the slides we have

65
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,739
the rest of this will be kind of like a

66
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,239
genuine emmaus nanometer mouse psyche

67
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:34,120
German TV show fastest under yeah so we

68
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,280
need we need some people we may make

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,959
this couch here you see it very

70
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,440
comfortable and we need holder Martin

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,830
and Chris where are you there you are

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,980
we're gonna do some experiments with

73
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,260
these guys first of all give give all of

74
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,420
them a huge huge applause for setting

75
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:09,520
all this up amazing really

76
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,330
alright so to start off if gets

77
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,280
something that is really safe and easy

78
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,600
to reproduce the dwarf this nut socket

79
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,479
which includes some software with the

80
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,940
web server so we can actually control

81
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,690
this web server of HTTP three of these

82
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,350
sockets get contained relate so we can

83
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,650
switch them off on and off basically

84
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,080
I've got this little notch as proxy

85
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,260
which excludes HTTP client exit the

86
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,840
socket and includes the web server so we

87
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,240
have our own UI here see if this is

88
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,570
still working nope like to restart the

89
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:58,650
server robots alright man we've got the

90
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,410
net control yes so to start off I think

91
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,449
we need some lights and nothing's

92
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:13,960
happening so let's see is it connected

93
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:20,250
we got to get there so let's see the

94
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:26,360
weapon to physics right is still working

95
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,629
nope it's plated so we can't reach the

96
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:34,180
sockets or something there doesn't work

97
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,840
is tenor let's just have it reconnect so

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,729
in the meantime we really wanted to

99
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,439
bring a real blender you know like to

100
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,949
make actual drinks and here we go this

101
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,650
is what we have and this it's always

102
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,319
there this is going to be the blender

103
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,039
for making drinks today I won't turn it

104
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,560
on here I promise it's actually going to

105
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,909
be turned on the right now should

106
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,969
actually be working let's see for that

107
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:13,270
to set off some next up some music let's

108
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,279
see that couple is really cheap radio

109
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:23,710
clock here might miss be good enough and

110
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,139
now to get these important part how much

111
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:43,909
you want

112
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,900
so not a little bit one way to go to

113
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,520
automate that as well but for now its

114
00:06:51,520 --> 00:07:02,900
turn on already and I'll going to switch

115
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:11,500
it's for me I mean to the oven on ok

116
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:29,970
time to get freaky

117
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,350
this for Chris extra extra can wake up

118
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,030
yeah that's the window for the next

119
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,860
contract kisses yes this is where you

120
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:53,360
good so only for anyone anyone here okay

121
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,370
so you get drink it now and then we'll

122
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,060
do some more shitty music phenomena

123
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,060
relief on the disco light of course next

124
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,470
up is their remote this is just as

125
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,530
normal remembered you can get it any

126
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:16,130
star 40 euros so we need cheap to get

127
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,250
started some of these experiments and

128
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,540
most computers included support soon

129
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,680
Reuters can be a bit annoying to get

130
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,310
connected to but it's completely can't

131
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,650
you see it I've got this extra soft foam

132
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,450
which makes it easier to connect it on

133
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,729
Windows once actually set up set it up

134
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,200
once it's really easy to connect it

135
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,810
again so just you select a big next

136
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,300
option here press one and two runs and I

137
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,330
don't blink a bit and you know dialogue

138
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,250
should pop up which says a little case

139
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,460
nor displayed here it's not connected so

140
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,650
it's continuous blinking for now because

141
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,230
doesn't know what you do it otherwise

142
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,600
but we'll make it you something so one

143
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,380
of those here is should have combed them

144
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,530
only chose instead of extending anyway

145
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,470
oh so we've got this little command line

146
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,240
tool we get you the extra code for that

147
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,610
minute once I will start it got this

148
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,940
script here let's play a bit of da start

149
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,470
a countdown and now script is running

150
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,080
and they can shake it and 45 settings I

151
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,540
can get try to get a high score so so

152
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,680
finish those days and they were

153
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,020
integrated the excessive greed source of

154
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,240
the x-axis so you actually

155
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,520
shake it that way and the addition I get

156
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,820
contest and we'll see can get the best

157
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,980
score you can set up set up what we want

158
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,520
so you don't hit anyone and it's got a

159
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,589
count of three seconds so when it says

160
00:09:44,589 --> 00:10:40,270
go it's actually reading your

161
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,320
missing if you it's not out because if

162
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,130
you started then one and once it's once

163
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,160
going they'll actually and he made the

164
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,590
LEDs so you can see that you please get

165
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,080
another chance again yeah they give you

166
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:24,369
another chance after shaking sexy notes

167
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:27,540
good job okay oh I think not even

168
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,420
disrepair harder win this round with 33

169
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,699
points though Chris gets bonus action

170
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:37,499
for but I think you were a logo tonight

171
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:40,470
I Chris get a coupon so crushing the jvm

172
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,929
so you actually now know what's running

173
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:45,929
this stuff so let's take a like to look

174
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:49,790
at the code for this little game and

175
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,579
before we get to that forgot one slap of

176
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,730
this so this stack actually consists of

177
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,369
a few elements we've got a see library

178
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:01,199
to connect to the remote we have

179
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:03,629
bluetooth so there's the windows

180
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,970
Bluetooth stack and the C library to

181
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,170
correct event so that would be good

182
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,550
candidates to actually create a binding

183
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,529
for node.js we don't have that yet but

184
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,350
should be infection no bit about that

185
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,509
should be fairly easy then there's a

186
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:18,600
rapper library in Java for connect using

187
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,649
the seal a brief for the remote in Java

188
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,220
and as we've got that already i'm using

189
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,259
grindr to run JavaScript Jax's channel

190
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:29,999
having sexs sea snakes and access the vm

191
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,610
over bluetooth and then i wrote a bit of

192
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,309
makkah jquery api in order to script a

193
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:39,660
vmail work just like you could with

194
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,759
description it with jquery wherever I

195
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,939
section running and this demo while

196
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:47,220
you've seen what it does so let's look

197
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,230
at bit of the carrot so this file

198
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,870
actually includes both a bit of

199
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,360
infrastructure code and the actual game

200
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,480
can say so it's all on github already so

201
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,179
this is the part that handles election

202
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,179
motion celexa promote finds the motion

203
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,569
event then wraps the raw java remote

204
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:12,059
object in order to get this pseudo

205
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,199
jquery object this starter variable as

206
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,699
set somewhere else we'll get to that in

207
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:20,220
a second and then it just checks the

208
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,470
event as there are acceleration of x

209
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,149
axis over 240 so they're valued probably

210
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:30,209
goes up to 255 and anything about above

211
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:30,570
to

212
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,760
50 special impossible to reach kind of

213
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,710
check as much you want doesn't happen so

214
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,470
this is close enough to actually make it

215
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,570
sort of difficult and then basically

216
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,730
just counts blocks out the counter you

217
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,290
didn't see that and then sets on the

218
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,020
LEDs from then we mode and then use this

219
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,150
little helper to basically only made

220
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,580
limbs off again so everyone at 50

221
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,710
milliseconds one of these is executed so

222
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,510
lady I can actually see see if if you

223
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,240
make the right moves a little animate

224
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,430
them off and unless it continued chick

225
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,150
so the countdown and starting the script

226
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,280
is here use the same stagger method with

227
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,000
one-second delay and then for exiting

228
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,550
the game another timeout turns off the

229
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,810
LEDs put get put out puts the finishing

230
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,810
score and exit the event which get

231
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:25,380
started in the last so scripted a bit of

232
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,210
infrastructure here which basically

233
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,500
imports a few stuff from Java left

234
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,430
packages to work with fix the console

235
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,340
log object to the to map to the Rhino

236
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,880
print line creates a little timeout

237
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,340
method and for also for clearing and

238
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,620
checking timeouts and then finally

239
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,650
there's a custom loop which you probably

240
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,230
wouldn't have to do in no chairs because

241
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,000
not always includes the actual lube but

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,620
this basically just makes them

243
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,530
thread.sleep ft fifth 1215 minutes

244
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,690
seconds then ceases and there any

245
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,690
timeouts and digital the java library

246
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,610
for the MV mode it will actually trigger

247
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,170
the events so we can take a look at the

248
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,230
actual mock jquery api which is really

249
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,700
just the market doesn't include any

250
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,110
actual jquery code little if they select

251
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,630
their equals we mowed the string and use

252
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,000
this we use API manager to get the BMO

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,980
if it can't find anything it'll just

254
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,510
return ab the objects or just like

255
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,570
jquery would if we pass and actually be

256
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,550
more object it'll basically use that as

257
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,030
a selector and then it returns and

258
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,400
which object which include assume method

259
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,880
to bind and the LED method below here

260
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,880
which basically just forwards method

261
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,760
causes the java objects while the bind

262
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,160
method from now just checks if them

263
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,870
event is anything other than motion

264
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,280
because we don't support that yet and

265
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,660
then returns then there's a bit of stuff

266
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,510
here all this status event methods to

267
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,860
display the petrol level just once also

268
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,810
adds are conceived and so that if you

269
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,170
press the home button little exit and

270
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,880
then the actual interesting stuff on the

271
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,920
motion sensing event which basically

272
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,020
splits just a Java interface here it'll

273
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,520
use the callback that the user provided

274
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,890
and pass along a new object mapping

275
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,540
again the Java object should be some

276
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,490
more useful JavaScript object so that

277
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,650
you don't have to calm attitude and just

278
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,820
exist these figs properties and then

279
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,920
just cause get status one so that we can

280
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,650
actually i'll put the battery level yeah

281
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,400
so next step would be to bind the Java

282
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,900
API then civi for remote access to know

283
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,960
Jas and they can use replacing we're at

284
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,270
this in Dolce has maybe we use even

285
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,950
actual Jake wake up and that's for the

286
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,160
remote stuff alright so we need to

287
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,180
switch couple of things what

288
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,970
oh that's my flight somewhere else did

289
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:23,060
you drink right not enough ok so what he

290
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:28,040
knows the Arduino board nice it's really

291
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,690
cool so we all could just build some

292
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,180
stuff actually right now I was just on

293
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,830
the website of vino and they actually

294
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,600
are releasing a new board today which is

295
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,920
pretty cool I don't know what the specs

296
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,800
are it I assume it's going to be a lot

297
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,600
more interesting than what we have right

298
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,130
now but anyway so what I have here it's

299
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,420
it's a little bit small to see but here

300
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,080
a kind of dangerous prototype where I

301
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,580
have the Arduino board which is

302
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,350
connected to your serial connection to

303
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,610
to the laptop and then the Arduino is

304
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,370
driving a relay and the relays then

305
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,920
triggering 220 volt to turn off or turn

306
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,330
on lights so I'm going to this is the

307
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,000
dangerous part down fold your thumbs

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,160
everybody so I'm going to show first I'm

309
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,870
just going to show the demo first and

310
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,340
then I'm going to explain what actually

311
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:27,200
is happening there so here I've my iPad

312
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,020
connected to the network I have a little

313
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,400
little interface which I can use to

314
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,620
trigger the different pins on the

315
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:41,720
Arduino and now if I triggered you if

316
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,640
you listen really well I'll be quiet you

317
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,820
hear the real a switching near that ok

318
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,960
so this works and now I'm going to

319
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,450
connect the wish me luck

320
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:01,970
yeah going to connect the this disco

321
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:08,600
light to the are we can we turn down the

322
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,800
light a little bit because of course we

323
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,470
need some music before we do disco

324
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,040
action I'm going to turn on sound out

325
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:30,110
though so I'm just going to give the

326
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,330
ipad or you can only hit the first

327
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,610
button there are on

328
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:54,830
is working hello

329
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:04,940
you're really good bday amazing

330
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:22,840
if you ladies below it

331
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:31,630
he's intelligent yeah

332
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,910
anyways I'll just keep it to just a

333
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,389
strong I'm gonna

334
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:43,340
the work

335
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:50,380
okay yeah okay so basically just to run

336
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,700
through what's actually happening I have

337
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,140
the album Eno here it's connected to a

338
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,850
serial serial connection to the laptop

339
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,910
I'm running node on my laptop and the

340
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,950
really really amazing serial node module

341
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,050
written by Chris it's totally working

342
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,270
also i also the school in a second and

343
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,430
it's for JavaScript developer it can't

344
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,990
be any easier to do all this kind of

345
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,780
stuff so i'm using the serial connection

346
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,270
and then Toby Taylor he's somewhere here

347
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,240
up there he started to ride out we know

348
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,100
Jas which is basically sort of mimicking

349
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,130
the api's we have on the Arduino which

350
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,450
we would have to write in C to

351
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,860
JavaScript so we can actually use the

352
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,050
same api's JavaScript and say something

353
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,730
like analog read or any luck right and

354
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,240
then it's mapping into the Arduino so

355
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:41,140
here you see my my f home control let's

356
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,620
start from the Arduino side of things

357
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,929
basically what we have here in the loop

358
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,040
we are reading the different of course

359
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,780
we're receiving to the serial connection

360
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,820
and basically just triggering digital

361
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,980
right to delete analog pride and liquid

362
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,140
and we could extend this too much more

363
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,550
things right now it's very simple we can

364
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,260
as i said we can just turn things on and

365
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,780
off but there's much more we could

366
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,490
actually do to get stuff running so this

367
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,870
is the other the Arduino side of things

368
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,880
you just compile the code uploaded it to

369
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,860
the board through a USB and then you're

370
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,140
ready to roll from the both side of

371
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,790
things now here we have the Arduino j/s

372
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,410
which basically does exactly the same

373
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,809
thing but in JavaScript so here you see

374
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,210
our op codes which are triggering the

375
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,250
different functions and then here you

376
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,780
have basically I mean if you compared

377
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,929
it's it's almost exactly the same so in

378
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:34,600
JavaScript I can say arduino pin mode

379
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,460
and then it triggers the pinmode

380
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,970
function on the Arduino itself the thing

381
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,190
is we we running node and I want to have

382
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,050
the same API in the browser so this is

383
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,750
this this JavaScript key is used both by

384
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,840
node and by the

385
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,280
now notice connecting to the Arduino

386
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,140
through the serial connection so here I

387
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,570
have a sort of i call it the provided

388
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,490
maybe not the best naming but here the

389
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,260
serial provider which basically is using

390
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,650
the serial volume by chris and really if

391
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,930
you look at the code all we do is we

392
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,340
require a serial port native and then

393
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,610
literally all you have to do is you have

394
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,560
to provide the path to the USB device

395
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:19,500
and then in JavaScript this is your your

396
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,120
line of code you have to write to

397
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,040
connect to a serial device which is

398
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,680
amazing I mean in JavaScript this is

399
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,480
exactly what we want to do we don't want

400
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,810
to be nice we don't want to write any

401
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,270
any more low-level than that and if it

402
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,040
works like this this is just perfect it

403
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,450
makes it really really easy to get start

404
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,660
with with these kind of things so now

405
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,790
we're in node notice creating the

406
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,330
connection to the Arduino with the

407
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,260
serial provider on the front end side of

408
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,300
things I'm connecting to the node

409
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,980
instance through a socket connection and

410
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,850
they're basically again all i do is one

411
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,310
line of code almost i ordered socket

412
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,200
that's it and then if i show the actual

413
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,540
javascript code of the little interface

414
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:12,630
i have there I'm instantiating a new

415
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,490
board arduino connect i connect to the

416
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,160
arduino board and then i'm just calling

417
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,200
for digital right i provide the pin

418
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,390
which I want to talk to and the action I

419
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,280
want to do so turn on or turn off that's

420
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,650
it exactly the same API as we would have

421
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,490
on the outer we know and I can just show

422
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,850
it here chrome the cone crushers with

423
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:39,560
the web sockets sometimes

424
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,770
so I can figure it and you can trigger

425
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,630
it at the same time from the from the

426
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,790
ipad which is pretty cool if you think

427
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,179
about it i mean the the use cases is

428
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,490
very very basic and we can do much much

429
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,590
more you can drive CFO's with the

430
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,530
arduino motors whatever all kinds of

431
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,780
things so there's huge potential of what

432
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:05,230
we can do really yes if you if you if

433
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,910
you have a mobile phone right now and if

434
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,470
you would connect to my network you

435
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,860
could just now also open up the it's 10

436
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,929
orange yeah but don't source know what

437
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:19,780
is it so the weekend we can actually try

438
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,910
the network is ww chest let's see if we

439
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,570
can burn this down so so if you connect

440
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,520
with your iPhone or whatever to ww test

441
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,720
and then the IP is a 10 point zero point

442
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,100
two point one get what is it oh do you

443
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:48,169
know Jas apps i think yeah home control

444
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,100
static there you go so if you put this

445
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,840
into your phone anyone is trying it okay

446
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,940
as if we should should I should have

447
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:10,220
made it to our L but

448
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:20,230
who was that nice or nice i'm not going

449
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,850
to be good follow up shortly we could

450
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,769
attach it to a laser i don't know i'm

451
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:43,560
not only didn't of course yeah

452
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,670
so you can literally build any kind of

453
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,670
eps controlling controlling hardware of

454
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,290
course this is like prototyping and this

455
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,090
you wouldn't really use this at home

456
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,910
unless you're crazy a little bit but if

457
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,110
you think about it you can actually

458
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,940
build hardware now and and control it

459
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,160
with JavaScript and that's that's

460
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,780
something which which is very exciting i

461
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,800
find because we're just getting into a

462
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,900
whole new you sort of area of java

463
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,690
development which we haven't really done

464
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:12,460
before did anyone else connect to it did

465
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:24,870
it work how cool yes someone is blocking

466
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,559
yeah okay so just a few more info if you

467
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,030
want to get started we actually have a

468
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,919
couple of boards here and I think it

469
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,990
would be really really cool to to solder

470
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,440
a je s conf logo in using LEDs and then

471
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,000
make it blink or whatever with a nice

472
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,159
interface maybe we can do it later we

473
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,840
can see but basically if you want to get

474
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,909
started with the Arduino just check out

475
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:48,980
Audrina dot CC it's a really cheap board

476
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,840
it's like 30 30 years or something you

477
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,159
can order it online and then just get

478
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,580
started right away notes here is on get

479
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,400
up so you can just plug that into your

480
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,929
note instance and then get rolling with

481
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,460
that we use socket i/o awesome for the

482
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,929
socket work and that's basically it

483
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:08,570
really took took a couple of days or a

484
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,490
couple of hours we need to actually put

485
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,870
everything together the biggest

486
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,780
challenge was the 220 volt kind of kind

487
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,549
of part because there was a bit scary

488
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:18,500
and you don't really want to play with

489
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,490
the electricity I think the source code

490
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,760
for arduino Jas is on github as well you

491
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,890
can just fork it and extend it and just

492
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,809
try it out it makes it super easy to

493
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,100
start doing these kind of things

494
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:38,360
basically so yeah yeah I mean we need

495
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,510
some pie charts of course and Patrick so

496
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,020
in 2009 at the jas comp in DC not

497
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,640
specially all client side JavaScript

498
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,510
check right Jojo whatever so we've got

499
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,539
moved on a bit last year here in belen

500
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,640
loft already got much more our server

501
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,650
side stuff especially with ryan in this

502
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,120
amazing noches talk this year Washington

503
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,159
was more like 5050 and now try to

504
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:15,469
introduce

505
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:19,450
and we hope for to be that in this dream

506
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,509
start of getting to even more of that so

507
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:24,399
next next year we totally want to see

508
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,009
your robots I mean this year we were

509
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:28,629
turning stuff on and off which is really

510
00:29:28,629 --> 00:29:31,359
cool but next year we need to like steer

511
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,829
robots with our mobile phones and

512
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:38,320
everything in JavaScript so yeah as I

513
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,789
said we have a bunch of stuff here we

514
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:41,139
have a soldering iron if anyone really

515
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:42,700
wants to start solving some stuff we can

516
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,459
we can do it LEDs and everything if

517
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:47,649
anyone actually knows how to do electric

518
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:49,119
stuff because I actually don't really

519
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,759
know it I was just putting the cables

520
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,839
together would be a great help i think

521
00:29:54,839 --> 00:30:01,389
so that's that's basically it yeah so

522
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:09,820
thanks for listening

523
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:15,270
give it here

524
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,380
are there any of you any personal

525
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:25,120
questions crazy any questions about the

526
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:33,760
soft

527
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:43,330
ok

528
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:53,250
nice great the other yes

529
00:30:53,260 --> 00:31:18,960
could you repeat it

530
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,130
absolutely i mean you can do it there's

531
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,630
a whole bunch of libraries for the other

532
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,800
video which you can use actually I I set

533
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,630
up bluetooth as well so you can just

534
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,000
connect from your phone directly to the

535
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,260
board to bluetooth it's just really

536
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:38,970
unstable because it's a jailbreak device

537
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:47,660
okay yeah so if you actually want to

538
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,190
build a home network with the sender

539
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,760
that I connected a little white wireless

540
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,620
there's two protocols zigbee and

541
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,940
satellite that may be interesting to

542
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,850
look at both had some weaknesses zigbee

543
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,470
is not the standard that wave it's not

544
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,220
but the harbor's with cheap not let me

545
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,140
something to look at and look for

546
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,550
watching you could actually interact

547
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,620
with JavaScript of these mass protocols

548
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,150
because the interesting thing there's

549
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,370
you can Absalom this here and then there

550
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,650
and the range from my controller to the

551
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,570
last tender would be too long that they

552
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,550
can connect using other nodes in the

553
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,250
network without actually other access

554
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,990
points which is really interesting for

555
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:31,160
stuff like that any more questions
