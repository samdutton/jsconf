1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,180

can you all hear me okay all right oh

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,340
cool so my name is Nora Casper again I'm

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,250
here from Washington DC and my talk is

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,719
called empathy as a service supporting

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,820
mental health in the tech workplace and

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,560
I'm actually gonna save most of my self

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,210
introduction for the second part of the

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,800
talk I first want to cover some of the

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,810
statistics and definitions and things

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,160
like that related to mental health and

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,390
mental illness to make sure that we're

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,640
all kind of on the same page here

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,529
then I'll go more into my own story and

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,960
why this is so important to me but then

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,369
the bulk of the talk is really going to

16
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,920
be focused on things all of us can do in

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,920
our own workplaces and our own lives

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,530
common sense action-oriented things that

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,910
we can all put into action to support

20
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,250
mental health better and then there's a

21
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,750
short section on the end on things that

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,879
we all have to do together or

23
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,829
essentially it's it's more difficult and

24
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,480
more aspirational but still needs to be

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,260
done so first what are we talking about

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,510
so if there's anything that I want you

27
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,030
all to walk away from here with it's

28
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,160
this statistic it's that one in five

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,049
adults are living with mental illness at

30
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,840
any given time that's a huge number in

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,220
fact it basically means that mental

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,360
illness is one of the most prevalent

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,460
chronic health conditions but if you

34
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,200
think about it we really don't ever talk

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,540
about it

36
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,830
and to be clear when I say mental

37
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,689
illness I'm talking about any one of

38
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,900
these when some of these may you may

39
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,250
have heard of before some of these you

40
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,470
may not have another thing is there's

41
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,270
this phenomenon called comorbidities

42
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,829
which means that when you have one of

43
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,630
these illnesses it also often makes you

44
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,000
more prone to develop another illness so

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,770
for example depression and anxiety often

46
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,990
go together depression and substance use

47
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,570
disorder ADHD and anxiety often go

48
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,020
together etc to that I wanted to kind of

49
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,450
point out specifically our autism

50
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,200
spectrum disorders and burnout so autism

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,210
spectrum disorders are kind of part of

52
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,060
this bigger umbrella term of mental

53
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,549
disorders but they're often accompanied

54
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,020
by other things like learning

55
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,820
disabilities sometimes also physical

56
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,780
health issues and so they often require

57
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,189
their own kinds of treatments and

58
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,590
interventions etc so organizations that

59
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,959
focus on activism around mental health

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,480
often focus either on some of the rest

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,750
of these like depression and

62
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,120
xiety or autism spectrum disorder

63
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,710
specifically just because there was

64
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,950
required more specialized treatments and

65
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,480
so I'm not going to talk too much about

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,030
autism spectrum disorders today because

67
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,530
the organization that I work with is

68
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,150
focused more on the other kinds of

69
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,590
mental illnesses but there's still quite

70
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,420
a bit of overlap and a lot of what I'm

71
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,650
going to talk about is still relevant

72
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,230
for autism as well and then obviously

73
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,550
we're gonna be talking a lot about the

74
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,830
workplace so I wanted to call out the

75
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,740
idea of burnout especially in the United

76
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,620
States were where I come from when the

77
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,300
idea of burnout was introduced in the

78
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,270
1970s there was quite a bit of pushback

79
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,860
people said you know that's silly the

80
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,300
whole idea that you can get sick from

81
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,940
working too much so I did some research

82
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,070
and looked into you know where are we at

83
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,350
in 2018 what does the research nowadays

84
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,300
say and most psychologists actually

85
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,830
agreed that burnout is actually

86
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,050
depression they did a lot of studies

87
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,640
that show that at the end of the day on

88
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,930
when they control for all kinds of

89
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,640
factors the symptoms are essentially the

90
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,550
same but it is essentially depression

91
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,140
with a very specific cause which is

92
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,970
prolonged stress from working too much

93
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,400
so it's fine to continue to refer to it

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,510
as burnout we don't have to say

95
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,000
depression necessarily but I just

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,799
figured since we're gonna be talking

97
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,330
about the workplace that's an important

98
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,060
thing to know about but a big problem

99
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,250
with mental illness is that there's

100
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,200
often kind of preconceived notions about

101
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
what that means so if I say mental

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,190
illness to a random stranger chances are

103
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,239
they're gonna think of something like

104
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,900
schizophrenia but in fact depression in

105
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,150
particular is one of the most common

106
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,040
mental illnesses and it's at least 13

107
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,220
times more prevalent than schizophrenia

108
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,959
another big problem is there's lots of

109
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,790
misunderstandings about things like the

110
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,450
symptoms of depression so we often

111
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,489
associated with things like feelings of

112
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,160
sadness emptiness loss of interest and

113
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,620
pleasure in normal activities and

114
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,019
tiredness and lack of energy but there's

115
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,790
actually a whole spectrum of emotions

116
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,500
that's possible when you're suffering

117
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,060
from depression so it can also include

118
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,860
things like angry outbursts and

119
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,900
irritability any kind of sleep

120
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,730
disturbances which can be insomnia or

121
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,340
sleeping too much any kind of changes in

122
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,019
appetite and anxiety agitation or

123
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,270
restlessness and in fact one thing that

124
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,010
they're finding recently is that when

125
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,510
women experience depression they're much

126
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,550
more likely to experience the

127
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,110
of sadness and emptiness and loss of

128
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,129
interest and pleasure in normal

129
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,199
activities whereas one men experience

130
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,460
depression they're much more likely to

131
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,740
have symptoms like the angry outbursts

132
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,360
and irritability and anxiety agitation

133
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,879
and restlessness and so because we don't

134
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,680
often associate those with depression

135
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
men are more likely to not even realize

136
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,500
that they're suffering from depression

137
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,789
another problem with the depression in

138
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,319
particular is that we tend to shame

139
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,449
people for feeling this way and a lot of

140
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:55,780
people with depression or often say that

141
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,220
they'll hear things like I can't believe

142
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,259
you are feeling sad when kids in Africa

143
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,319
are starving and there's a report to

144
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,520
this that does its rounds on the

145
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,870
internet every couple of months that I

146
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,250
think is really powerful that says

147
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,110
telling someone not to be sad because

148
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,490
others have it worse is like telling

149
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,780
people they can't be happy because

150
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,860
others have it better another really

151
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,229
great illustration of the stigma against

152
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,940
mental illness is from this webcomic

153
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,099
called robot hugs

154
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:22,449
it's called helpful advice and the

155
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,340
subtitle here is a physical illness were

156
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,960
treated like mental illness so just in

157
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,430
case you can't read the captions I'll

158
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,620
read them out loud on the left it says I

159
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,000
get that you have food poisoning at all

160
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,319
but you have to at least make an effort

161
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,930
on the right you just need to change

162
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,190
your frame of mind then you'll feel

163
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,440
better

164
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,030
have you tried you know not having the

165
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,729
flu I don't think it's healthy that you

166
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,259
have to take medication every day just

167
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:44,889
to feel normal

168
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,569
don't you worry that it's changing you

169
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,930
from who you really are it's like you're

170
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,770
not even trying

171
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,229
and while lying in bed obviously isn't

172
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,699
helping you you need to try something

173
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:58,360
else and all of the stigma and all of

174
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,740
the shame is a really big problem

175
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,020
because even in high-income countries

176
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,870
like Iceland and the United States

177
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,800
anywhere from thirty five to fifty

178
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,539
percent of people with mental disorders

179
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:10,020
do not receive any kind of treatment and

180
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,729
that's a problem because for example

181
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:14,830
with severe depression 15 percent of

182
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,550
people end up dying by suicide so when

183
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,719
the stakes are so high you would think

184
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,130
that people would speak up but the

185
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,560
reason they don't is because of fear

186
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,180
things like fear of dismissal fear of

187
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,289
being taken out of promotion

188
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:28,389
consideration fear of being taken off

189
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,460
high value projects and contracts fear

190
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,979
of reduced hours for hourly workers fear

191
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:34,210
of being asked to take unpaid medical

192
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,550
leave and just in general of fear being

193
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,279
treated differently and another problem

194
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,960
in the workplace and

195
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,759
in western countries is that we have

196
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,020
this idea of you should leave your

197
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,580
personal life at home when you come to

198
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,650
work but that doesn't work when you have

199
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,270
mental illness you can't just shut off

200
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,729
your depression for eight hours a day

201
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:53,349
come to work work productively and then

202
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:54,550
come home and deal with your depression

203
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,250
again for better or worse it's a part of

204
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,660
you and we have to do a better job of

205
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,250
accepting people as their whole selves

206
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,449
so now I'll talk a little bit about

207
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,130
myself and why I speak up about this and

208
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,050
I legitimately get asked this question a

209
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,639
lot because I am a software engineer

210
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,190
just like all of you I'm not a mental

211
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,810
health professional I've taken one

212
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,759
psychology class in my entire life I

213
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,030
actually went to art school twice I also

214
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,280
identify as mentally healthy and that

215
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
makes me a little bit unusual because

216
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,039
there are others who speak up about this

217
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,419
topic and they usually do so because

218
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:26,740
they are living with mental illness

219
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,070
themselves but the reason why I speak up

220
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,949
is because of her this is my best friend

221
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:34,840
me she and I met about seven years ago

222
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,520
when we were both living in New York

223
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,130
City at the time she had just moved

224
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,380
there from Seattle she had studied

225
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,389
biochemical and her parents really

226
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:45,340
wanted her to go to medical school but

227
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,750
she was interested in designing

228
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,190
technology and she convinced this

229
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,900
company to give her a web development

230
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,099
fellowship where she could basically

231
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,960
learn the tools of the job on the job so

232
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,780
she she and I headed off immediately he

233
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,120
became really close and she was doing

234
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,310
really well at work and after about a

235
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,659
year and a half in New York City she

236
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:06,699
realized that the next best thing that

237
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:09,099
she could do to advance her career was

238
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,810
to move to San Francisco and work at a

239
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,659
startup so obviously I was sad to see

240
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,919
her go but thanks to modern technology

241
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,349
we kept in touch and still talked all

242
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:20,199
the time but when she got to San

243
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,719
Francisco her imposter syndrome started

244
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,000
becoming more of a problem coming from

245
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,979
kind of a non-traditional background in

246
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,219
tech and that was an issue because she

247
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,630
had been living most of her adult life

248
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,050
with bipolar disorder but we thought she

249
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,209
was doing okay we thought she was doing

250
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:39,010
better and so it kind of took us all by

251
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,729
surprise when September 2 in September

252
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,480
2016 she took her own life so all of

253
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,800
this is still really difficult for me to

254
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,180
talk about so if you really want to know

255
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,820
more about this I wrote a very long blog

256
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,179
post about this on medium last year

257
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,589
but after all of this happened and after

258
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:57,910
I had a little bit of time to kind of

259
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,040
process this I realized that I really

260
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,899
wanted to turn my grief into action I

261
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,850
didn't want to just sit back and and

262
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,739
just continue to let this happen to

263
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:08,139
people like me and so I started

264
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:09,189
volunteering with this organization

265
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:10,809
called open sourcing mental illness

266
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,850
which was founded by this guy in the

267
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,910
right ed Fink ler he had been part of

268
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,920
the PHP conference speaker circuit for a

269
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,199
number of years and about four or five

270
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,600
years ago he started speaking up about

271
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,610
his own experiences living with

272
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,769
generalized anxiety disorder in ADHD and

273
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,179
how that affected his life as a

274
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:31,480
developer and his career in tech and his

275
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,100
talk actually resonated with a lot of

276
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,899
people and so they finally decided to

277
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,579
form a whole organization around it

278
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:38,860
which is now an official 501 C 3

279
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,319
non-profit in the United States called

280
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,299
open sourcing mental illness or Oh SMI

281
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:46,689
and so awareness campaigns are a really

282
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:48,759
big part of what OS mi does but we also

283
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,279
have a research arm we put out the

284
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,720
survey every year called the mental

285
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,769
health and tech survey where we

286
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,929
basically ask any and all of you who are

287
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,420
working in the tech industry to answer

288
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,829
these questions that allow us to gauge

289
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:01,720
what the attitudes are towards mental

290
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,990
health in tech and every year will

291
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,490
change up the questions a little bit but

292
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,769
there's always kind of a variation of

293
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:10,959
this one question which shows us that we

294
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,850
still have a lot of work to do it's

295
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,009
really to two variations of one question

296
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:16,600
it's do you think that discussing a

297
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,040
physical health issue with your employer

298
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,290
would have negative consequences and do

299
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,519
you think that discussing a mental

300
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,689
health issue with your employer would

301
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,879
have negative consequences and so you

302
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,529
can see on the left for the physical

303
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:29,559
health question the nose make up pretty

304
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,470
much 75% of all the responses but on the

305
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,730
right for the mental health questions

306
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,559
the esses and the maybes make up about

307
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,749
two-thirds of the pie that's a pretty

308
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:39,519
striking difference and shows that we

309
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,699
still have a lot of work to you so I've

310
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:45,069
been involved with OMI for almost a year

311
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:46,419
and a half now and I would say that my

312
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:48,129
biggest contribution in this community

313
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,869
as someone who is mentally healthy has

314
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:51,339
been to sit back and listen to people

315
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:54,249
like IDI tell their stories and to try

316
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:55,899
to empathize and think about what people

317
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,399
like me can do and there have been times

318
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,799
when that's legit illegitimate lis been

319
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,139
tough but there was a quote that Ed used

320
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,899
in one of his talks that I thought was

321
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,189
really powerful and that really kind of

322
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:06,860
opened my eye

323
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,660
- what how I really needed to approach

324
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,640
this which was I could do so many

325
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,390
awesome things

326
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,040
if only my own head didn't get in the

327
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,310
way and the first time I heard this I

328
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,480
just really stopped me in my tracks

329
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,700
because I realized my ability to do my

330
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,530
job as a software engineer rests solely

331
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,350
in my head I don't need muscles I'm not

332
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,180
a construction worker I really just get

333
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,650
to go to work every day and take for

334
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,120
granted that my brain is gonna do

335
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,490
everything that I tell it to do but

336
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,850
people like Edie can't do that and so I

337
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,740
started kind of thinking about you know

338
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,200
what if what if this is how I felt as I

339
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,030
went about my day how would that change

340
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,250
things or how much would my environment

341
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,500
have to change in order to accommodate

342
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,890
this better and so that kind of led me

343
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,080
down this path of thinking more about

344
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,050
what can the rest of us do and so they

345
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,400
got started with that I started just

346
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,080
kind of characterizing the tech industry

347
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,970
and thinking about what some of the the

348
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,380
unique kind of challenges and

349
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,750
characteristics are so things like the

350
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,070
work is challenging is stressful

351
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,410
our jobs are highly collaborative many

352
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,990
of us have relocated for a job most of

353
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,550
us work remotely at least part of the

354
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,770
time we're often expected to be

355
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,420
available outside work hours

356
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,160
someone needs to fix things when they

357
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,230
break overnight and there is a very hon

358
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,060
fit heavy emphasis on drinking culture

359
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,160
and so I started thinking about

360
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,500
relocation in particular because as I

361
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,030
had mentioned my friend knee had

362
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,450
relocated twice in order to work in tech

363
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,100
and one of her friends mentioned at the

364
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,380
funeral that she had mentioned to them

365
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,940
recently that she kind of regretted not

366
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,130
going back to Seattle where her family

367
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,560
was and so I was thinking about this a

368
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,360
lot and thinking you know it can't be

369
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,740
all bad there have to be legit

370
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,230
legitimate reasons why we really

371
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,150
relocate um so I just kind of started

372
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,440
approaching it from that angle of

373
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,700
thinking about like what are the pros

374
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,590
and cons so on the positive side it

375
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,240
makes that much easier to feel like

376
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,320
you're a part of the team and helping

377
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,760
towards the mission if you're on site

378
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,280
with everyone else or in these case it

379
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,750
can bring you closer to a community of

380
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,340
practitioners in your field compared to

381
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,280
where you currently are but on the

382
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,720
negative side it takes someone away from

383
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,100
the existing support structures that

384
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,780
they've already built up like the

385
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,100
therapists that they're seeing or the

386
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,140
friend whose house they can come to at

387
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,400
1:00 in the morning because you really

388
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,310
just need to have a good cry also moving

389
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,420
is generally always going to be

390
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,340
stressful and making new friends as an

391
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,649
adult is surprisingly hard

392
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:23,940
so I started thinking about solutions

393
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,730
and I promise I'm going to focus more on

394
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,920
pragmatic ones but this one this first

395
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,450
one is a little bit more aspirational

396
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,550
but I very strongly believe that as a

397
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,019
community we need to stop saying that

398
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,490
the best way to succeed in tech is to

399
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,560
relocate to Silicon Valley that may have

400
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,149
been true about 15 years ago but I think

401
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:40,920
things like remote work have come a long

402
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,170
way we need to become a lot more

403
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,620
accepting of alternative choices if you

404
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,120
are a manager take another look at your

405
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,399
hiring practices and see whether hiring

406
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,490
remote first employees is an option and

407
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,410
finally if that's not an option if

408
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,730
someone does have to relocate to join

409
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,980
your company make sure that you focus on

410
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,589
helping introduce that colleagues to

411
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:02,970
organizations and events in the area

412
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,220
after hours essentially ways for them to

413
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,480
start building up those support

414
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,350
structures again so I mentioned remote

415
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,700
work as a positive and I think in

416
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,130
general it is very positive for mental

417
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,390
health and people struggling with mental

418
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,149
illness for example it often leads to

419
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,970
more flexible hours and that in turn is

420
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,380
good because it makes it much easier to

421
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,480
attend daytime therapy appointments it

422
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,950
turns out that therapists like to work

423
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,720
9:00 to 5:00 Monday to Friday like all

424
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,610
of the rest of us so if you want to

425
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,839
start seeing a therapist you're going to

426
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,209
have to do that during the work day and

427
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,190
so a lot of people that I've talked to

428
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,350
have said working from home on the day

429
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,060
that you see your therapist it's just so

430
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,410
much easier because you can just kind of

431
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,930
duck out with everyone knowing that

432
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,750
you're going somewhere else for similar

433
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,160
reasons that can also make it easier to

434
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,680
stick to medication regimens it's often

435
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,779
easier to take breaks and in general

436
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,520
it's more quiet and peaceful than being

437
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,279
in the office but on the negative side

438
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,290
there is a sense of isolation that sits

439
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,180
in if especially if you're working from

440
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,740
home a hundred percent of the time and

441
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,230
I've had a couple of friends recently

442
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,790
who I've started working completely

443
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,620
remotely and it's always been

444
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,699
interesting because the first couple

445
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,170
months of this kind there's this kind of

446
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,149
honeymoon phase where like they're like

447
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,520
this is amazing how why have I not been

448
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,529
doing this my entire life I love working

449
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:19,140
in my pajamas this is great but then

450
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,240
after about two months that honeymoon

451
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,130
phase kind of wears off and the sense of

452
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,320
isolation sets in and they start

453
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,760
complaining that they're feeling lonely

454
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,050
they're missing the watercooler

455
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,240
conversations the connections with their

456
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,710
their colleagues etc and along those

457
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,750
Lions in general working remotely can

458
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,800
make it harder to build strong

459
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,030
relationships with your co-workers

460
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,010
especially if you're the only one who's

461
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,810
remote and everyone else is on site

462
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,850
together and even if you're not

463
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,200
struggling with mental illness but you

464
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,610
just want to be a good supportive

465
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,170
colleague it can make it harder to tell

466
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,000
if everyone's doing okay if you're

467
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,980
mostly just communicating by slack and

468
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,800
the occasional Skype call and it can

469
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,060
also make it challenging to maintain a

470
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,530
work-life balance especially if you're

471
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,360
truly working from home and your home is

472
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,520
your office I've heard from a lot of

473
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,020
people that they just have difficulty

474
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,520
saying okay it's five o'clock I'm not

475
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,350
gonna respond to work emails and slack

476
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,820
anymore so some of the solutions

477
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,440
co-working spaces I think are excellent

478
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,100
and really undervalued and I think one

479
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,480
of the biggest barriers to people trying

480
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,950
it out is that there is often an

481
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,960
initiation fee or a monthly fee that you

482
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,390
have to pay so a good solution for this

483
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,280
is to have the company at the very least

484
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,870
pay for the first month so that that

485
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,550
person will be more likely to try it and

486
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,650
see if it's for them and to be clear

487
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,880
this is not something that you have to

488
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,230
do every day I've heard from a lot of

489
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,730
people that even if they just go into a

490
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,070
co-working space once a week it's still

491
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,450
helpful and makes them feel less

492
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,910
isolated

493
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,680
also make sure you occasionally fly in

494
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,390
remote employees or hold company-wide

495
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,800
off sites to make sure like everyone

496
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,480
feels like they're part of the team and

497
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,850
they're getting a chance to bond

498
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,980
and finally there's just so much

499
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,690
research happening around remote work

500
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,400
culture and how to make it better that

501
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,050
there's so many resources that you can

502
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,670
leverage there's whole conferences

503
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,130
around this now so just look into kind

504
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,690
of what the latest kind of state of the

505
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,940
art around remote work is try some

506
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,320
things with your team if you find that

507
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,690
you're still struggling and see if it

508
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,010
works for you and if not try something

509
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,510
else there's there's just so many things

510
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,950
to try so the first time that I was

511
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,480
going to give this talk one of the

512
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,860
things that surprised me the most was

513
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,959
someone came back and said so what about

514
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,580
open-plan offices what are you planning

515
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,890
to say about that and I actually had not

516
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,860
planned on saying anything at all but so

517
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,690
I figured okay this is a good question

518
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,360
so let me do some research so on the

519
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,310
positive side they are more conducive to

520
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,230
collaboration kratom creative

521
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,550
problem-solving between multiple

522
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,620
employees people having more organic

523
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,420
conversations that lead to solutions

524
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,560
that no one had thought of on their own

525
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,840
etc I used to think that that's why

526
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,400
everyone did it but it turns out that

527
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,390
it's actually

528
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,710
because it's just easier to construct

529
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,360
offices that way because of things like

530
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,590
building fire codes it could also can

531
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,330
increase a sense of team unity or

532
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,950
camaraderie but I really want to

533
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,330
emphasize the can here because if

534
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,800
there's already friction on the team

535
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,060
then it can actually increase it

536
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,600
resentment instead but on the negative

537
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,890
side the number one complaint about

538
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,900
open-plan offices is the noise and how

539
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,930
it reduces productivity from a mental

540
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,580
health perspective I think the biggest

541
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,800
concern is the lack of privacy when I

542
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,900
talked about remote work before when I

543
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,670
said you know working from home makes it

544
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,620
easier to duck out in the afternoon for

545
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,840
your like therapy appointments this is

546
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,400
kind of the exact opposite right you're

547
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,860
working very closely with everyone so if

548
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,180
you need to duck out for the therapy

549
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,440
appointment everyone's going to know

550
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,410
about it people also have cited an

551
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,510
increased sense of stress and there's

552
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,940
also increased peer pressure and this is

553
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,770
a problem for mental health because I

554
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,630
think it's quite off it happens quite

555
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,040
often to us as developers where

556
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,900
sometimes we just get stuck and we

557
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,400
realized that the absolute best thing

558
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,470
that we can do for ourselves is just to

559
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,210
take a break for maybe like 20 minutes

560
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,010
go take a walk around the block do

561
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,140
something completely different but what

562
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,000
often happens in open-plan offices is

563
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,440
you look around and everyone else has

564
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,940
bent over their desks and they look

565
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,070
productive and what happens in that case

566
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,720
is you talk yourself out of taking that

567
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,000
break and that's actually the worst

568
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,440
possible thing that you can do for

569
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,320
yourself in that moment and finally

570
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,600
open-plan offices are are also highly

571
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,130
conducive to the spread of physical

572
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,820
disease like the cold the flu etc so

573
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,950
again I'm focusing on pragmatic

574
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,540
solutions so I love to come up here and

575
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,070
say we should not have open-plan offices

576
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,290
anymore but I think the vast majority of

577
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,120
us are not in the position to make that

578
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,210
call so then the next easiest and best

579
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,220
thing to do is to make sure that

580
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,680
everyone is allowed to work remotely or

581
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,960
if they are already maybe increase the

582
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,100
number of days per week or per month

583
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,250
when they can do so also regardless

584
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,900
always urge your employees to work from

585
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,700
home when they're sick don't have them

586
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,110
bring the cold or the flu into the

587
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,350
office maybe try setting aside small

588
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,900
meeting spaces for quiet work I work in

589
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,240
a pretty big office and I think for

590
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
those of us with big offices one thing

591
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,510
that happens is there's always that one

592
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,980
conference room that's actually too

593
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,560
small to have a productive meeting in so

594
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,470
maybe just that

595
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,929
one aside for people to check out for

596
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,429
like an hour if they realize that they

597
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:08,260
just need a bit of quiet time in the

598
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,640
afternoon where they can get some

599
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,380
productive work done also have the

600
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,340
company provide noise cancelling

601
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,870
headphones this is often the easiest

602
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,760
solution that everyone turns to first

603
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,950
and it does work pretty effectively and

604
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,630
then finally encourage employees to

605
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,309
decorate their workspace and this might

606
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:26,010
sound on the surface like it has nothing

607
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,490
to do with improving offices and

608
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,470
productivity at all but the research has

609
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,950
actually says the out the opposite

610
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,809
there was a 2014 study done in Sweden

611
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:39,580
where they tested out different office

612
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,220
configurations and they had their the

613
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,690
people who worked in them basically rate

614
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,190
how these office configurations made

615
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,380
them feel and the one that was rated the

616
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,390
worst interestingly enough especially

617
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,270
among men was the open-plan Flex office

618
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,830
which is an open plan office where no

619
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,350
one has their own desk and there was a

620
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,270
2010 study done that was done in the UK

621
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,740
where they compared people who had

622
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,510
decorated and personalized the workspace

623
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,860
and people who hadn't and they found

624
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,390
that the people who had decorated their

625
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,980
workspaces were actually one-third more

626
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,380
productive so as silly as it sounds

627
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,490
these life hacks actually work and then

628
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,860
alcohol tech events so this is kind of a

629
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,380
controversial one but let me go through

630
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,850
the kind of positives and negatives

631
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,520
first so one or two drinks can make it

632
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,020
easier for some introverts and those

633
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,580
with social anxiety to socialize with

634
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,049
their peers and I'm guilty of this

635
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:29,200
myself and the next one is a bit of a

636
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,850
positive negative but if you don't offer

637
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,409
alcohol than those who want to drink

638
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:34,360
will go to a bar instead of staying to

639
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,429
mingle with others at your event so

640
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,049
conferences like this one that's often

641
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:39,370
the reason why they say they have

642
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,049
alcohol they want everyone to stay here

643
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,900
and and kind of socialize and network

644
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,770
because that's the whole point of why

645
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,090
we're doing we're having conferences

646
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,840
like this but on the negative side it

647
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,549
makes non-drinkers feel unwelcome in

648
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:54,400
general and if you're a recovering

649
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,350
alcoholic then you're definitely going

650
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,789
to feel threatened by the kind of event

651
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:00,370
where alcohol is flowing three flowing

652
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,450
freely and to be clear alcoholism is

653
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,039
substance use disorder is a mental

654
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:09,130
illness and in general Frio alcoholic

655
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,750
drinking culture are so pervasive that

656
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,980
they're probably more functioning

657
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,760
alcoholics and tectum were even aware of

658
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,060
so some of the solutions i personnaly a

659
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,290
mountain of dual saying no one should

660
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,850
ever have alcohol attack events again I

661
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,520
think there's like intermediate steps

662
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,170
that we can try in the meantime one

663
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,300
thing that some places have tried that

664
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,800
actually work pretty well are for

665
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,940
example making sure that you always

666
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,430
offer nice alternatives things like the

667
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,750
fancy sodas that come in the glass

668
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,240
bottles or even mocktails to make sure

669
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,560
that nong drinkers feel like they're

670
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,570
included I've heard from several non

671
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,280
drinkers that often the biggest insult

672
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,470
to them is to get to the after-party and

673
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,300
everyone else is getting like customized

674
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,860
cocktails and they just get some like

675
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,320
lukewarm sodas where they have to like

676
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,810
fill their own ice so make sure that

677
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,210
you're treating everyone equally also

678
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,860
put a limit on the number of free drinks

679
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,120
that you give out use some kind of

680
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,310
ticket or token system and people

681
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,990
usually do this for budget reasons but

682
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,370
it ends up working out well for health

683
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,690
reasons as well because the way it

684
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,490
usually works is you'll get like two

685
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,680
free drink tickets and after that it

686
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,080
turns into a cash bar but what that

687
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,610
leads to is someone will have their two

688
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,200
free drinks and they'll be thinking

689
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,610
about do I want to take out my wallet to

690
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,860
pay for that third drink and what often

691
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,300
happens then is that they'll realize

692
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,160
actually I have a pretty good buzz going

693
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,870
and maybe I don't need that third drink

694
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,030
so then they're not getting drunk and

695
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,380
you don't have to deal with those kinds

696
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,220
of health consequences also always make

697
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,840
sure that you have activities other than

698
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,820
drinking it turns out that there's a

699
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,190
pretty big overlap between developers

700
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,530
and people who like playing board games

701
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,910
so you would think that more tech events

702
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,140
would have things like a board game

703
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,290
night if you're having a recurring

704
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,060
series of events like a weekly company

705
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,310
happy hour or a monthly meetup maybe

706
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,410
just try alternating dry and written on

707
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,330
dry events so don't cut out the alcohol

708
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,920
completely but you don't have to do it

709
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,410
every single time

710
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,940
and then finally add workplace wellness

711
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,880
programs on substance abuse I think

712
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,200
these are the kind of thing where most

713
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,120
of us will roll our eyes at them when

714
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,040
they happen but research has shown that

715
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,440
they're actually relatively effective it

716
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,000
turns out that most of us just need that

717
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,010
periodic reminder that there are serious

718
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,860
consequences to drinking too much and

719
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,990
that reinforcement is just very helpful

720
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,550
for managers and tech leads and senior

721
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,500
devs I think overall the biggest piece

722
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,660
of advice is just to lead by example on

723
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,120
things like not micromanaging leaving

724
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,750
the office on

725
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,670
I'm taking regular vacations yourself

726
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,010
not sending our answering emails at 2:00

727
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,470
a.m. if possible being receptive to

728
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,940
feedback on your own performance in

729
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,740
addition giving people feedback on their

730
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,360
performance and being a good listener

731
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,950
and really the only thing that I would

732
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,780
say that's kind of unique to to mental

733
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,460
health is that you should try to be more

734
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,410
open to talking about your own health or

735
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,330
mental health or maybe something that

736
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,640
happened in your family because it turns

737
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,800
out that really your number-one goal

738
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,440
should be for your employees or your

739
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,450
reports to come to you and say hey look

740
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,010
I'm struggling with this issue I might

741
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,440
need an accommodation that sort of thing

742
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,960
but people are not gonna do that if you

743
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,860
haven't been a little bit more

744
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,540
vulnerable and open about some things

745
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,090
that you yourself have struggled with so

746
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,920
it sounds really counterintuitive I feel

747
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,450
like most of us by the time that we get

748
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,950
to like that senior level we feel like

749
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,280
we should be like completely invincible

750
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,290
but actually being vulnerable is

751
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,920
probably one of your best assets some

752
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,380
other action items for managers make

753
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,610
sure your employees understand their

754
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,690
benefits and what mental health

755
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,390
treatments are covered revisit your

756
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,040
hiring practices with an eye to mental

757
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,540
illness and neurodiversity and I'll talk

758
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,030
more about neurodiversity in a minute

759
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,550
make sure employees feel valued in our

760
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,990
own projects that they find fulfilling

761
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,360
and empowering and this might sound on

762
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,740
the surface like it has nothing at all

763
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,120
to do with mental health but I would say

764
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,920
like this is the single biggest takeaway

765
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,110
for me and my time with osm eye and

766
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,280
listening to other people tell their

767
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,110
stories is that I've noticed a trend

768
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,700
that when people are saying like I feel

769
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,830
like my depression is starting to come

770
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,210
back I feel like my symptoms are getting

771
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,760
worse it's often accompanied by change

772
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,890
at work at work so they got put on a

773
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,870
different project they feel like they're

774
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,250
not getting as many opportunities to

775
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,710
give feedback or make changes in the

776
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,590
process the management is just not being

777
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,180
transparent about why they're doing this

778
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,390
etc etc so making sure people that

779
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,880
making sure people feel valued and are

780
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,320
feeling fulfilled is actually really

781
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,920
important for mental wellness as well

782
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,140
get the oh so my handbooks they are on

783
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,520
the OS and my website but you can also

784
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,310
get them directly from lean pub two of

785
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,980
them deal with the Americans with

786
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,720
Disabilities Act so they're probably

787
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,700
only relevant if you're in the US but

788
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,230
the third one talks about how to start a

789
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,730
mental wellness program in your

790
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,440
workplace and that would be a great one

791
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,820
for everyone here to check

792
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,220
and then finally consider offering the

793
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,130
Mental Health First Aid training so

794
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,510
Mental Health First Aid is this

795
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,130
international program that was started

796
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:56,270
in Australia and is available in all of

797
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,310
these countries in Europe the US and

798
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,290
Canada I believe in India and Nepal as

799
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:04,100
well it's either 8 hours or 12 hours and

800
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,690
the whole focus of it is to basically

801
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,220
teach you how to respond if you

802
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,930
encounter someone having a mental health

803
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,240
crisis and I've heard from many people

804
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,490
that they they found it very useful as a

805
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,980
sort of empathy training essentially as

806
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,340
well so if you're trying to find sort of

807
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,080
the most effective way to really truly

808
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,380
get everyone to to respond to mental

809
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,150
health better in your company this is

810
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,670
probably the best thing that you can do

811
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:31,580
and can sometimes be challenging to

812
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,990
actually attend the training there

813
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,610
they're often kind of limited and where

814
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,530
and when they're given if you're based

815
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,390
in Iceland obviously it's not even one

816
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,650
of the countries on the list but what

817
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,080
you can do is actually bring in a

818
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,450
trainer to give the training on-site and

819
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,950
that's a great way it's often even

820
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,720
cheaper than just having one person

821
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,000
attend the training by themselves so

822
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,170
that's a great way to make sure that all

823
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,880
of your employees get trained or

824
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,620
everyone on the management team got

825
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,330
trained etc so finally I'll spend just a

826
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,130
couple of minutes talking about the

827
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,480
stuff that we all have to do together

828
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,970
where everyone has to do their part the

829
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,350
first really big thing is making sure

830
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,370
that we're always supporting

831
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,100
marginalized people in the tech industry

832
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,450
and this is important because chronic

833
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,370
harassment bullying and microaggressions

834
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,950
can lead to depression exacerbate eating

835
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,360
disorders and cause or worsen

836
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,700
other mental illnesses and people are

837
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,470
often surprised when I mentioned eating

838
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,120
disorders in the context of tech they're

839
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,130
like well we're not models we're not

840
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,160
actresses how why does it matter how you

841
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,260
look but it turns out that even in tech

842
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,490
women are still judged by their

843
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,670
appearance in sort of the Silicon Valley

844
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,350
startup culture in particular I've heard

845
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,360
a lot of stories about women being told

846
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,680
things like oh you only got this

847
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,720
interview because you're pretty and so

848
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,160
if you're already suffering with issues

849
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,650
of body image and eating disorders this

850
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,590
is just gonna make it worse and in

851
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,030
general people from marginalized groups

852
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,800
often feel like they have to over

853
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,540
perform because there's this whole myth

854
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,460
of the bar having to be lowered in order

855
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,810
to allow them into tech in the first

856
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,440
place

857
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
and so that over-performing leads to

858
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,950
increased stress and a much greater

859
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,210
likelihood of burnout we also need to

860
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,220
fully embrace neuro diversity so neuro

861
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,810
diversity is this idea that mental

862
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,880
disorders like ADHD and autism in

863
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,800
particular are the result of natural

864
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,560
variations of the human genome they said

865
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,670
that people with these kinds of

866
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,260
differences do not need to be cured they

867
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,230
need help and accommodation instead so

868
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,030
to be clear the strongest proponents of

869
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,920
neuro diversity say that we should

870
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,660
actually stop looking for a cure for

871
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,450
autism altogether I think that's a

872
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,830
little bit controversial and I think

873
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,390
it's probably worth it to keep looking

874
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,460
for a cure for autism but I also

875
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,500
recognize that even if we do find a cure

876
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,630
it's probably only going to help the

877
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,920
people who aren't born yet

878
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,840
chances are it's not going to help

879
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,400
anyone who is living with autism right

880
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,140
now which means there are multiple

881
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,180
generations of people with autism who

882
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,460
deserve to live healthy happy productive

883
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,050
lives and be contributing members to

884
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,600
society and it's in our own interest as

885
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,680
well because some of our greatest

886
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,780
inventions are treated to people with

887
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,660
atypical neurology at Sinclair himself

888
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,010
has this quote he likes to use in his

889
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,600
talks where he says mental illness gives

890
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,240
me super powers he talks about how his

891
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,280
ADHD in particular allows him to make

892
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,960
connections faster than a lot of other

893
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,690
people and understand whole systems see

894
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,860
solutions that they hadn't thought of

895
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,340
before

896
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,290
and there was this article in the

897
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,910
Harvard Business Review from last May

898
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,830
called neurodiversity as a competitive

899
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,690
advantage where they actually found the

900
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,390
same thing they found that people with

901
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,100
autism who are working at companies like

902
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,230
IBM and hewlett-packard were actually

903
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,430
incredibly productive thinking of

904
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,830
solutions no what a thought of etc and

905
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,180
the biggest barrier was actually

906
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,800
bringing them into the companies in the

907
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,420
first place they had to essentially

908
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,160
change up their interview process to

909
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,960
allow these people to enter these kinds

910
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,820
of companies and so finally some of the

911
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,290
things we can only change as a culture

912
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,390
the whole idea of working ourselves to

913
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,550
death the over emphasis on hard work and

914
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,420
stigma against vacation and things like

915
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,880
the best programmers always code on the

916
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,850
holidays that kind of idea the need to

917
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,470
always be available by phone or email

918
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,680
I go to Iceland to speak at a conference

919
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,510
like this and I always feel pressured to

920
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,190
tell everyone how to reach me in case of

921
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,850
an emergency

922
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,679
and that shouldn't need to be the case

923
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:15,080
the peer pressure caused by social media

924
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,070
there have been some studies done

925
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,779
recently about Facebook in particular

926
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:20,179
and they found that people suffering

927
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,000
from depression struggle with using

928
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,590
Facebook because everyone just posts

929
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,880
about the good things that happen in

930
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,250
their lives and so seeing everyone else

931
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,590
seemingly happy with their weddings and

932
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,940
their babies that cetera just makes them

933
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,559
feel worse and even more down on

934
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,350
themselves I mentioned this before but

935
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,909
the belief that you must be in Silicon

936
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:39,590
Valley to succeed I don't think that's

937
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,210
true and 2018 anymore

938
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,980
the stigma against talking about our

939
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,659
feelings and finally the idea that

940
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:47,539
engineers don't have empathy and this

941
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,429
was kind of a new thing for me maybe

942
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:51,259
because I went to art school but I was

943
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:53,090
talking to a woman who had started her

944
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,830
own business and she was saying that she

945
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,659
brought in this consultant who said you

946
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:58,100
can never use the word empathy around

947
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,299
your end engineers because they all

948
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:02,000
believe that they don't have it and so

949
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,289
that was incredibly strange to me

950
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,240
because empathy is something that we all

951
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,980
have the capacity for we just have to

952
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,440
choose to exercise it and there was a

953
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,210
quote that the same woman used in a talk

954
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,639
that she gave that I thought was really

955
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:15,470
powerful that was empathy is the

956
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,809
antidote to shame and she actually

957
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:19,309
mentioned this in the context of the

958
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:20,960
shame and blame culture of tech but I

959
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,429
think it's very true for mental illness

960
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:24,379
as well where the shame here really is

961
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:26,269
the stigma against mental illness and so

962
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:29,000
empathy is the antidote and that all

963
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,470
brings me back to you the title of my

964
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,000
talk empathy as a service

965
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,440
hopefully you figured out by now that

966
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080
this is kind of in jest there is no app

967
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,799
for this

968
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,659
we can't deploy it to the cloud we can't

969
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,700
automate it away this is something that

970
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,470
we all have the capacity for and we have

971
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,169
to choose to exercise it as a service to

972
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:47,389
each other and if you're struggling with

973
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:49,460
how to do this I just bring you back to

974
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,409
the quote from Ed's talk that really

975
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:53,360
helped me which was I could do so many

976
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,679
awesome things if only my own head

977
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:57,649
didn't get in the way and so I have a

978
00:32:57,649 --> 00:32:59,299
list of resources that will be in my

979
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:00,620
slides I'm not going to go through these

980
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,509
but feel free to ask me if you want to

981
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:03,830
know more about what any of these are

982
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,220
for and feel free to reach out any time

983
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,710
with thoughts questions etc I mean I

984
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,750
always told people like even if like six

985
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,370
months from now you're like man I really

986
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,679

988
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,570
