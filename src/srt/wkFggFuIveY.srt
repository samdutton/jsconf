10
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:26,289
thank you

11
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,210
so it's today I wanted to share with you

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,219
the unlock the power a feature based

13
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:34,329
JavaScript development my email is Jeff

14
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,969
at code winds my handle there is Jeff be

15
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:40,030
ski on Twitter and github and then the

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,829
slides will be available or they are

17
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:44,970
available at code winds calm /j s kampf

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,710
2018 so you can get all the slides and

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:53,620
notes so have you ever entered into some

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,380
code base and then looking around in it

21
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,720
and you're like what is all this doing

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,930
and why is it here and you look at some

23
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,890
of the comments and it doesn't help and

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,180
you know eventually you get you get

25
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,229
looking through and you just like this

26
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,299
is just like you know some complicated

27
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:11,469
mousetrap or something you know it

28
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:12,610
doesn't make any sense why all this

29
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,430
stuff's here and then you do a get blame

30
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,530
on it to find out who did it and you

31
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,940
realize you know it was you you know

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,870
anybody anything happen to anybody

33
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,150
before I think Michael Chan said that

34
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,790
you know code that you've written six

35
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,150
months ago is uh is often code you don't

36
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,010
like anymore so you know it's it doesn't

37
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,690
have a you know you always learn more

38
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,690
things and new things and well that's

39
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,640
happened to me before

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,909
Who am I married I've got a one grown

41
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:45,640
daughter active in our Catholic parish

42
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,780
and been active in JavaScript wrote of

43
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,970
past seven years I got some open source

44
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,009
projects oh it's cutting off on me into

45
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,030
Dario see there you go so I started a

46
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,290
small company code winds so I do

47
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,150
training and consulting so if you need

48
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,580
any help on any of these things I'd love

49
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,640
to help you with your project

50
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,370
so why feature-based development what

51
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,349
what are we talking about well software

52
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,840
is is is complex and you know there's

53
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,939
always more things to keep getting added

54
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,819
to it and so it's you know it's

55
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,290
something that's always getting more

56
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,460
complicated

57
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,550
you know we've learned to start out and

58
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,830
do like MVPs you know so we can try to

59
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,210
get something out to the customer so

60
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,910
they can see it quicker and those things

61
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,130
have kind of you know evolve how we do

62
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,990
software you used to try to plan out

63
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,240
every possible thing up front and you

64
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,620
know you never even get started you know

65
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,360
the project takes years to be for you

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,580
all the planning so now we're at least

67
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,120
delivering you know value sooner and so

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,980
with Sprint's and trying to evolve the

69
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,920
code so we've tried to do this feature

70
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,770
base stuff before you a lot of times we

71
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,600
use git commits you know and branches to

72
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,270
try and put whole features together and

73
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,960
move them in a merge at a time and we

74
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,010
and the other thing we try to do is

75
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,720
organize by feature so a lot of times

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,130
you'll see people trying to organize

77
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,560
their code base so that all the things

78
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,470
around a particular domain or portion of

79
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,950
the screen are all handled in one area a

80
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,840
lot of times you've with feet you know

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,670
features you want to do a/b testing so

82
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,290
you'll want to turn on a new feature or

83
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,090
you want to change a feature to a new

84
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,700
new version so sometimes you might have

85
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,200
feature switches where you want people

86
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,390
to be able to do that early adopters

87
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,280
might you know be able to try some of

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,240
your new code app so what are the

89
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,830
challenges with with feature base 2

90
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,500
element well sometimes maintaining

91
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,930
flexibility so we start to get too rigid

92
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,480
and we can't use new technology we can't

93
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,470
it would get locked into certain

94
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,460
frameworks so that can be a problem

95
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,990
wiring and boilerplate sometimes it's

96
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,660
just a mess to try and code this stuff

97
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,340
up so it even you know hooks together so

98
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,970
it's a lot of work sharing across

99
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,220
features can be challenging as far as

100
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,440
trying to keep things isolated but yet

101
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,590
still be able to share things and then

102
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,120
also to be able to fire things off at

103
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,530
the right time so sometimes things need

104
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,330
to happen in order and different things

105
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,550
like that so hooks and dependencies are

106
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,890
challenges so some previous things that

107
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,090
you could have done to try and do

108
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,980
feature based development or you could

109
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,200
have like I said mention are used pull

110
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,150
requests and do emerge things together

111
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,160
but you know sometimes you you get

112
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,290
through the development of the branch in

113
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,440
the feature and then it gets held up you

114
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,180
know maybe it's waiting for something

115
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,300
else to be done

116
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,210
or people want to review it again or you

117
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,409
know those guys are busy on something

118
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,690
else and so sometimes things don't line

119
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,940
up and then you know things get merged

120
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,440
out of order and it's just it's a mess

121
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,909
you know it can be really challenging to

122
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:53,180
try and move the code together it's hard

123
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,979
to it's hard to a/b test to if you if

124
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,360
these features are developed you know

125
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,190
where they be replace each other you

126
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,569
know with the commits then there's no

127
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,220
way to go back or you know in all that

128
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,889
so it's it could be tricky

129
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,360
so there's some boilerplate projects

130
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,220
that try to you know kind of take this

131
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,190
idea of adding features at a time until

132
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,930
they leave include like a CLI where you

133
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,150
can you know generate some code that's

134
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,389
already hooked up you know so that helps

135
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:20,030
it can work but you know you're kind of

136
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,069
locked into whatever they have you know

137
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:23,270
what if you know hopefully it's an

138
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,500
active community and they're still

139
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,270
developing it and you know upgrading it

140
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,340
but you kind of are stuck you know if

141
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,440
they're using the specific technology or

142
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,449
you're kind of locked into that so it

143
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,099
can be pretty you know and so it can

144
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,690
over time it can get stale especially if

145
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,780
they move on to other things so the

146
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,430
dependency injection frameworks you know

147
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,900
there's probably a thousand different

148
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,590
ones out in MPM a lot of them are kind

149
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,150
of complicated and they do all kinds of

150
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,250
different things but from what I've seen

151
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,960
I haven't really seen any that really

152
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,110
fit this feature-based development

153
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,139
process very well you could just take a

154
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,819
global object and start throwing stuff

155
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:01,580
on that but you know there's you can

156
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,080
obviously have collisions name

157
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,690
collisions and things so that you don't

158
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,370
know you know there's no protection

159
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,409
against overwriting something else and

160
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,990
no use it's contracts and stuff like

161
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,340
that so there's there challenges with

162
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,430
doing that kind of a template so that

163
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,710
leads me to feature you so this is a

164
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,379
library that Kevin Bridges wrote one of

165
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:23,539
my good friends I worked with Kevin for

166
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,430
about eight years of our GA in st. Louis

167
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,539
and Kevin's just he's an inspiring guy

168
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,139
to me he's he's had the long career you

169
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,539
know and and I know I've went through my

170
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,129
career ups and downs and got burned out

171
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,710
a few times and fired back up and Kevin

172
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,879
just seems like he's just one little

173
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,469
solid guys that just you know plows on

174
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,009
through creates beautiful software great

175
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,940
documentation and so he was working on a

176
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,900
react native an expo project

177
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,990
and he got the idea well if he could try

178
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,320
and extract this feature you based

179
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,890
approach from his existing project he

180
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,480
started to see some similarities and how

181
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,180
things might be able to pull doubt be

182
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,850
pulled out from his app and so that's

183
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,140
how future you kind of came about he

184
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,660
started from that idea so this is you

185
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,550
know primarily for a reactor a react

186
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,860
native or Expo type app but I think the

187
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,780
ideas are good and I think you know it

188
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,310
could easily be applied to a lot of

189
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,020
different frameworks and that so it's

190
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,780
really more Universal Nass so the

191
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,350
project is at feature UJS org and his

192
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,570
github is there with Kevin ast so what

193
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,390
are the benefits of feature you

194
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,620
well it's designed for feature

195
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,510
development I mean he it's that's what

196
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,820
he built it for it's simple and flexible

197
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,170
it doesn't have a lot of those

198
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,250
complicated things that the DI

199
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,280
frameworks have it makes it easy for

200
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,800
cross feature sharing it makes it easy

201
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,750
to capsulate things into into specific

202
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,170
features organizing by feature testing a

203
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,470
and B test a and B testing and it's

204
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,270
dramatically it reduces your boilerplate

205
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,680
and wiring out when I saw how little

206
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,720
wiring you have to do once you start

207
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,550
using this I was like wow this is this

208
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,930
is good I mean this is good just even

209
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,940
from you know non-feature development if

210
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,790
you wanted to get get up and going you

211
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,410
know it just really dramatically reduces

212
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,240
that wiring

213
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,620
he's also got lifecycle hooks where

214
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,600
things will fire off at the right time

215
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,630
so you can build that into your features

216
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,490
he has this the concept of aspects where

217
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,040
you can extend with new technology so

218
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,260
this can just be added in and all of a

219
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,580
sudden now you have a new technology

220
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,070
that's that's being used and he's got

221
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,810
really good validation across all this

222
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,690
and usage contracts so one of these

223
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,920
things that's kind of difficult with

224
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,890
with defining stuff across dependencies

225
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,480
an app is to make sure you've got all

226
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,130
the things accounted for so if you're

227
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,410
expecting a widget over here to come

228
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,450
through you got your you want a widget

229
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,710
come to come through over here you want

230
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,210
to make sure it's it's matching up you

231
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,680
spell everything right you know it's all

232
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,900
hooked up and you want to know quickly

233
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,990
if it's if it hasn't so a high-level

234
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,080
overview how this works we create and

235
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,550
register features so

236
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,019
that's the kind of the main main part of

237
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,450
it you can instantiate and register

238
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,250
certain aspects if you need them so

239
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,000
things like Redux or Redux logic or he's

240
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,920
got a built-in feature router that works

241
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,029
well with with react native then you

242
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,350
launch the app with the features and

243
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,600
assets it actually has a hook where you

244
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,370
just define what it's going to do when

245
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,190
it launches and it takes care of it it

246
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,769
does all the heavy work of wiring things

247
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:34,470
up and Verret validating and then

248
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,630
features themselves can define what he

249
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,870
calls facets or feature asset and that's

250
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,000
there for cross cross feature sharing so

251
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,079
that's I'll show you a little bit more

252
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:44,910
about that and features will basically

253
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,500
define them and other features will use

254
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,970
them so then that way that's how you get

255
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,870
the cross sharing and feature you can it

256
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,310
can help manage and validate those paths

257
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,839
so like I said it if you define the

258
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,640
contracts it'll actually make sure that

259
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,290
they exist and are spelled right and all

260
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,380
that so I don't don't know if you can

261
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,269
read this chart very well but you can

262
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,310
look at the slides later and it kind of

263
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,510
just summarizes what I was talking about

264
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,709
we got a bunch of different features

265
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,200
that make up your app launch app brings

266
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,930
it all together it exposes it pulls all

267
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,089
the facets that are defined across all

268
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,709
the features pulls it together into an

269
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:21,940
object and gives it to your to your app

270
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,779
so here's a just example of kind of the

271
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,070
structure you might use and you could

272
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,510
really use whatever structure you want

273
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,490
but this seemed to work pretty well with

274
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,140
feature based development and so you

275
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,180
basically would have you know an index

276
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,220
file that kicks everything off calls the

277
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,720
launch app pulls together the features

278
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,730
and all that and then I like to have

279
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,649
like a features directory and in each

280
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,290
directory in the index that accumulates

281
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,270
all of them and then in different

282
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,860
directories for each feature so then and

283
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,839
that might just be an index file or it

284
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,970
could be an index and actions file and a

285
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,230
producer file and you know you could

286
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,970
split it up however you want components

287
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,560
you know everything everything that's

288
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,880
related to that feature can all live

289
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,630
together right there and at one one spot

290
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,649
so this feature object is a kind of a

291
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,440
key concept so you basically call create

292
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,600
feature you give it a unique name and

293
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,970
this will and if you name it the same

294
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,040
thing it'll complain got validation and

295
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,329
make sure you know each features got a

296
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,459
unique name

297
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,050
he's got an optional flag for if it's

298
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,010
enabled or not so you can actually

299
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,079
toggle this on and off with logic you

300
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,680
know if you wanted and then the facets

301
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,029
part that's where you actually would

302
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,389
define and use facets so you can

303
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:35,130
actually define what you assets that you

304
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,110
provide from your feature and ask that

305
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,449
you want to use in this case then it

306
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,550
would validate that those those assets

307
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,949
those facets live or exist somewhere

308
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:48,089
that they're created and then in this

309
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:51,690
case if we're using redux then there

310
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,310
might be a reducer that's associated

311
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,440
with it and if using Redux logic then

312
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,959
you might have a logic array if it comes

313
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,980
with it and then some optional callbacks

314
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,290
app will start and an app did start and

315
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,690
it provides you hook then where you can

316
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,810
provide what what the you know the app

317
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,100
was gonna start up with with the

318
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,350
component and also you know fire off

319
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,300
other things later so it gives you those

320
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,260
nice hooks and I mentioned in the

321
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,630
feature directory I had like an index

322
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,760
file and in there I basically import all

323
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,350
the features that I'm that I have and

324
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,709
then export them as a array and so this

325
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,329
will be the actually the arrays the

326
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,640
array of features that gets used by our

327
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,480
launch app and so here's launch app and

328
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,180
this was in the source index file so we

329
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,949
might have a couple aspects that I've

330
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:42,630
created here I've used in Redux Redux

331
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,790
logic if you don't have any then those

332
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,310
will be you know just the empty array I

333
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,839
got my features coming in from source in

334
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,910
our source feature index and then

335
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,940
basically called register root app and

336
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,320
kind of whatever code I need to do so

337
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,600
for web app react app then you would

338
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,540
call react Dom render for an expo app

339
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,480
you call expo dot register root element

340
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,269
and you know whatever whatever at you

341
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,339
need to do for your startup so this

342
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,329
would work with many you know many

343
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:13,440
different types of systems so features

344
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,180
aspects register facets kind of context

345
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,819
so this cross feature sharing usage

346
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:22,980
contracts so this is a kind of this kind

347
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,420
of evolved from the first version that

348
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,550
Kevin created he created the first

349
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,819
version back in March and like I said he

350
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:31,560
specifically was using an expo at the

351
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,279
time and then when I

352
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,199
I started to look at it to help him I

353
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,600
was gonna put a web app with it through

354
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,910
it through it then we realized there

355
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,410
needed to be some some changes to make

356
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,449
it a little simpler and live different

357
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,329
interfaces for UI sharing and cross

358
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:47,949
cross future sharing so basically we

359
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:50,829
kind of evolved it and then went through

360
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,389
you some design sessions and then Kevin

361
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:54,279
went back and and implemented version

362
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:57,970
one so this is what this usage contracts

363
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,949
look like for for cross feature sharing

364
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:02,230
so basically in this case and the facets

365
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,480
I've got a I'm saying that I'm going to

366
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,970
use these types of assets and I'm

367
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,740
basically I'm looking for a bar link

368
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,050
component and a cat route component and

369
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,399
a dog action dot D and I can actually

370
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,170
you know say whether it's by default

371
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,240
it'll be required I can say it's not

372
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,579
required so it won't fail if it's

373
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:23,649
missing so maybe it's something that

374
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,509
you're checking for and you know later

375
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:27,370
on that might feature might become

376
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,920
available and then you know you can have

377
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,420
a validation function he's got some

378
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,519
existing ones you can use and then you

379
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,559
can also supports wild cards so this is

380
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,509
kind of a neat concept because you could

381
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,500
say I'm gonna I'm gonna say throw out my

382
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,139
different features I'm going to specify

383
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,009
components that are going to show up on

384
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,459
the main menu of the app you know and so

385
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,250
so you can different features can all

386
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,420
you know or a different part that's

387
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,370
gonna show up on the on the different

388
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,649
route or whatever so for your app so

389
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:58,300
that way you can you can have loud cards

390
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,069
so then things can be added on the fly

391
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:03,430
and you know they'll show up the defined

392
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,990
part is where your feature is actually

393
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,100
providing the the facet and so you're

394
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,509
basically just saying here's a facet

395
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,100
here's the name and here's what you know

396
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,509
and I'm defining what it what it is so

397
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,339
I'm passing like here I'm actions food

398
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,189
actions and then if you use the the

399
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:20,170
third one that define use it basically

400
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,750
is saying I'm defining it but I also

401
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,449
expect it to be used somewhere so if

402
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:27,490
it's not then then go ahead and throw an

403
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,350
error because I know this should match

404
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,089
something that's already out there and

405
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,499
so I'm gonna use that so it's kind of a

406
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,179
third third thing is saying its defined

407
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,459
and used and so this is kind of nice if

408
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,019
you like I said if you know it should

409
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:39,490
match that'll just help catch you know

410
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,959
spelling spelling errors and stuff like

411
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,509
that so that'll make sure that it gets

412
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,119
used

413
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:47,660
cross features so this is a diagram that

414
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,119
shows kind of that in basically says he

415
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,249
features or defining at facets they're

416
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:55,550
using facets and then launch app is

417
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,170
basically making sure all these things

418
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,170
exist validating things putting all to

419
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,179
bring them all together and he does all

420
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:04,249
the work for you know for doing that and

421
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:05,829
there's different ways to get at it

422
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,929
so getting at these facets there's a

423
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:10,850
there's a higher-order component called

424
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,949
with facets that you can use to to

425
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,269
actually get it you know get different

426
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,300
facets there is also facets that's

427
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,709
provided and some of those lifecycle

428
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,600
hooks so in the app did start app will

429
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,589
start there's also an expand with facets

430
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,179
feature so sometimes you need this stuff

431
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:28,819
at like load time and it's not available

432
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:30,829
yet it because it's it's a dependency at

433
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,679
you'll be of a circular and dependency

434
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:35,569
so he actually allows you to provide to

435
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:38,959
wrap it your your function with a expand

436
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,389
with facets and then it'll pass you in

437
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:43,639
the facets at the right time then you

438
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,019
can do whatever you want with that and

439
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,610
then pass back the result and so that

440
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,230
that allows you to get around the you

441
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,290
know dependency dependency problems and

442
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,819
then finally launch app will also return

443
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:54,499
a facets object and so you can use that

444
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,800
in certain circumstances as well just to

445
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,269
you know to get at the facets so lots of

446
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,160
different ways to get get that he's got

447
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,679
great documentation for this alright so

448
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,230
the code walkthrough so I got a couple

449
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,380
different things some samples and stuff

450
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,470
kind of show you how this works all

451
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:19,490
right so let me go over to the where's

452
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,530
my mouse

453
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:29,000
I see it over there okay there we go I

454
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,070
can see it over there everybody all

455
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,040
right so here's an example of the the

456
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,290
source index so it basically just called

457
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,750
launch app you provided the an array of

458
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,430
aspects you provide an array of features

459
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,520
and then you call register root app so

460
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,960
kind of what we talked about in this

461
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,180
case it's for a web app so we'll call

462
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,330
I'll call react Dom render it's actually

463
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,680
going to give me the root element and I

464
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,690
just use that and put it where I want on

465
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,850
the Dom I can also call register

466
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,170
serviceworker and whatever else you want

467
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,400
so that's kind of the same stuff that

468
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,610
comes right out of create react app so

469
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,780
that's you know that's that get you up

470
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,490
and going right there no you know not a

471
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:11,150
lot of work there okay don't want to be

472
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,680
modifying stuff I'm just trying to show

473
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,510
it all right all right so then the next

474
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,790
thing the features I've got a bunch of

475
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,250
different features here so I basically

476
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,540
built this thing up one feature at a

477
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,800
time just to kind of see how that would

478
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,290
work and you know and Kevin just got

479
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,360
this version one done just a few weeks

480
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,010
ago I've been working he's been working

481
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,480
really hard on on getting it out so we

482
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,220
could show it to you guys so I you know

483
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,140
I really wanted to bring it here to J's

484
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,550
comp because this is a place where new

485
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,010
things are shown and new ideas so I

486
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,750
think it's just really exciting I you

487
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,590
know library in concept so this is so

488
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,790
he's different different features I've

489
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,730
got here and so right now they're all

490
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,010
commented out like you could also have

491
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,720
enabled you know turn them on and off

492
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,440
with an able all right so let me let me

493
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,670
just go here and turn an app feature on

494
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,530
and let me jump down and do then do the

495
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,190
next one

496
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,350
and when do one more job just don't do

497
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,590
three at a time here and jump in alright

498
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,030
so we'll save that go over here to my

499
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:21,320
app all right

500
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,750
okay so it's a basic simple app it's got

501
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,970
a right now it's got a home screen and

502
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,190
about paged about page says there's some

503
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,660
content here the home screen just is

504
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,830
actually just showing me the features

505
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,050
that are turned on so even even really

506
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,430
gotten to the meet yet but that was just

507
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,350
kind of you know let's let's start with

508
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,540
something so what does this code look

509
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,420
like so the app first thing you look at

510
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,490
I've created a feature name I needed any

511
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,840
wanted to be camelcase so I just put a

512
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,550
camel case around it you know obviously

513
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,020
this is a single single word it's not a

514
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,520
problem but if you people copy paste

515
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,900
code so I want to make sure that if they

516
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,060
use a dash or something at its camelcase

517
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,490
so it would always work and then

518
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,050
basically here's my app component I've

519
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,640
got a browser router so I've got a react

520
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,830
router implementation here I've got a

521
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,780
header so it says bookmark notes and

522
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,450
then I'm passing in some some links and

523
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,060
some routes and so and again this was

524
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,280
gonna be this will be provided down

525
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,060
below here so I'm just rendering those

526
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,140
in a header and then down here in the

527
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,240
main and then here's my create feature

528
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,000
further for app and so here I'm saying

529
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,180
okay i'm i'm wanting star dot link comp

530
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,500
so i you know you come up with some kind

531
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,970
of naming convention of how you want to

532
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,290
map these things you know maybe there's

533
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,180
you know you could even put main menu or

534
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,250
something dot link that component so I'm

535
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,230
gonna say I need links and I need routes

536
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,840
and I'm gonna display all those and then

537
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,430
here I'm taking advantage of the wheel

538
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,410
start I'm going ahead and I'm gonna get

539
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,450
the facets object and the current route

540
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,460
element and I'm actually the one that's

541
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,500
creating this app so I know that there's

542
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,360
no there shouldn't be an existing brude

543
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,430
app and so then I go ahead and do a

544
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,430
fastest get and get whatever I want in

545
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,050
this case I'm getting the the link

546
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,910
components and I'm also saying this with

547
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,770
keys and that just says I want to go

548
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,720
ahead and get the name along with the

549
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,850
the component so since it's got a unique

550
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,160
name already I want both things and give

551
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,900
it to me back an array that's optional

552
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,030
you could just use index or whatever but

553
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,380
I go ahead and get the link so they get

554
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,120
the routes and then I pass them in and

555
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,250
render it so that that's basically gets

556
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,210
you up and going and that's what

557
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,390
rendered that that bookmark page and

558
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,580
then then the next thing let's look at

559
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,530
the about because that's you know real

560
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,720
simple

561
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,340
dear okay alright so again same similar

562
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,500
thing it's called about I'm saying that

563
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,480
the URL path is slash about you know you

564
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,890
could change that if you wanted but I

565
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,690
just used the that as a neat unique name

566
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,390
so here I'm creating a link component so

567
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,850
with link compassing in the the URL and

568
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,320
here's the route component passing in

569
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,870
the URL here's my you know great content

570
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,880
and then down here I'm saying alright

571
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,530
I'm defining this and expected to be

572
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,790
used somewhere it should be you should

573
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,100
match so I'm saying this feature name

574
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,350
about link dot component you could

575
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,580
obviously just type it out but I don't

576
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,990
want to just make this kind of generic

577
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,060
and so there there that's all you need

578
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,640
to be able to push that into the to the

579
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,350
system once it got pulled in by the

580
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,560
feature index launch app is able to just

581
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,840
find it and hook it up and match the

582
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,390
wildcards and then it shows up so then

583
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,430
the same thing and if we look at the the

584
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:26,910
other the home page one it's basically

585
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,460
just pulling in the features list and

586
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,600
then iterating through those and

587
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,830
printing those out so I'm basically just

588
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,150
want to show you know what features are

589
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,910
being defined it and and so it's same

590
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,260
kind of thing it's providing a link and

591
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,620
a component and alright and so then we

592
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,130
could go back over to features on see

593
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,280
there alright so now let's get a couple

594
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:54,480
more features going all right so I'm

595
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,530
gonna this now I'm gonna pull in the

596
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,060
list feature and a load canned feature

597
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,160
so let's say you're developing you don't

598
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,270
even have a you know you're not have the

599
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,860
data yet so you're gonna go ahead and

600
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,200
develop the list component and you know

601
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:11,010
next and then you know and then I'm

602
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,630
gonna go ahead and load it in some data

603
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,700
just some canned data so this is nice

604
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,990
because if you know maybe the API is not

605
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,090
even written yet you know so you could

606
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,740
just pull in an object structure that

607
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,750
you're used to

608
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,560
okay so it's one of the warnings so now

609
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,680
I'm actually since I'm starting to use

610
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,450
reducers and and and logic now I'm gonna

611
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,890
I've got to turn those on so I didn't

612
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,180
have those originally on because I

613
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,400
didn't need them so let me just flip

614
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,610
that on so back up here I've got the

615
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,770
feature Redux has an aspect and create

616
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,750
logic aspect from rejects logic so

617
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,280
let me turn those on and then and it'll

618
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:53,320
be ready to go all right let's see if

619
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,040
that solves it okay so now we've got a a

620
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,780
we can see all the different features

621
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,020
that are turned on here and then there's

622
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,930
our about and here's our list and the

623
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,750
list actually had a search you know so

624
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,050
we can search by whatever it's doing a

625
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,220
case insensitive search on this and you

626
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,770
know we can we can do remove and you

627
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,150
know and then of course it's the using

628
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,240
can data so if we refresh it then it

629
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,590
comes right back so it doesn't really

630
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,300
you know save anything but at least we

631
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,890
can make sure everything works and all

632
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,910
that so let's quickly look at that so

633
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:39,350
that what did that look like so the list

634
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,270
okay so for the list we had we've got a

635
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,910
we're using we're providing actions in

636
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,140
case somebody else wants to use some of

637
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,640
our actions we're creating we're

638
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,100
providing some selectors and then down

639
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,270
here I'm providing a link and a

640
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,160
component I'm saying for sure define and

641
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,570
use I'm expecting that to be used

642
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,430
somewhere these other ones may or may

643
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,900
not be used I'm just saying in future

644
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,900
somebody might need them and then up

645
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,760
here I'm you know as my Redux stuff so

646
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,290
I've got I'm creating some actions

647
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,570
there's some selectors some initial

648
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,170
state I've got I'm using a my feature

649
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,120
name as kind of the namespace for my

650
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,110
state

651
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,300
Sophy feature you has a nice way to be

652
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,790
able to merge your your reducers

653
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,380
together you just need to know where you

654
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,270
want it to to map it into the global

655
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,150
state so I'm just defining that as the

656
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,650
the path it could be you know something

657
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,380
dot something or whatever and then down

658
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,360
here we've got the create actions so

659
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,070
these are just using the Redux actions

660
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,390
to create some actions and they're here

661
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,360
I'm creating a reducer and then here's a

662
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,390
link again to the path and then here's

663
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,850
my selecting so I can do the the search

664
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,410
and then here I'm rendering that rending

665
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,680
or all my items and then exporting it

666
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,420
out as the great feature so that's

667
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,660
that's that and here's my go over to the

668
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,680
load canned here I've got my I can list

669
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,130
of data I'm using this expand with

670
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,200
facets so that I'm providing logic but

671
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,640
it's going to make a call back and say

672
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,590
give me facet so I can go ahead and pull

673
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,020
out the list out actions because that's

674
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,280
going to be giving me the type that I

675
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,840
want to match up here for greed X logic

676
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,530
so I'm creating this I'm doing a

677
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,520
asynchronous call and I'm just

678
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,280
responding with a canned list and then

679
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,770
that gets dispatched out and in rendered

680
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,050
so that and then here I'm using apt-get

681
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,400
start so I'm actually kicking that off

682
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,950
so it'll dispatch this this load when it

683
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,750
when it launches up so I don't you don't

684
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,090
have to have any hard-coded stuff there

685
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,550
all right

686
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,490
and then so then I think we're about

687
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,620
we're about wrapping up here but let me

688
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,550
get to the next the final one so this

689
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:51,950
mouse is hard so I think it features

690
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,980
there we go alright so now now let's say

691
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,380
let's go ahead and just finish it we

692
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,640
will go ahead and we're going to bring

693
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,990
in the air there's an add feature what

694
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,550
we're gonna add things and then we'll go

695
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,750
ahead and save things in local forage

696
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,070
it'll use whatever you know the browser

697
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,600
has for storage capabilities and so now

698
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,670
if we go back over here we've got all

699
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,570
the things turned on and then we can you

700
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,350
know add a new new thing here and it

701
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,840
shows up down here you know we still got

702
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,130
the search and about and lists and all

703
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,750
that so basically all working and yeah

704
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,670
so that that you know it basically works

705
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,750
I mean you can basically build these

706
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,060
things up you know feature at a time

707
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,550
make and basically swap the the new

708
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,070
storage feature in and swapped out the

709
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,960
old can feature and you know if

710
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,150
everything is all matched up then it'll

711
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,970
just boom you're ready to go so you know

712
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,290
it's pretty nice to build those just to

713
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,180
upgrade things you can easily roll back

714
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,620
to the previous thing you could do it

715
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,150
you know a/b testing and whatever so

716
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,030
that's kind of nice so let me go back to

717
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,820
the code and lock her hit the home

718
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,570
stretch here alright so

719
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,250
okay and then there's another app that

720
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,870
the Kevin wrote that's called eatery nod

721
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,919
and I'll just show you I won't go into

722
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,970
details with it no that's the only one

723
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,470
because the run late on time but

724
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,200
basically it's a you got links to it in

725
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,260
my and mine show notes he's got it it's

726
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,789
well documented with Doc diagrams

727
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:30,770
everything so this is like a it'll react

728
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,539
native app that you Expo app that you

729
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:34,850
can have restaurants be pulled in and

730
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,679
then create a list of those and then

731
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:38,659
basically it would be a random list so

732
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:39,860
if you have trouble deciding where to

733
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,679
take your your significant other you can

734
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,000
just pull up this app and press the

735
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,409
button it'll randomly pick something and

736
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:47,480
then you you can use that to to go and

737
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,890
so that's what he created it just kind

738
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,919
of wants something fun and so it's all

739
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,480
well document as far as that goes but he

740
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,010
does the same concept and since it has

741
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,080
all those hooks it works great for react

742
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,419
native and works great for for react web

743
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:01,940
so he's got authorization so it's it's

744
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,530
it's all it's a full app and he's got it

745
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,880
all blown out in two different separate

746
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,580
files and everything so I'll just let

747
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,860
you look at that on your own he is uh

748
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:21,230
let's see next all right okay so finally

749
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:28,190
the where was they out on here best

750
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,350
practices of just a few things to note I

751
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,200
think it's pretty simple to use once you

752
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,929
try it but you know the good thing is to

753
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:37,669
avoid cross feature imports so instead

754
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:39,919
of importing from feature a to feature B

755
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,799
directly use the you know use the facets

756
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,510
sharing and that makes it plug-and-play

757
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,860
so then if something else comes along

758
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,330
and implements those features you can

759
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,100
turn this one off turn that one up you

760
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,270
know so you don't have to be changing

761
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,980
you know a lot of files with imports and

762
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,049
things so that that's great it also

763
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:56,419
helps for swapping and for a/b testing

764
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,789
for mocking all that kind of stuff take

765
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:00,380
advantage of the uses contracts you know

766
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,030
the define used and they use so that

767
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,890
basically will catch spelling mistakes

768
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,220
use wildcards to be able to pull things

769
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,490
in for like the menus and all that

770
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,539
feature name is required to be unique

771
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:13,880
and it'll complain if it's not and and

772
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,559
so normally if you're using a single

773
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,760
file and you can put it right in there

774
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,770
but if you're using lots of other files

775
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,800
and you're going to use

776
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,570
in those files then it's a good practice

777
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,980
to put it in a separate file and just

778
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,870
import that into the various things

779
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,820
that'll prevent circular dependencies

780
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,590
and all that so that's just a kind of a

781
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,780
note that once you've been do any stuff

782
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,910
so so I think it really simplifies

783
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,380
things I mean it was I was really

784
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,150
impressed at how it got things up and

785
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,550
going and in it also just made it very

786
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,280
easy to get redux up and going and Redux

787
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,450
logic you didn't really have to mess

788
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,160
with you know we just pulled in the

789
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,930
aspect and then it did all the wiring

790
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,700
and then basically now we just create

791
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,800
features and define a reducer define a

792
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,110
logic and and it pulls it in wires add

793
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,250
up where it needs to go so I thought

794
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,080
that was really nice you know it's it's

795
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,480
kind of it's easier to do that than most

796
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,790
anything so besides to be able to do

797
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,200
feature development it's also nice for

798
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,690
just getting wired up flexible in

799
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,610
extensible this is he's you know is he

800
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,990
started with a few different

801
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,490
technologies but you could extend this

802
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,080
to anything it's really there's nothing

803
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,540
that's locking it down he's kind of got

804
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,330
some great documentation here to to show

805
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,130
that it could be used on other languages

806
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:22,350
and frameworks the let me just bring up

807
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,320
the page here so this is feed chaos

808
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,710
Kevin a est feature U is his website

809
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,910
again he's got a lot of great Doc's in

810
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,420
here he's got a feature UJS that org is

811
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,150
his documentation site and it's it's

812
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,560
awesome you know you just goes through

813
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,000
and explains everything how it works

814
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,120
down here is the core API you know so it

815
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,650
breaks out all the things I talked about

816
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,240
and in difference one thing I didn't

817
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,240
mention is it kind of uses objects for a

818
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,700
lot of the parameters and so sometimes

819
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,440
the way this API there where this

820
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,000
renders it doesn't really show you those

821
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,520
are it's like a named parameter or a D

822
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,950
structured Brammer and so but there is

823
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,690
basically objects that you're passing

824
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,800
into for a lot of these parameters and

825
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,600
so you don't have to necessarily use all

826
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,100
of them if you just need one or two you

827
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,780
can just specify the ones you need so

828
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,480
just just a note of there but yeah this

829
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,490
is a great he does great Jackman tation

830
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,190
so this is fantastic for that let's see

831
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,850
I think we're down to the final thing so

832
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,070
that slides were at code winds calm /j s

833
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,780
comp 2018 there's the other repo stuff

834
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,860
contact me if you've got questions or

835
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,710
whatever I'm happy to answer that or

836
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,000
have a beer later you know let me know

837
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,520
you got ideas or or things you want to

838
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,389
use it for

839
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:34,979
Twitter handle and github is Jeff Biscay

840
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:37,379
and I appreciate let me speak to you

841
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:38,800
thank you
