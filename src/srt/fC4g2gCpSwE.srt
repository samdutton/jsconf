00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,619

the JavaScript unconference is a

2
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,449
conference by the community for

3
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,990
community they proposed talks the people

4
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,520
vote of the talks and then the most

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:45,930
famous topics will be held so this is

6
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,190
the third year we are running this

7
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,350
conference and for the first time we get

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,110
more than 400 participants we got 30

9
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,690
trucks and the priority of course is

10
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,190
pretty great we got everything from

11
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,250
protocols to CSS and everything

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:17,600
JavaScript related

13
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:30,730
you

14
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,820
Oh what I like about the JavaScript

15
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,939
community mostly the people already open

16
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:41,360
line it and yeah I can just find that

17
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,090
every conferences great people to talk I

18
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,460
guess I really like the the fact that we

19
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,049
have these these long breaks in between

20
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,090
that it's not sort of like go go go from

21
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,500
one talk to another we have a couple

22
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,570
talks and then lunch a couple talks and

23
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,850
thinks we can be people talk with them

24
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,530
find out what everybody is doing here I

25
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,390
like the whole package I would stay and

26
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,369
I like the style of the conference that

27
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:02,869
you don't know what will happen to look

28
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,610
around it's just basically a bunch of

29
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,789
nice people helping each other and

30
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,619
sharing knowledge it was interesting

31
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:11,540
that you get a surprise you're coming

32
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,150
here then some people randomly say hey I

33
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,250
want to speak about this and then we all

34
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,280
both about what we want to say so I like

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,230
the spontaneous way of this the

36
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,970
community is growing it's so interesting

37
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,280
and conferences like this is a great

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,319
place to learn new things and I don't

39
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,630
see the distinction between the people

40
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,099
who have the knowledge and the people

41
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,500
who don't so everyone knows something

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,600
and just shared and so it's great all

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,680
the connections that you can do in the

44
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,570
just in the toes but also outside you

45
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,579
know and the main room and meet the

46
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:46,730
people talk about their feelings know a

47
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,250
little bit what they are doing you know

48
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,019
and it's very informal everything and

49
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:53,480
that's what makes gsm conference maybe

50
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:41,930
the best conference in europe
