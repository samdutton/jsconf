1
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,199
Thank you.

2
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,109
My name is Jan Jongboom.

3
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,279
I'm living in Amsterdam.

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,239
I work in Norway.

5
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,029
Travel to Asia all the time.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,619
I feel right at home with all the nomads.

7
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:39,250
It is a telecom that pays me to work.

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,870
Half my time I work on Firefox.

9
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,440
And working on the keyboard.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:57,659
You guys are all the creme de la creme 
of JS.

11
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:04,129
I'm writing a book on Firefox OS.

12
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,129
I designed my own cover.

13
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,720
He didn't have it ready.

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,060
They didn't go for this at Manning.

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,060
Now it looks like this.

16
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,330
If you are interested in Firefox OS.

17
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,750
How to make cool web applications that look
cool.

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,530
Go to my twitter.

19
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,600
As half the presenters I am going to start
with a confession.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:43,719
The moment that I sent in my talk proposal,
I did not own a screwdriver.

21
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:48,429
This is the worst way to get started on a
hardware talk.

22
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:53,649
2 weeks ago I had everything up and running.

23
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:57,380
But, all my demo's were still in mobile phone.

24
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,000
I had to disect it.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,850
The result is wonderful.

26
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:11,360
A lesson learned is, if I can do this without
owning a screwdriver, you can build cool stuff

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,700
with things you learn in the presentation.

28
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,290
My timer is not running.

29
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,599
The maker movement is at the moment everywhere.

30
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,599
I was an Malaysia.

31
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:37,489
A guy came up to me, we have a maker place,
come down and fiddle with us.

32
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:43,190
We build stuff.

33
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:50,120
And the reason we can do it, these new little
development boards, for example what we saw

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,659
in the disco.

35
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,730
They are here, cheap.

36
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,730
Microcontrollers.

37
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,299
Computers have become so fast.

38
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:00,810
They can be tiny and do cool stuff.

39
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,950
The second thing is, that you can attach phone
sensors to this.

40
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:14,459
The whole explosion of smartphones makes that
having sensors that control your gravity or

41
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,200
small camera's, have become very very cheap.

42
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,909
You can attach them.

43
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,680
There is a downside.

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,790
This is how an average Raspberry pie looks
like.

45
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:34,379
It is too complicated.

46
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,939
I can't stick things in little...

47
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,120
You know.

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,439
On top of that, the hardware that you can
attach is expensive.

49
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,629
Why do I have to pay 35 euro?

50
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,599
If I can get one for 25.

51
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:58,129
One and one is 2.

52
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:04,290
I took one of my phones.

53
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,159
Developer preview device.

54
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,770
It has bluetooth, Wifi, 3G, 2 camera's.

55
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,219
It is a little bit more expensive than 25
euro.

56
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:21,670
If I can abuse that, I don't need to connect
any external things.

57
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,401
And it is cheaper.

58
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,830
It runs Firefox OS.

59
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,060
Why is that cool?

60
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,420
It works like this.

61
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,830
I have a phone.

62
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,830
Linux Kernel.

63
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,970
Then I have Gecko on top of that.

64
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,590
And Html5 Ui.

65
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,890
Every piece of UI needs to go through Gecko.

66
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,890
Every Api that does cool shit is included
in Gecko.

67
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:57,510
If I strip that off, I have a supercheap phone
with Javascript.

68
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,230
That is perfect for hackers.

69
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:09,440
This is awesome zozer what you get when you
search for awesome kids on Google.

70
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,090
This is how you start.

71
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,250
You take a Firefox Os phone.

72
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,560
Unscrew it.

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,550
You crack it open.

74
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,550
And end up with this.

75
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:33,040
This is a tiny printboard that controls everyone
on the phone.

76
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,600
You can't see it from the back.

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,390
It contains 2 camera's, everything.

78
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,390
That's amazing.

79
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,470
Very small.

80
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,260
So we got a sim card reader, sd card.

81
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,330
The screen connector.

82
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,330
One camera.

83
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,590
One in the front.

84
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,950
Flashlight and touchscreen.

85
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,840
Plug and play.

86
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Don't need the screen.

87
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
Disconnect it.

88
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,710
The camera is easily detached.

89
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,840
Because it fell out.

90
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,220
But then, I found something wonderful.

91
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,310
This camera's have a standard connector zozer
You can go to China and buy a better camera

92
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,310
for the phone.

93
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,820
It doesn't fit in the printboard.

94
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:30,190
We are not needing it to fit in a phone, we
can buy a new camera and attach that.

95
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,550
Blew my mind.

96
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,550
Yes.

97
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,160
Then there is at the bottom something.

98
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,760
This is connected to the screen.

99
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,120
I don't know what it is.

100
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,980
I ripped it apart and it still worked.

101
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,490
So...

102
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,310
Basically, you end up with this.

103
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,740
A print board.

104
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,370
The thing at the left is it does radio communication.

105
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,410
An antenna extension you plug in.

106
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:07,750
If you want to do something with data over
3g, or phone calls.

107
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,270
And you'll end up with the casing.

108
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,720
It has a touchscreen and normal screen.

109
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,220
I want those to separate as well.

110
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,990
The thing is, at cheap smartphones they are
glued together.

111
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,820
I tried a screwdriver to unblue these.

112
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,830
It broke and cracked.

113
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,600
I can only detach the touchscreen.

114
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,580
This is the touchscreen connecter.

115
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,900
That didn't work out that well either.

116
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,250
So the demo's today don't involve a screen.

117
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,300
So, then we got this board.

118
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,720
Wifi doesn't work.

119
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,370
And that really puzzled me.

120
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,290
I figured, the radiochip has something to
do with this.

121
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,100
I saw the connectors at the backcover of the
phone.

122
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,680
They look like paper with a copperplating.

123
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,260
This little thing.

124
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,140
If you attach it with tape to your phone.

125
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,430
You'll go from zero to 12.

126
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,830
I am still puzzled how it works.

127
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,420
I'm a software guy.

128
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,090
This is real tape.

129
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,210
For your hardware solutions.

130
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,710
It is small.

131
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,560
3/4 of a creditcard.

132
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,969
In all fairness.

133
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,700
I first put the creditcard next to the thing.

134
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,200
And only 5 minutes for the talk I remembered,
you could see my creditcard number.

135
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:53,000
So what we have is the little board.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
Gecko running on top.

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,850
And we can build something cool.

138
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,930
I don't have a problem with anything.

139
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,930
Jan OS.

140
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:10,230
The 
unofficial logo.

141
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:21,560
JanOs is an alternative to firefox Os.

142
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,300
You can run it at any rooted Firefox Os phone.

143
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,070
It is made to run on the board.

144
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,120
There is nothing.

145
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,670
It gives you a Javascript console.

146
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:42,800
If you 
put a sim card in.

147
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,750
And, I made another mistake.

148
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:58,230
I broke the casing of my phone while I was
trying to fiddle with it.

149
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,710
With one hand do this.

150
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,860
Go to my computer.

151
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,440
Type the flash command.

152
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,460
So, please keep your backcover intact.

153
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,920
Because everything fits together and makes
it a lot easier to flash.

154
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,890
JanOs is easy.

155
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,220
It is an Html file.

156
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,020
We just render 1 Html file.

157
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,340
And it has Javascript.

158
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:30,560
You can device stuff with it.

159
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,390
You can also connect the firefox developer
tools to this phone.

160
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:40,940
So, if you want a Javascript debugger, use
the normal Firefox debugger.

161
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,140
It is powerful.

162
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,560
I'll show you in a second.

163
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,190
There is a bunch of things you can do.

164
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,500
Make a security camera.

165
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,740
Take a photo every 5 seconds.

166
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,590
See if something changed.

167
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,700
If so, make a photo.

168
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,470
Send it to me over Mms or email.

169
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,710
Maybe if something is going on, you can call.

170
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,340
You can put a sim card in.

171
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,830
Plus, my little printboard has 4Gb of storage.

172
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,330
So, if you want to do that, 7 lines of code.

173
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,100
You say, camera takepicture.

174
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
It resolves.

175
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,270
You get a blob.

176
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,980
Can be on the Sd card or what you have.

177
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,910
And say storage addnamed.

178
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,130
Easy.

179
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,870
Another one, a doorbell.

180
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,990
Like I bought a wireless doorbell.

181
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,800
It was more expensive than the phone.

182
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,620
It is not wireless at all.

183
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,010
I still have to push a button in front of
my door.

184
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:57,220
I figured, if we use the phone, then we can
do it wireless.

185
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,150
The phone has a proximity sensor.

186
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:05,250
You can wave the doorpost.

187
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,450
It plays over bluetooth.

188
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,040
It has a front camera next to the sensor.

189
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,840
You can include a videostream.

190
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:23,160
This is cheaper than any of the doorbells
with camera.

191
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,320
Also doing this is 8 lines.

192
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,970
I can connec to any device.

193
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,550
I have to have the ID to it.

194
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:37,050
If the user is near, within 10-15 cm, then
play a sound.

195
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,070
It will play over bluetooth.

196
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,430
Last example that I have.

197
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,529
This is me and my friends.

198
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:52,420
In the middle you see a red boy with a cigarette,
Brian.

199
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,300
He has an annoying tendency.

200
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,900
He gets lost a lot.

201
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,770
We were in Warsaw.

202
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,890
Brian didn't find the apartment back at 5
am.

203
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,440
He slept on a bench on a square.

204
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,210
He had to be friends with a bum.

205
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,770
His phone is always dead.

206
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:25,589
So, I figured, the BrianTracker!

207
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:28,250
I can take the board, solder battery to it.

208
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,850
Have a 2G connection.

209
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,550
And whenever he is lost, I can send a push
notification, it will tell the geolocation

210
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,870
and tadaa!

211
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,500
Here is the cool thing.

212
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,960
A screen is eating most of your battery time.

213
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,930
So, this solution will run 2 weeks on the
default battery without charging it.

214
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,880
That's pretty amazing.

215
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,670
You can build useful stuff with this board.

216
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:09,149
The next thing.

217
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,920
Let's do some demo's.

218
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,839
This was me at the afterparty yesterday.

219
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:29,540
We have, what I have here is one of the boards
that I removed from one of the phones.

220
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,899
And now I can connect to this.

221
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:41,850
And now I have, zoom in, I have a JS console
I can talk do.

222
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,170
And do device things with.

223
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:54,550
For example, if I want to read the devicemotion.

224
00:14:54,550 --> 00:15:00,260
I get the horizontal accelleration including
gravity.

225
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:06,880
If I turn it around, it gets into the minus!

226
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,090
(applause)

227
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,290
okay.

228
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:16,810
That is pretty cool.

229
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,280
Now a new problem.

230
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,830
If you do something on this board that draws
too much power, like connect to wifi.

231
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:30,860
And you don't have a battery attached, it
will shut down.

232
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,740
If you hotwire 2 of the wires, then you can
probably solve that.

233
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,650
You have seen what happened when I tried to
deconnect the screen.

234
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,990
I don't trust myself soldering stuff.

235
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,660
For that I have a second thing.

236
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,660
It is in the casing.

237
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,340
I can hold the battery with it and simcard.

238
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,470
I'm going to connect this now.

239
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:05,330
Here we go.

240
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:12,220
We can connect here as well.

241
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,680
There is a simcard in here.

242
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,100
It detects if the simcard is here.

243
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:26,710
And enable data over 2G or 3G.

244
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,140
It doesn't eat any data unless you tell it.

245
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,670
You can buy a prepaid simcard.

246
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,310
You can't buy it here.

247
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:42,959
You need to have an address and your mom and
give your birthright.

248
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,959
But with my Dutch card it works.

249
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,370
It works.

250
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,830
For example, we have the security cam feature.

251
00:16:54,830 --> 00:17:00,050
Let me demonstrate it.

252
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,490
Read the back camera.

253
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:08,770
Do it every 3 seconds.

254
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,669
And now, hold it like this.

255
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:18,240
I will take a photo every 3 seconds.

256
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,959
Okay.

257
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,020
That's 3 photo's.

258
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,770
I can stop it again.

259
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,230
Now it saved it to the internal storage.

260
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,950
And because there is Linux running on the
thing.

261
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,659
It is based on the Android kernel.

262
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:41,009
Out of the card.

263
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,100
Yeah!

264
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,190
(applause)

265
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:53,799
i 
did not promise the images would be sharp.

266
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:58,059
You can't get me on that.

267
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,669
The other demo.

268
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:03,080
What I brought today.

269
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,989
The sound people put it here carefully.

270
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:11,659
Bluetooth speaker.

271
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:16,669
And now, I'm going to talk to bluetooth.

272
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:24,110
Put that one on.

273
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,399
Start doorbell.

274
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,269
Start it again.

275
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:33,080
It found the thing.

276
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,630
It pairs.

277
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:40,330
When I hover over the proximity sensor, it
will start playing doorbell.

278
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,919
(doorbell)

279
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,679
A bit soft.

280
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:54,610
Remove it and it stops.

281
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,200
(applause)

282
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,789
okay.

283
00:18:57,789 --> 00:18:59,409
It also has Wifi built in.

284
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,869
I hope my tape holds.

285
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,369
Because I wanted to do tracking.

286
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:09,190
For that you need Wifi connection.

287
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,789
It makes it better if you do it indoors.

288
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:18,509
Enable Wifi.

289
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:20,490
Tries to connect to Jsfest.

290
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:26,850
I hope it is going to work.

291
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:32,480
My mom always told me to never do any live
demo's.

292
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,010
But here we go.

293
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,010
It is connected with Jsfest.

294
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,739
We need an Ip.

295
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:37,739
We have Wifi connection.

296
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:42,499
It is cool.

297
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:45,110
And now I can start my tracker.

298
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,419
Let's say that I'm Brian.

299
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,239
At this moment I'm lost.

300
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:57,299
This is the BrianTracker.

301
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,240
There is no registration yet.

302
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,590
If I tell tracker start.

303
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:10,660
It will register at the pushserver that Mozilla
has.

304
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,470
We don't have the location from Brian yet.

305
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,429
All we need to do is check, request new location.

306
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:24,669
The phone in a couple of seconds will receive
a push message.

307
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:31,230
Based on that it is going to use the geolocation
Api to find out where we are.

308
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,460
And communicate it back.

309
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,770
We got a push message.

310
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,320
Permissions are for suckers.

311
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,970
This is my device.

312
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,490
I can do anything.

313
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,519
We send our location.

314
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,470
And now, a couple of seconds later.

315
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,460
You use static maps.

316
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,259
We are blocked here.

317
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:55,950
When I click on it, we can redirect it.

318
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,320
And find out where we are.

319
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,539
(applause)

320
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:17,059
now I'm going back to my slide.

321
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,980
There is so much more you can do with this
setup.

322
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,250
Because, there is a flashlight on this thing.

323
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,809
Two camera's.

324
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:33,679
You can walk around and make photo's from
this and this side.

325
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,549
The only way to experience this.

326
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:38,029
This is what I have seen so much.

327
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:40,500
Is get hacking.

328
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,260
Buy a firefox phone.

329
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:49,289
You can get it for 60 euro on Ebay.

330
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,309
Crack it open.

331
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:56,830
Flash my JanOs on it and write your own scripts.

332
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,799
You are in charge.

333
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:02,799
Even if you are not a hardware nerd.

334
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,419
That's freaking amazing.

335
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:06,240
With that I want to thank you for being here.

336
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Hopefully see you next year!

337
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Yes!

338
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
(applause)

339
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
it is the first time ever that I finished
my talk in the timeslot.
