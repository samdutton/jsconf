00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,790

my name is John Schultz and as I said

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,849
I'm here to speak about canvas in nodejs

3
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,020
real briefly about me currently at

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,199
include in DC web consultant company

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,189
design firm that do mostly web

6
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,930
consulting before that I was at Omni TI

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,359
which was also another web consulting

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,019
company while it on the API we released

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,670
a monitoring service called Sur CONUS

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,750
and I did a lot of work with charting

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,369
there that's part of where some of this

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,110
stuff came from and you can find on

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,550
Twitter at JFS III so why are we doing

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,120
canvas um no it's to replace either this

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,860
script tag which is loading to library

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,629
and then instantiating it or an iframe

17
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:51,469
with image source equals and that

18
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:54,000
stilled only get you to but why are you

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,190
doing canvas a node and the best ways

20
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,230
give you a use case so we had made some

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,149
Kansas based charts for customer and

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,980
they really liked them and they wanted

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,140
to put the charts in their wiki canvas

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,850
based charts need a browser or a

25
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,920
document and iframes a good way to do

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,990
that and just you would link to whatever

27
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,670
normal content is and put you know

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,260
chrome equals false or something along

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,659
those lines unfriend problem is wiki's

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,220
don't allow my friends or most don't so

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,540
I really really want to make this work I

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,310
mean it seemed like a completely valid

33
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,170
use case to take these charts we had

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,299
worked on and get him to work at their

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,220
company then it was a compliment they

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,540
liked our stuff enough that they wanted

37
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,189
to share these items within the company

38
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,320
so it did a little looking and I did

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,180
find a project called Rhino canvas but

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,729
it is it looks dead in the water I

41
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,340
haven't seen any activity since I was 6

42
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,740
so I made a request on Twitter just some

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,990
of the people I could think about

44
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,189
basically you get what are you talking

45
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,140
about its image why are you doing an

46
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,640
image on the server or a specific item

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,579
canvas which is clearly a browser item

48
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,369
on the server I did talk to some other

49
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,409
people and Kiro was mentioned akairo

50
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,820
does SVG p and june PDF generation does

51
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,369
a lot of stuff it's got hooks for PHP

52
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,670
Perl a whole lot of other languages so I

53
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,060
thought that if I had to wherewithal

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,330
I could just reimplemented see but that

55
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,270
wasn't the most exciting thing to me the

56
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,099
good news is I'm serious three days

57
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,540
after I figured out that I would use

58
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,150
canvas I mean uh Cairo TJ has some post

59
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,610
about how he's almost done with no

60
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,180
candles so thankfully a couple weeks

61
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,980
after that learn Bruce and TJ released

62
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,099
note canvas and does exactly what I was

63
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,860
trying to do and it's canvas API

64
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,480
compatible so you get all the stuff you

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,150
expect you get move to line to stroke

66
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,580
Phil Phil rectangle everything you

67
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,130
expect out of a canvas instance and it

68
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,140
gives you a couple other items which to

69
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,280
which are really poor one of which is

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,530
really important to me create PNG stream

71
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,190
and to buffer so I'm going through a

72
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,799
couple examples this example is a little

73
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,090
bit trimmed down from the one that's on

74
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,060
the new canvas site and notice here I

75
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,530
mean I made a note in the comments the

76
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,360
only difference between a typical canvas

77
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,390
script is that one after acquire canvas

78
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,360
and then really char instantiation that

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,190
instead of saying canvas equals document

80
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,079
create new canvas canvas dot height

81
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,850
equals canvas now with equals you just

82
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,810
passed the height and width and the

83
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,359
constructor from there on you right

84
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,459
create canvas like you normally would

85
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,410
here I'm doing to data URL which is

86
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,590
standard method and that gives you you

87
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,390
know big data your I which we produce

88
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,120
woot here's gradients and again the only

89
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,100
two items that are the change here

90
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,160
require canvas and new canvas everything

91
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,889
else is the same this is the image that

92
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,010
it generates

93
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,750
oh yeah I was doing some editing yeah

94
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,880
it's not that magical I was changing the

95
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,290
plane around sighs sorry about that yeah

96
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,070
it's definitely type of a graph or

97
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,580
whatever a sparkline similar item this

98
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,110
is all what you would do in canvas that

99
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,130
you were doing on a client side so that

100
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,890
gets me close it means it's possible for

101
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,890
me to write canvas and node the real

102
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,290
issue is though for me I can't I still

103
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,090
can't use flot over on the server side I

104
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,890
don't want to spend my time writing a

105
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,270
charting library there's already one out

106
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,860
there there works in particular the

107
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,630
customer liked our graphs we had made

108
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,190
some new data visualizations we've done

109
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,050
you know customizing of the colors

110
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,340
whatever I didn't feel like doing that

111
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,450
work again so flot uses jQuery jQuery

112
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,430
uses the Dom so you have to find a way

113
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,220
to get the Dom onto the server and that

114
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,260
thanks to Elijah

115
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,500
can be in J's dome as possible Jase Tom

116
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,000
which are fuselages talked this morning

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,010
but it's a way to get the Dom it's a

118
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,000
common jazz implementation of the Dom so

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,050
why like that would be the Dom or so the

120
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,760
way jQuery I'm sorry go ahead

121
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,970
so the way within a we run the plot on

122
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,760
the server side and we basically go to

123
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,340
strapped a couple jQuery functions and

124
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,290
then the only problem is that where some

125
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,380
reason flawed uses Dom for the labels

126
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,210
mm-hmm but there's a project that

127
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,830
implements labels in camera correct I'd

128
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,940
love to get that actually was talking to

129
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,470
TJ about it I was trying to know the

130
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,840
project called drawback so what it does

131
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,310
is basically be able to share the same

132
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,100
code and apply an observer as far as

133
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,060
sports actually

134
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,960
of my chart and then for the server-side

135
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,970
ads hooks so for example if you want to

136
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,340
get up great view of the chart it's

137
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,750
gonna execute the same code and also

138
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,940
load additional plugins server like for

139
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,490
example rather than text in the canvas

140
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,630
gotcha

141
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,790
so we can go into that afterwards but

142
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,870
where camera was saying was that they

143
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,250
have done some work to make to where you

144
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,920
don't even need a s Dom to have jQuery

145
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,480
wrong I did like I said I was talking to

146
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,130
that TGA about it and I couldn't get a

147
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,510
hold of that so I found you'll see in a

148
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,100
minute here way that while it does

149
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,450
require to loading some additional stuff

150
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,070
it was also the minimum amount of work

151
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,060
that was required for me so jess tom is

152
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,330
incredible and it currently gives you

153
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,200
Dom level 1 & 2 browser support and with

154
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,300
that Dom I can now get jQuery to run on

155
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,970
the server here's an example - the same

156
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,980
same thing that a lodger had this

157
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,530
morning just get jazz Dom in this

158
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,880
particular case you're loading nodejs

159
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
title work and then going to inject

160
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,470
jQuery made a note that that is

161
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,380
production jQuery when it's ready their

162
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,300
runs jQuery against that content and

163
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,300
counts the number of anchors the number

164
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,820
of links that are there so you can do

165
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,030
screen scraping in this example GS Dom

166
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,290
so patching plot was really simple

167
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,780
because that canvas API is API

168
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,940
compatible all I really had to do in

169
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,770
flock was just go to the place where

170
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,470
that canvas was created and make a

171
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,510
change to it just did a branch and there

172
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,760
was one other thing which is that flot

173
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,830
in particular wants a width and a height

174
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,860
which it grabs from the Dom element so

175
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,300
since there wasn't a width and height or

176
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,010
jQuery wasn't able to determine those I

177
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,530
made it give it the config option of

178
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,210
giving it a width and a height so

179
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,160
technically I had a couple more lines

180
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,020
however that can that's a complaint

181
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,240
that's common in fly is that I want to

182
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,790
tell you how the dimensions of this

183
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,580
image perhaps you've got a div or

184
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,140
something that is off screen at the

185
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,630
moment so if it's hidden Ischl e slot

186
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,030
would see that as 0 0 and wouldn't

187
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,590
render it anyway so you can't pre-render

188
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,630
so that's something that's coming in a

189
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,480
newer version of flawed it's I needed it

190
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,010
in particular for this but eventually I

191
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,330
mean it's one less item you'd have to

192
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,910
patch I do have the patch this is from

193
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,430
oh six I've got that

194
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,320
was a guest I haven't made those

195
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,360
commissioned I did post the the patches

196
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,560
of there are available when I worked

197
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,020
with them when we did the github Fork

198
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,910
so I've been having discussions with me

199
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,810
it's not committed yet and that's

200
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,270
actually one of the things I'm trying to

201
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,950
thought get committed in there so

202
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,300
definitely that would be the ideals to

203
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,250
not have to patch anything just get a

204
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,330
committed because it really it's

205
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,920
completely compatible I can run a

206
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,470
client-side or server-side it's fine so

207
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,890
here's an example so I've got a domain

208
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,530
JSP no de which is where I play with

209
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,880
node stuff and so this example let's see

210
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,840
if I've got it all right so this is

211
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,700
basically just taking ajs Dom example

212
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,770
and converting it or whatever adding a

213
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,750
couple things in so in this example

214
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,590
required just aam give it a base Dom to

215
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,440
work with again production jQuery code

216
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,830
my patched flan and then here's one of

217
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,770
the there's two plugins that as Gamera

218
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,540
was saying the only real remaining

219
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,070
challenge with flawed is that it renders

220
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,250
labels in absolutely position divs so

221
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,600
they're not a part of the canvas and

222
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,730
when you go to do actions like - de -

223
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,650
URL or whatever you now don't have them

224
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,110
so all you would have is a canvas with

225
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,020
lines and fills but nothing to say the

226
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,210
current value is 50 or this is

227
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,700
pertaining to CPU usage or whatever so

228
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,010
there's existing canvas plugins I mean

229
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,950
um flop plugins to get text and this is

230
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,740
a totally unpatched flat plug-in

231
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,410
actually my guess I'll get to it later

232
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,820
but that will be going away at the need

233
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,650
for that is going away soon and then

234
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,440
when it's ready this is just generating

235
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,790
data I would have to do this if I were

236
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,560
showing you how to use flock just make

237
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,450
some random data the only things that

238
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,150
are of any real change are the height

239
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,990
and width that I mentioned earlier and

240
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,940
for that particular plugin it takes a

241
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,120
canvas text argument to grid give it

242
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,520
some information that out with what the

243
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,040
font is to be and then I set clickable

244
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,840
and hoverball to false those are getting

245
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,640
normal flawed options there's no need to

246
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,350
apply any sort of listeners since I'm

247
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,420
going to be returning a static image and

248
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,150
after that um a couple aliases here just

249
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,300
so

250
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,920
I don't have to write window dot jQuery

251
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,350
or window dot dollar in my code create a

252
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,380
sham div this signature right here plot

253
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,350
equals plot div data a completely

254
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,350
standard flock Hall get canvas there's a

255
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,460
normal flop method here I'm getting the

256
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,870
node canvas back which has those

257
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,670
additional methods I haven't defined

258
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,670
where I want to do this output and then

259
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,740
you the create a right stream more

260
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,840
importantly create a PNG stream and then

261
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,480
as it gets data right to that that

262
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:34,100
created jst ang which is back here I

263
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:44,000
think I can do that's what was actually

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:53,810
being written out so going a little bit

265
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,740
deeper I got GS node Jason OD / slot

266
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,570
which is just a way again for me to

267
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,000
experiment with stuff I wanted to do in

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,490
source equals something and get data

269
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,520
back so you can on this particular

270
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,920
whatever instance I have I can actually

271
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,620
pass parameters in via the query string

272
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,670
probably not what you want to do in

273
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,470
production but it's possible so in this

274
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,380
case I can give it a JSON object or just

275
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,240
options or just data so if you give it a

276
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:44,470
list of actions that will give those

277
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,920
right have an issue with that

278
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,140
occasionally weather I don't get there

279
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:55,800
but that is live data so I do use one

280
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,900
Dom in that earlier example I was always

281
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,150
doing require setting up an empty Dom

282
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,460
writing to it there's really no need to

283
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,210
do that so that's a JSON OD slush slots

284
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,890
and Express app so what I do is when I

285
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,900
create when the server is created I do

286
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:15,280
this real basic script injection where

287
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,870
script injection where same things you

288
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,210
saw earlier I just load up the patched

289
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,450
flock and the text plug-in that I need

290
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,130
just to have this there and that does it

291
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,220
one time I then assign window doc canvas

292
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,770
to that canvas that a new canvas item

293
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,930
and same thing I was doing before global

294
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,850
that jQuery equals window dollar so I

295
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,770
can use those later on in the script so

296
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,750
the idea there is that I have one Dom

297
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,930
that I think I'd go to next that when

298
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm actually writing the image ACK all I

299
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,839
ever do is create a jQuery item and it's

300
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,400
always dealing with that one document so

301
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,400
I'm not making multiple documents we're

302
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
making a new one each time because it

303
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,060
just seemed wasteful and it also happens

304
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,430
to work here so this is render flawed

305
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,110
image which is what is used to render

306
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,950
that um jsn Odede slash plot I happen to

307
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,510
get some data create data like you saw

308
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,760
it before I'm just getting rid of that

309
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,500
placeholder equals jQuery I don't even

310
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,029
actually in this example I don't even

311
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,860
throw it a div this seems to be enough

312
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,180
to allow it to work again the standard

313
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,120
plot or flat call signature no canvas

314
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,730
just to remind me that I've got a

315
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,680
enhanced API and now I make a two buffer

316
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,209
which is what gives you this that binary

317
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,610
image and then I just in my response I

318
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,160
give that image back and I'm really I

319
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,779
haven't done enough testing to determine

320
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,180
what effect placeholder has but I

321
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,290
actually decided just to delete

322
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,630
placeholder because it couldn't hurt I

323
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,310
don't know it's working it might clean

324
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,360
memory up for me

325
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,769
I haven't been able to put this thing

326
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:48,089
under enough load to determine if that

327
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,089
has any effect or not

328
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:56,760
so wrapping up advantages big thing

329
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,950
image works everywhere explaining we had

330
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,630
people that wanted a wiki I couldn't do

331
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,589
an iframe on that you've got older

332
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,730
browsers or even current browsers that

333
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,130
don't support canvas Mobile is another

334
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,040
one so or if it's an either a older or

335
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,510
just lower powered I guess through age

336
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,070
or form factor they might not have

337
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,360
support for canvas everything's got

338
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,100
support for image most things you care

339
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,589
about code reuse and this was key with

340
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:24,540
me we had already done work into getting

341
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,220
these charts to look the way that I

342
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,430
wanted and I wanted to quickly get

343
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,769
something up that allowed us to use this

344
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,899
for this client so that was key for nice

345
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:40,079
performance images less burdens again I

346
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,910
mentioned lower power devices instead of

347
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,560
me giving a data structure to the device

348
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,360
having the device constructed and render

349
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,220
it I'm just giving binary image data

350
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,700
back

351
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,529
so there's definitely performance gained

352
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:54,680
on that for some items privacy is huge

353
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,730
in the monitoring service or was

354
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,410
mentioning with some people that just

355
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,640
wanted they want to share their charts

356
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,959
but they wanted to show the relative

357
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,910
change or relative effect they didn't

358
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,970
want to show actual membership database

359
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,829
queries whatever it was and if I was

360
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:09,600
just giving a JSON data structure back

361
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
you can see that in the net request is

362
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,399
possible to off you skate it but you're

363
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,600
one way another you're gonna get it it's

364
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,269
a JavaScript that's coming across here I

365
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:19,709
can make all the changes I want on the

366
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,810
server determine what I want the person

367
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,730
to see and return a completely opaque

368
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,070
image or as a because I want it to be

369
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,600
image back to the client caching now

370
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,750
that you've got a standard HTTP request

371
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,579
you can cache it like you would anything

372
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,769
else let's say you've got something like

373
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,890
sales and you know that if I'm given a

374
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,300
start and an end date and they're both

375
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,250
in the past new sales aren't gonna have

376
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,500
occurred put a far futures header on it

377
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,990
man you can cache it as aggressively as

378
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,699
you would anything else or as you live

379
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,370
that type of data elsewhere I'm side

380
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,630
note I mean if you've tried to ever

381
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,459
cache xhr if you've ever dealt with a

382
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:57,059
304

383
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,179
or of an xhr it's really problematic so

384
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:01,289
three or four says that data hasn't

385
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:02,999
changed ask the server can you give me

386
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,709
the data the service says use what you

387
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:07,169
have the xhr object gives you back empty

388
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:09,959
there's no way to get the data that you

389
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,149
did have before so when you try to do

390
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:14,729
the right thing using xhr if you give a

391
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:17,329
three or four back it's it's

392
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:19,379
debilitating or it's a really depressing

393
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,689
that you can't use that so this allows

394
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,709
me to get around that as well text one

395
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:26,669
of the benefits I guess for having a

396
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:28,139
single platform you know what you have

397
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,509
installed on your server so you can use

398
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:33,539
a certain file this advantages I think

399
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:34,889
the first one being I'm now bringing

400
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:37,379
load from a client back you know that

401
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:39,839
nodes are going from a node back to the

402
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,359
hub so you are taking on some burden but

403
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:45,059
I think you can offset that by some of

404
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:47,429
the things I mentioned caching and etc

405
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:50,249
it's an image a lot of fun stuff done

406
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:53,429
canvas mouse over tooltips expand zoom I

407
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,199
can't do any of that with an image so

408
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,319
clearly that's gone and it's another

409
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,669
piece of technology in your

410
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:01,139
infrastructure you might not be using

411
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,899
node already again that's not too

412
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,459
terrible I mean you can make a request

413
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,019
that goes through a certain port or a

414
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:09,809
certain URL and just send that through

415
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,850
so it's only being run not only that

416
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,289
little bits being run by node you

417
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:14,369
probably have your own image server

418
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,470
anyway that's doing something similar or

419
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,850
if you're doing server-side and

420
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,209
generation you already have that memory

421
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,539
as I said I haven't dealt with enough to

422
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,490
know I'm not seeing it but I know

423
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,319
there's been there was some question

424
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,759
from Elijah if I was running into it

425
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,139
when I showed him what I did he said I

426
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:33,119
should be fine but this is not

427
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,350
thoroughly vetted so I'm not exactly

428
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,230
sure what people would run into with it

429
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,580
don't know of any other said this hasn't

430
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,049
been I didn't get a chance to implement

431
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:42,059
this at the monitoring company it's our

432
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,990
code so I'm not quite sure basic

433
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,820
questions can you do this with Gd or

434
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,389
imagemagick

435
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:50,490
you can but I wanted the same charts

436
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,389
that I already had

437
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:54,240
I like the client-side charting

438
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,559
libraries a lot better I think there's a

439
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,389
lot more development actually going on

440
00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:00,690
in that so it's a lot more there's a lot

441
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,879
more for me to choose from and what I

442
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,769
like is if I find something I like I can

443
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:06,629
just do basically a patch like I showed

444
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:09,210
you before go fine work creates canvas

445
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,669
a little bit out and theoretically

446
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:12,690
that's it or do a little bit more

447
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,820
digging but it's really not that much

448
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,039
work to get a client-side library to

449
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,179
work on the server side

450
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,539
I'm sorry performance I've mentioned not

451
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,399
really sure some flat specific items

452
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,020
actually didn't realize till yesterday

453
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,850
that flat was 7 is out came out about a

454
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,970
month ago so I actually did a patch the

455
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,980
internet issues today I couldn't make my

456
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,049
changes over but it's a similar patch

457
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,669
it's really simple just the line numbers

458
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:36,720
changed enough that I couldn't apply the

459
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,570
same one flat oh wait so there's the

460
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,640
verse Mets an SDN right now is doing all

461
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,830
the rendering or at least doing the

462
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,539
label rendering in text so you don't

463
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,399
even need that plug-in I don't there the

464
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:49,710
tick label rendering in text I don't

465
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,149
think they have labels down yet but

466
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:52,529
that's definitely where they're moving

467
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:55,890
so you would just specify font size fill

468
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,570
etc options and that would be completely

469
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,029
standard which means the new that plugin

470
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:02,700
is gone um

471
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,740
Elijah mentioned note flock I'm pretty

472
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,029
sure he's talking about me there isn't a

473
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:08,250
node flop project I don't know if there

474
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,870
really should be ideally I'd just commit

475
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,520
the stuff back it's a patch file I'm not

476
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,919
trying to fork maintaining this stuff so

477
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,720
hopefully I will submit these if for

478
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,770
whatever reason I can't get them worked

479
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,559
in and I'll make a project which is just

480
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,390
gonna be a patch file right now just got

481
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,380
him up as guests and that's it

482
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,450
does it make any questions I had it no I

483
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,100
haven't sorry the question was have I

484
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,240
ever on Raphael j/s I have not Rafa

485
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,220
exactly so Raphael's SVG which means

486
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,070
that now I did here turn Crocs wrapping

487
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,679
theirs but I did here Raphael shut him

488
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,529
out so I believe it exists somebody we

489
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:47,940
should be able to do the same thing

490
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,880
because Cairo like I said also has SVG

491
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,490
support so if somebody was similarly

492
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,649
motivated or if no Raphael doesn't do we

493
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,120
think it does you should be able to do

494
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
that

495
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:07,840
near portions what's up I don't have her

496
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,980
this the question was is there a service

497
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,130
on WebGL there's a couples the answer

498
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:21,730
from camera I'm sorry

499
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,230
so these are there was a couple that's

500
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:29,170
right ahead soon the one okay thank you
