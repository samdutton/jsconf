1
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,350

I am actually gonna talk about

2
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,590
JavaScript internationalization there's

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,570
not a ton that people are doing on the

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,610
server side right now because a lot of

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,680
that's been figured out a lot of the

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,509
libraries well every library that I'm

7
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:30,220
gonna be talking about works in both

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,220
places so feel free to use any of these

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,070
modules or whatever in in node so

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,769
JavaScript internationalization

11
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:41,290
generally manifesting itself as a web

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,360
app that you're using so yeah that's all

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,230
so about me or about this talk I'm not

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,579
actually that great of a speaker but I

15
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:53,590
talk a lot about beautiful language and

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,750
so that's kind of a cool dichotomy so

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,829
also people think that I can speak

18
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,210
multiple languages because I talk about

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,089
translations and I think that's German

20
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:10,960
for I don't speak other languages so I

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,360
like to say that this is a problem that

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,210
it's a it's a data problem it's a

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,619
presentation it's a template problem

24
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,159
like there's it's not a language

25
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,570
necessarily form you have to understand

26
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,990
the the restrictions and the the things

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,010
that you're set out to solve and you can

28
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,390
solve it without you know knowing a

29
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,770
bunch of languages it helps to know

30
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,060
people who know multiple languages

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,520
though it's quite helpful so this is

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,860
less about internationalization

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,520
specifically and more about user

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,630
experience because really what you're

35
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,060
trying to do is is give users the the

36
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,340
best chance to understand what the heck

37
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,770
you're trying to get them to do but that

38
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,659
in this case turns out to be

39
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,810
international good internationalization

40
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,770
so what we're talking about when we talk

41
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,030
about messages and we talk about

42
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,430
internationalization I'm gonna talk a

43
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,140
lot about the message side of things for

44
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,509
now there's things like right-to-left

45
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,329
and and in quite a few things in

46
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:09,549
internationalization but a lot of the

47
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:11,410
pain that we struggle from these days is

48
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,989
is in message formatting and message

49
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,019
displaying so so you might not think

50
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:19,209
that it comes up much or you might think

51
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:20,680
that it's the same as translating like a

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,379
paragraph or something but it's not so

53
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,959
anytime you're mixing data and a phrase

54
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,870
much like you mix data and a template

55
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,510
and out comes the actual you know markup

56
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,610
for a page that's that's what we're

57
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,209
talking about with messages so you want

58
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:39,400
to consider problems like there are five

59
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,980
results or there are three new messages

60
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,110
or welcome so and so come see why your

61
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,269
score is X or you need X more points

62
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,700
that continue things like that are the

63
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,890
types of sentences that are actually

64
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,530
incredibly difficult to write in a way

65
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,530
that work in every language as much as

66
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,890
as you wouldn't think so things about me

67
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,920
is I like to build JavaScript programs

68
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,690
my mom was English teacher so there's

69
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,540
some background

70
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,420
those are my stats I started out a blog

71
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,579
post called the UX of language with this

72
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,769
tweet and I really liked it as kind of a

73
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,019
base for talking about this kind of

74
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:26,379
stuff it's kind of you tell I favor did

75
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:30,640
it and it's it says web program is the

76
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,989
science of coming up with increasingly

77
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,030
complicated ways of concatenated strings

78
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,549
that's kind of beautiful but that's

79
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,720
really what we're talking about and

80
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,970
really like in the end of the day if you

81
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,440
take about the JavaScript like what you

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,150
see is just a bunch of concatenated

83
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,900
strings so thanks Greg Brockman for

84
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,239
setting me up so I'm gonna give you a

85
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,349
brief history of string concatenates web

86
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,660
was four documents so it's static text

87
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,359
files rolled the web obviously no one

88
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:01,359
was running I term two so that is not

89
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:06,250
the best screenshot but either way there

90
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,650
were documents right and translation was

91
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,090
the translation of documents is no

92
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,680
different than translation had been in

93
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,760
the past some time passes montage video

94
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,039
if you will and people desire to

95
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,739
customize content and this is a huge

96
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,389
shift in the web right it stopped being

97
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,039
like look at this look at this look at

98
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,080
this and it became like here's something

99
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,460
for you and so this was the era of

100
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,470
literally just outputting concatenated

101
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,630
strings so if you remember like cgi-bin

102
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,000
Perl that kind of stuff like yeah line

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,130
endings inside the print statement is

104
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,210
awesome so you

105
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,490
like the original google app so then

106
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,599
after that crappy templates came around

107
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,569
you might recognize a language called

108
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:57,199
personal homepage or PHP hypertext

109
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,009
preprocessor however many levels deep

110
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,620
you want to go and and this is it really

111
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,120
was a template language like they wrote

112
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,039
it as a template language and then just

113
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,280
grew and grew and grew and grew and then

114
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,919
later it became like a actual language

115
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,490
kind of JSP and ASP are similar examples

116
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,610
of this just like write your app and

117
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,650
your your code all in the same line so I

118
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,900
used to write these sweet PHP F so it

119
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,610
was just like the top had like database

120
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,860
access and then it had like the doctype

121
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,169
and then I had some logic for like if it

122
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,630
was a login screen return and was

123
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,090
awesome it was good there's good days so

124
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,070
I call that the nearly 10 years of

125
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,919
string concatenation dark ages and then

126
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,470
around 2004 you started seeing I mean

127
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,030
before you saw but we really came

128
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,270
popular with some of the major NBC

129
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,830
server-side frameworks rails and Django

130
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,300
and that kind of stuff

131
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,590
spring if you will so logicalis

132
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,300
templates came into popularity they're

133
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,639
not necessary but they they became like

134
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,520
a good way to really really D couple you

135
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,169
know apps and and HTML so like 20

136
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,449
something years later we can finally

137
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,930
render HTML all right so what about

138
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,159
render get sentence how is it different

139
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:16,740
so a template sentence so this is

140
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,550
handlebars template I tend to like those

141
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,099
so this seems good welcome to the site

142
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,150
so and so Alex

143
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,889
so we'll try another one hi Alex you

144
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,280
have blank new messages seems good but

145
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,199
it's not good because there's a case

146
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,479
especially even in English right so it's

147
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,130
hi Alex oh you have one new messages and

148
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,289
that and that's bad that's gross

149
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,320
I believe I said so this why this talk

150
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,590
is is considered the the UX of language

151
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,539
we want to avoid situations like that

152
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,210
and it gets much much worse whenever you

153
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,760
start going into other languages that I

154
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,039
don't speak Sark

155
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,389
traditional way of concatenating strings

156
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,789
together isn't sufficient when those

157
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:04,259
strings form a coherent sentence so this

158
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,740
is like a rhetorical question but but

159
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,659
this is this is something that I used to

160
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,490
do and I still find myself doing it's

161
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,960
like when I make my template I make sure

162
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,449
that even when the template runs like

163
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,119
all the brackets line up nicely in like

164
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:20,009
the indented what right like so I spend

165
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,589
time doing that and then I don't

166
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,960
actually have good sentences on my site

167
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,279
so this is the sentence we were we were

168
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,589
talking about earlier you have two new

169
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:34,080
messages so this is this is some of the

170
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,449
ways that we saw this now kind of this

171
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,849
is this is our solutions these are our

172
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:41,520
solutions English so the first one is

173
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,770
just ugly

174
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,020
it works in English it doesn't work in

175
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,789
every language if you have more than one

176
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:49,529
additional way to pluralize something

177
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:51,149
you'd have to have like some or

178
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:55,050
operators in there it gets bad and the

179
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,669
second one is considered prefix and

180
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:58,409
postfix sometimes it works but other

181
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,969
times it's still just it's not very

182
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:02,580
personable if you consider something

183
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,949
like Facebook's application where they

184
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,469
say like Alex x10 and three others like

185
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:10,589
this product that would be really bad if

186
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:13,110
it was like people who like this product

187
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,099
other than alex sexton three so plural

188
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,680
branching is it's really what we want to

189
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,629
end up doing so let's write some code to

190
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,919
to figure out when we want our branch on

191
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,240
the two different strings so in this

192
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,029
case you can you have in English right

193
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:35,190
you say if it's one you have one new

194
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,550
message

195
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,099
and you have two new messages right and

196
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,459
so in Spanish if you're trying to

197
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:42,990
internationalize your app you have a

198
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,029
branch and you say okay now I'll do this

199
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,649
this message in Spanish and this message

200
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,860
in English and that's cool but this is

201
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,690
this really gross it's directly coupled

202
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,529
inside your app code and that gets

203
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,319
really big because here like some

204
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:03,990
commonly supported languages and not all

205
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,540
of them just have to pluralization forms

206
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,420
I think I was feeling

207
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,950
sorry so so a lot of people immediately

208
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,690
say all right Alex like I understand

209
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,820
this is bad I'm internationalize an app

210
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,399
before we use get text in our Python app

211
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,070
or we use get text here and I'll get

212
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,750
back to that that's the next almond

213
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,649
picture it's a good comic but I'll get

214
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:34,410
back to to that so hold your horses so

215
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,600
navigating the the message landscape so

216
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,920
I'll just go into like some of the ways

217
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,070
people are solving this properties files

218
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,760
is something that that often comes up

219
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,089
they're usually just for foreigner

220
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,680
initialization they're not necessarily

221
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,380
for actually like plural forms and

222
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,510
things like that our gender specific

223
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,200
specificity sometimes I'll ask someone I

224
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,310
like this metaphor someone what a friend

225
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,720
of mine gave me it's like I'll ask

226
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,089
someone do you support international

227
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:07,709
strings in your application and they'll

228
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:09,870
say yeah we have properties files which

229
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,320
is the same as saying is this TV

230
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,459
high-definition and someone saying yes

231
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:19,920
it has pixels I mean it's not no it's

232
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,010
just not a guess either right so it's

233
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,020
essentially a set of key values pairs in

234
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,790
this case these properties files are

235
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,300
some objects that I have and it's good I

236
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:39,600
forgot how good at Spanish I was the so

237
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,740
so this is all it is and then whenever

238
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,920
you write your application it just

239
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,770
sticks those strings in so this pretty

240
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,980
calm and you'll see it in Java rails

241
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,450
Django has this kind of stuff pretty

242
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,640
much everybody who's doing translations

243
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,230
you're kind of writing all your messages

244
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,640
in this file you send those off to

245
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,110
translators they send them back and you

246
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,600
switch them out so it doesn't really

247
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,820
address any of the hard problems with

248
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,779
rendering different strings for

249
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,120
different locales other than it renders

250
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,120
one string for for every different

251
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,820
locale let's it's not really what we're

252
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,050
looking for so a lot of times people add

253
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,820
sprint F so though I had one level of

254
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,760
indirection and then they'll put you

255
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,380
know the % deed and say a number goes

256
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,709
here you have blake messages right so

257
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:23,610
that's that

258
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,100
the same case we had before where you

259
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,769
have one messages again but it's better

260
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:30,660
than nothing so you can have data in

261
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,810
there again but you solve old problems

262
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,579
but our templates suck now because you

263
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,250
have two likes printf everything inside

264
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,540
so we can switch our messages and we can

265
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,399
interpolate data into them kind of like

266
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,769
a template but they're incorrectly

267
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,510
pluralized and devoid of gender and

268
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,339
context that's bad

269
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,550
so authoring templates also starts to

270
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,200
suck because you have all this HTML and

271
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,339
you have no context of what you're even

272
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,540
talking about you just have these keys

273
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,579
back to properties files and everything

274
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,350
doesn't look like what you expect it to

275
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,350
look like so go back to Stallman and get

276
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,820
text starts to solve some of this stuff

277
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,660
Pio files are the form of data exchange

278
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,510
that they use there's like the Mozilla

279
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,870
poodle project for translating and

280
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,890
that's P oh oh right so it's it's for P

281
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,079
alpha it's get text I'm sorry

282
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,540
so it decouples the data message which

283
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,790
was really what we want to do so they

284
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,500
got a few things really right and get

285
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,500
text this is like a JSON version of

286
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,029
maybe what a PL file would look like in

287
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,160
JSON you give it a little Cali go to a

288
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,660
plural form and so this is really

289
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,949
important you say I'm defining my

290
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:43,380
indexes for my strings in this plural

291
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,470
form and so in English Orion us up here

292
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,540
my plural form is if it's one return to

293
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,610
zero and if it's to return one or if

294
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,010
it's anything else return one and in

295
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,110
which case you'll grab that index out of

296
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,980
that key so if you notice the those

297
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,959
indexes match up to the correct string

298
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,760
there and then you'll run sprint F on it

299
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,610
and that's that's pretty good solution

300
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,250
so there's different plural form

301
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,930
functions it's it's kind of a C API

302
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,089
because it was written like in 1970

303
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:14,610
something this is the English Proform

304
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,829
splendors Spanish plural form looks

305
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,779
exactly the same French is a little

306
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,279
different zero is kind of like more like

307
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,550
none it's it's a it's translated along

308
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,980
with one so it's that's a singular form

309
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,339
kind of Slovenians crazy I like this one

310
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,660
because because you have like mod 100 in

311
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,149
there at all and I guess it's the

312
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,320
closest

313
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,090
the closest thing I can think of to that

314
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,280
is like in English we have first second

315
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,380
third and then it's 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th

316
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,100
and then when you get to like 21st 22nd

317
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,260
23rd it does it again right and so

318
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,640
Slovenian like that's just the way they

319
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,100
pluralize everything Welsh really sucks

320
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,260
too as far as how many different key

321
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,980
words they have so messages as keys is

322
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,420
another interesting thing that a lot of

323
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,790
people will do at get text so you stick

324
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,760
your whole message in there and you have

325
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,040
you have both you have your default set

326
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,480
in there directly and so in this case

327
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,730
you can see all your possible messages

328
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,070
kind of in line in there and then

329
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,930
they're used as the keys themselves so

330
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,420
then they go back through the get tech

331
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,980
stuff and they can be switched out so

332
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,620
you can kind of see what will eventually

333
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,570
be in there but also you can still have

334
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,180
properties files or Pio files in this

335
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,490
case a lot of people will fuzzy match

336
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,430
these so you can like switch out a comma

337
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,980
without screwing everything up but it's

338
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,780
harder in client-side JavaScript to

339
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,300
fuzzy mesh things so there's there's

340
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,130
quite a few things that the features

341
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,380
that we can do we can kind of hack

342
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,680
gender onto the top but but really what

343
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,710
I want to get to is you still can't do

344
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,260
things like concatenate two separately

345
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,880
translated strings together that never

346
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,300
works

347
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,620
so I like my red shirt can never work

348
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,210
because like languages will switch

349
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,940
things around so because you're implying

350
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,920
an order by doing string concatenation

351
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,530
you can never do string concatenation

352
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,720
you have to always completely translate

353
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,410
a full sentence together so that's

354
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,450
important so we'd get text we can

355
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,020
PluralEyes messages can interpolate

356
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,210
messages we can PluralEyes our message

357
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,520
correctly for each locale so we now have

358
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,310
that capacity we can kind of have

359
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,220
templates with the messages inside of

360
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,850
them good enough maybe we can use gender

361
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,620
specific words if we use context for

362
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,490
gender and it does it does a pretty good

363
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,230
job at most of the things that we need

364
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,570
so get text is used in the in most Linux

365
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,850
projects and Everett like tons and tons

366
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,949
apps use use get text and so it's a

367
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:58,290
pretty good solution so so this is kind

368
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,399
of what some of the reasons why you

369
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,769
might use it so I wrote Jed and I'll

370
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:06,630
probably change the name soon I'll let

371
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:12,089
you know why Jed is the emcee of the

372
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:14,370
other track he's he up until a few

373
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,100
months ago he was a trick translator

374
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,569
that was his full-time job he was just a

375
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,009
hobbyist JavaScript er that just

376
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,569
happened to be better at it than

377
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:24,569
everyone else I guess when you have a

378
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:26,279
hobby it's easier to have fun I don't

379
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:29,040
know he's just good so I named it after

380
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,019
him cuz you don't come across three

381
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,430
character names that often that work so

382
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,930
there's I added kind of a chainable API

383
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,040
for it if you want but you can also use

384
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,089
the old gross see api's and that was

385
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,160
cool so why am I not gonna recommend it

386
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,899
so if we go back to English we can I can

387
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,310
give you a new sentence a new hard one

388
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,769
not too complex there are three messages

389
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:57,600
from two people and so remember you have

390
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,350
to translate these all together and

391
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,750
that's bad because get Tex can only do

392
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,939
one plural so the plural form can take a

393
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:13,709
single input so also I guess the another

394
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,569
problem is if you have context like you

395
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,429
have a menu and you have a footer you

396
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:19,470
want to use that for your context not

397
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,959
genders so you can only go one level

398
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,429
deep on any of their features you can

399
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:24,870
PluralEyes one thing and you have one

400
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,740
context

401
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,440
capi is gross you can fix that yeah you

402
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,820
also have to repeat plural forms you can

403
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,400
get around some of this really there's

404
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,780
quite a bit wrong so norbert Lindenberg

405
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,159
told me about ICU message format

406
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,990
whenever i put that out they actually

407
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,480
kind of crapped all over it and i was

408
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,190
pretty disappointed but they pointed me

409
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,830
towards ICU message format and really

410
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,539
that's just plural format plus select

411
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,390
format IBM I think kind of runs most ICU

412
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,450
and they specify things like

413
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,230
internationalization standards and

414
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,030
things like that there are six key words

415
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,370
that map to different numbers in every

416
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,590
language different polarizations

417
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,450
and then they'll define plural functions

418
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,540
that map to those words this is the

419
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,520
syntax for message format so it's it's

420
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,270
pretty small and so I wrote an

421
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,710
implementation of message format in

422
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,100
JavaScript and so you can see see here I

423
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,410
can switch these out I'm probably too

424
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,270
short on time to do this very often but

425
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,500
I'll do one you can do that and then it

426
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,320
changes as a to messages so it's a take

427
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,590
grammar for describing

428
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,390
internationalization and message

429
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:44,730
situations right so you can have

430
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,310
literals that happen before the the

431
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,410
message format things and those just get

432
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,200
sent in if you don't need multiple

433
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,190
language it doesn't matter you still

434
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,440
need to do this in English right so this

435
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,210
is still a very hard task to do in

436
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,240
English because it's five results in two

437
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,190
categories or one results in two

438
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,230
categories or five results in one

439
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,320
category that gets excessively difficult

440
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,110
and then you had gender and it's he or

441
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,480
she received five results or one results

442
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,580
or one category or two categories and

443
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,660
just explodes and in that same case you

444
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,640
can do multiple plurals just in the same

445
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,060
sentence it's just two separate message

446
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,260
format parts in the sentence and then

447
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,240
you can nest them or you can do select

448
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,880
format for gender and you can get he

449
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,680
found five results in two categories and

450
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,260
I could change any of those and it'll

451
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,430
automatically output the correct string

452
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,260
you have named arguments so this is just

453
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,180
replacements and things like that you

454
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,930
can add plugins

455
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,920
this one's highly readable what this

456
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,590
will do is output every form of Alex

457
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,390
added himself and one other person to

458
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,820
his group it's using an offset plug-in

459
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,310
to say Alex is included in the totals

460
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,960
but he's not included in the other

461
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,730
person in this group so that's why the

462
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,860
plural amount of people is too but it's

463
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,900
just one person that's there so you have

464
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,330
complex plugins to to do strings like

465
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,610
this and this is like straight out of

466
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,680
off of Google's homepage or Facebook's

467
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,260
Google+ all this stuff the only couple

468
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,150
of apps that have decent you know

469
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,660
complex translations its translator

470
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,820
friendly in the sense that everything's

471
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,930
translated together you don't to

472
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,330
translate one sentence that's directly

473
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,920
related to another sentence completely

474
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,840
separately from each other but it's not

475
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,300
translator friendly in that you have to

476
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,800
be a programmer to understand the syntax

477
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,250
at all

478
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,800
so that's message format j/s it's

479
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,500
compiled able so it takes the input free

480
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,910
compile it out to a raw JavaScript

481
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,700
function it uses a parser expression

482
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,960
grammar a lot like ila did this morning

483
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,970
generated a is T and then and then spits

484
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,500
out JavaScript that doesn't even require

485
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,120
the original library so it integrates

486
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,710
directly into handlebars you can write

487
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,570
your messages directly in there it'll

488
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,880
it'll pull all those out compile them it

489
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,580
compiles them just like a template so a

490
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,650
little short on time but I just want to

491
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,900
talk about what the next steps are

492
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,380
tooling is really what's up next so how

493
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,090
do we use how do we get to use these

494
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,030
complex good solutions for translations

495
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,590
and then actually get our things

496
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,380
translated javascript

497
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,480
internationalization still in in the in

498
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,700
the dark ages so it's totally possible

499
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,430
to write good tools around these new

500
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,120
formats and so that's why I'm open

501
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,650
sourcing the JED toolkit which is a

502
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,140
whole family of internationalization

503
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,040
tools both libraries and like actual web

504
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,080
apps and api's

505
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,420
that you can set up in a stack to help

506
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,490
translators and do all this stuff so

507
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,660
it's tools and libraries

508
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,960
I want developers to be happy on a kill

509
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,330
like the two-month code freeze for the

510
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,790
translation time I want to automate

511
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,930
sending strings to translators and make

512
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,900
their translation experience much better

513
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,730
I have Jed toolkit org that you could

514
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,250
visit there's a picture of him we can

515
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,490
click on that and then I'll be done but

516
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,920
I'd love to talk oh he's down there

517
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,370
there he is so I'd love to talk about

518
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,310
how that web app works with a bunch of

519
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,020
people I've been working with some of

520
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,360
the major translation companies on

521
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,220
getting them to be able to use these

522
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,290
apps

523
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,240
as their translations kind of spot

524
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,560
because they're still using tools from

525
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,270
like the 70s and Word documents and

526
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,460
things like that and FTP file uploads

527
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,740
it's a terrible terrible world it's like

528
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,990
20 years behind every other place we are

529
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,840
so we can really really bring the

530
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,610
tooling for internationalization up to

531
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,250
par with the tooling that we have for

532
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,570
automated builds and testing and all

533
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,920
that kind of stuff and we'll be in a lot

534
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,500
better place I probably don't have time

535
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,080
for questions I'd guess but maybe one

536
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:05,000
all right one question do you handle it

537
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,120
any rtl stuff RTL I've been saving the

538
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,640
thing with RTL and I had to do one RTL

539
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,600
app is that so far as I can tell there's

540
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,020
no solution to RTL other than look at

541
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,390
everything individually all by itself

542
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,400
with someone who speaks those languages

543
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,260
a hundred times like there if someone

544
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,000
can create something that's awesome for

545
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,460
that I will totally help you but I don't

546
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,680
have that idea yet RTL is very difficult

547
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,020
