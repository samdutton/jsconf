00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,290

thank you very much so yes I'm going to

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,770
talk and kind of build on some of our

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,230
our themes that have been emerging today

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,449
a little bit about how we go about

5
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,730
participating and so this is either a

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,189
really design focused technical talk or

7
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,340
a very technical design talk

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,450
choose-your-own-adventure here that's

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,079
just fine so I do spend a lot of time

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,149
playing around with variable thoughts I

11
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,050
have since day since they launched and

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,520
one of the recurring themes for me is

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,620
this notion of participation meeting

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,690
people from different browser vendors

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,920
different different font companies and

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,379
trying things experimenting and

17
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,800
providing feedback and so for me as a

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,350
designer and a developer who's worked on

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,390
the web for actually 25 years and my web

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,740
career is probably older than half the

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,189
people here but that that has led me to

22
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,990
be able to participate more than I ever

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,810
have before just by speaking up just by

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,490
going and commenting on issues and

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,110
trying things out and providing some use

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,790
cases and I'll show you some of those

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,970
things today really most people just

28
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,500
know me as a walker of these two so

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,180
they're gonna come back and help me kind

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,680
of explain a couple things but so I

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,570
spend most of my time working on type

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,490
and typography and design systems and

33
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,409
and for browser vendors and that sort of

34
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,049
thing writing content about it trying to

35
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,329
educate people about it but I've had

36
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,939
people in Australia ask me first how

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,490
Tristan's doing so that's Tristan on the

38
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,020
left and it's his cousin Tillie on the

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,570
right and they'll be back to explain

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,460
some things later on so the reason why I

41
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,860
think this stuff is so important there's

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,420
there's lots of reasons for performance

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,280
and everything else but type is the

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,469
voice of our words it's how we hear what

45
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,629
we read and and so all of the tech stuff

46
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,099
fixing performance problems with font

47
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:11,860
loading

48
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,350
that's the Gateway to actually get in

49
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,210
and do better typography in the first

50
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,660
place and this is one of the reasons why

51
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,850
so when this quote came across I was

52
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,560
like the day before I was giving this

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,450
the first version of this talk for the

54
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,750
first time and and I had to work this in

55
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,240
because I think Nina's notion of

56
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,090
friction in design what creates that

57
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,850
interface between what I put on screen

58
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,430
and what you read that's what makes it

59
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,650
memorable and sometimes you want more

60
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,810
friction sometimes you want less butt

61
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,880
type is the way we can modulate that and

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,470
I think that's really fascinating so

63
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,210
what I want to look at is actually

64
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,040
combining several different CSS

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,010
techniques to create more interesting

66
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,250
and fluid typography and then we can

67
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,410
also tie in some other emerging features

68
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,720
that will help make that typography more

69
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,250
interesting and more useful in more

70
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,730
scenarios to more people so there's

71
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,990
three things that we're going to talk

72
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,940
about primarily and that is CSS custom

73
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,459
properties or variables the ability to

74
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,950
do calculations with them and pairing

75
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,010
that with variable fonts so variable

76
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,540
fonts I hope is something that you've

77
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,420
all at least heard about but if not I'm

78
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,920
gonna explain a little bit more about

79
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,170
what they are in a minute so looking at

80
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,310
what we have on screen

81
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,530
I thought the Odyssey might be a good

82
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,690
way to talk about the way our journey on

83
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,450
the web has evolved and I wanted to try

84
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,010
and present it in a slightly different

85
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,300
way so we have a heading and instead of

86
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,310
assigning it in an explicit color we

87
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,170
could sign it a variable for that color

88
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,510
so we might change it later on and and I

89
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,100
think that will have some interesting

90
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,420
use cases for that and so this is

91
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,860
totally not showing things properly

92
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,560
sorry okay

93
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,510
that's what it's supposed to look like

94
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,400
and so we have the color assigned and we

95
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,049
want to start to change those things so

96
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,000
we changed that variable assignment and

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,860
so now we have a different color heading

98
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,530
we might also want to do a calculation

99
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,620
on the size so that we could then change

100
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,770
that base size later on as we start to

101
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,350
scale it on different screen sizes so

102
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,290
we've now done things

103
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,330
changed the size and that actually

104
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,770
altered the flow of the text a little

105
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,380
bit so we might want to actually assign

106
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,690
a variable to the weight as well so as

107
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,940
size changes we might impact that so

108
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,560
here's where the variable fonts come in

109
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,650
so we have that single asset that we can

110
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,870
then use in a greater variety of ways

111
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,350
and this is actually where I want to

112
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,600
pause for just a second and bring up the

113
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,940
idea about when we read advice about

114
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,520
things we do on the web we need to think

115
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,500
about why that advice exists in the

116
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,040
first place

117
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,110
so I see a lot of people writing about

118
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,020
what is good typography and a lot of

119
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,460
people will talk about and these are our

120
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,040
experienced designers and we'll talk

121
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,380
about good typography being only using

122
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,470
two weights of a font that's actually

123
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,030
not good typography at all that's

124
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,730
convenient for performance and that has

125
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,760
been sort of codified as a way we should

126
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,940
do things because of the reality of how

127
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,100
we serve things on the web so it makes

128
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,660
for a better user experience if you get

129
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,130
content on screen and you're only

130
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,050
loading two assets that's a smaller

131
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,730
amount of data so that makes sense but

132
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,740
that's not actually good typography a

133
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,140
single weight of a typeface as you

134
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,210
change it in size will become more or

135
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,340
less clear and easy to read if you can

136
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,080
modulate that weight a little bit at

137
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,660
every different size you'll get clearer

138
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,660
and more legible type so there's reasons

139
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,190
why we might want to do this sort of

140
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,440
thing and I also wanted to show that

141
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,480
some of these ideas work equally well in

142
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,400
the context of a design system so it's

143
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,890
not something that is purely for one

144
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,040
block long form copy but when we take

145
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,690
this thing and we've got our card so I

146
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,160
don't have a box around it but you know

147
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,050
cards are a theme we know we are gonna

148
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,600
use sub-grid on them and everything and

149
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,980
we have them here in the bottom part of

150
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,420
the layout but if we stick them over on

151
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,030
the side maybe we scope the change in

152
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,610
size or scale of that typography to

153
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,910
where it's placed in the layout so again

154
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,640
we don't have to write any new markup

155
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,830
all we have to do is tweak some of those

156
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,100
size variables and that can be dependent

157
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,420
upon where things are placed and that's

158
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,030
really kind of interesting but let me

159
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,310
come back to variable fonts because one

160
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,020
of the things that I've learned is every

161
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,460
time I think I've been rattled

162
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,500
about them enough I'll go to another

163
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,180
event and people don't actually know

164
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,330
what they really look like so when you

165
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,639
load fonts you typically have a whole

166
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,139
bunch of different files that you need

167
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,639
to load in order to get all the

168
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,080
different weights and variants whether

169
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,509
it's with weight italics all that sort

170
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,030
of thing but a variable font actually

171
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,680
brings all of that together in a single

172
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,500
file so now you're loading one asset

173
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,660
which is bigger than a single static

174
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,180
file but not so big as what you want to

175
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,000
combine and it gives you then access to

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,759
the whole range of that set of weights

177
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,699
or widths all at once rather than having

178
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,910
only one or two so Tristan and Tilly

179
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,190
again will help me out where we have

180
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,009
variable size collies and you can have

181
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,690
that single font file that you're

182
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,280
loading and then playing around with all

183
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,400
these different characteristics and I

184
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,710
hope you'll pay attention to some of the

185
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,240
classes that have been applied here to

186
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,860
make sure that we're really focused in

187
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,949
on exactly what we're talking about and

188
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,680
these axes are ones that are chosen to

189
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,900
be exposed by the type designer they're

190
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,520
not distortions introduced by the

191
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,740
browser they're only what is native

192
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,470
inside the font itself so you'll see a

193
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,770
lot of different variable axes exposed

194
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,479
and and we're still kind of learning

195
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,430
what some of those axes might be but the

196
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,080
more common ones that will be useful to

197
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,979
us for you I particularly will be things

198
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,930
like width and weight it just creates a

199
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,330
lot more opportunity but we also don't

200
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,919
want to forget that we also have slit

201
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,440
now we have all of these things

202
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,289
available to us but one of the things

203
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,419
that is often overlooked in a responsive

204
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,550
design is how that typographic scale

205
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,310
needs to move and change based on screen

206
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,620
size so when you have a small screen you

207
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,570
have less distraction and less space for

208
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,370
that content to show up so you don't

209
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,349
really want to have the same scale

210
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,229
between heading and body copy on a big

211
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,260
screen and a small one so when you have

212
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,810
an h1 that's still appropriately sized

213
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,490
do you understand that that's the title

214
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,719
it's the most important piece of

215
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
information on the screen we're going to

216
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,690
start to scale this using all of these

217
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,050
things together we're going to set

218
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,630
a bunch of variables for breakpoints and

219
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,930
minimum and maximum sizes for in this

220
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,810
case the paragraph size and line height

221
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,459
and so these are the things that we're

222
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:02,230
going to move around and scale based on

223
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,060
that screen size rather than using

224
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,550
explicit breakpoints to change things

225
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,560
all the way along we're going to start

226
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,060
to do this a little bit differently

227
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,019
we're going to use some of these

228
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:15,130
calculations so as it changed what

229
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,529
happened there was the font size and the

230
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,209
line height started to change with it

231
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,089
and so as the screen got bigger we

232
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:24,399
started to use stuff like this and I

233
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,670
know that's a lot somebody who's Greg

234
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,730
from the edge edge team last night said

235
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,589
are you gonna put that really stupidly

236
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:34,360
long formula up on the screen and I said

237
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,390
yes yes I am multiple times but I'll

238
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,640
explain it so this is kind of what's

239
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,310
going on and this is based on a

240
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,899
technique that Tim Brown wrote about

241
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,980
awhile ago called CSS locks now some of

242
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,510
you have probably played around with

243
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,760
viewport width units to size text and

244
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
that's really interesting and it helps

245
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,899
you size text based on the size of the

246
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,910
window but it has a couple of problems

247
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,860
and Estelle while was the first person

248
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,380
that pointed out to me that when you use

249
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,320
purely viewport units to size text you

250
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,120
can't zoom it so you've created this

251
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,339
huge accessibility problem because it's

252
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:11,829
based on the window not page zoom so

253
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:14,589
when you calculate it and introduce

254
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:17,230
another unit of measure the end result

255
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,779
can still be zoomed so that alleviates

256
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,209
the accessibility issue but you also

257
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:24,160
want to stop it from getting too small

258
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,500
or too big so this is where the lochs

259
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,200
idea comes in you can assign a minimum

260
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,020
and maximum size and then tie it to

261
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,730
different break points so that it will

262
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,680
get no smaller when it's on a very small

263
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,329
screen and no bigger when it's on a very

264
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,040
large screen and it gives you a little

265
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,709
bit more control without having to worry

266
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,390
about everything in the middle so

267
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,320
effectively you're still using

268
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,089
breakpoints but only at the low end and

269
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,649
high end of where you want it to start

270
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,750
and stop scaling and so this is what it

271
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,420
looks like in story form so please take

272
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,940
this item and scale it from this size up

273
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,160
to this size starting at this screen

274
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,520
size and ending at that one so we start

275
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,990
to replace these values in the formula

276
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,160
gets a little bit simple

277
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,810
and this is about the point where I

278
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,220
throw my hands up and walk away because

279
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,029
browsers are better at math than I am I

280
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:11,170
didn't really take any college math

281
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,750
either so that's as this is as far as I

282
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,079
go

283
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,579
but browsers are really good at it and

284
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,230
that's fine and you don't ever have to

285
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,329
rewrite it so I use that exact same

286
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,459
formula I've taken that around from

287
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:23,860
dozens of different demonstrations and

288
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,930
workshops it's in production in several

289
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,250
different websites a couple of which

290
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,069
I'll show you later on and we're then

291
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:34,600
going to see how that actually looks in

292
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,639
the real world so we take all these

293
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,639
things and we put them together and

294
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,230
instead of having only a couple of

295
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,149
things happening we're actually going to

296
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,790
tailor a whole bunch of things here the

297
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,430
width of the text the weight of it the

298
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,500
size the line height all of those things

299
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,959
are going to scale nicely as we go from

300
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,750
small screen to large and now why might

301
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,079
we want to do that on small screens we

302
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:01,779
have fairly choppy line lengths when you

303
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,759
have the text size set at a good

304
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,449
readable 100% size so rather than make

305
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:10,389
the body text smaller we could make it a

306
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:12,579
tiny bit narrower if you have a width

307
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,500
axis and that will fit more characters

308
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,029
per line and give you a little bit more

309
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:18,550
even reading experience without really

310
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,939
sacrificing the legibility so we're

311
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,800
doing a whole bunch of other stuff we're

312
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,100
setting variables not only for the size

313
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,600
and line height but we're also setting

314
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,939
it for width and we're doing the same

315
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:34,480
kind of thing as we scale you'll notice

316
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,220
that not only what's going to change

317
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,730
here is the width the weight and as well

318
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,009
as the line height and the size as the

319
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,769
scales so it's appropriate for the

320
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,600
device size it gives you a good clear

321
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,059
reading experience optimized for the

322
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,680
size of the screen upon which it's

323
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,630
viewed and that's really important

324
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,699
because content is will whole point of

325
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,949
what we're putting on screen unless it's

326
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:00,490
a game or the kittens the kittens should

327
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,620
just be at a hundred percent right well

328
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,990
dogs not cats anyway so here's another

329
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,209
example of this in action so this is a

330
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,980
page that I designed for monotypes

331
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,279
introduction of

332
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,189
the FF meta is their first variable font

333
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:19,100
lunch and so this is just an embed

334
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,500
that's a real real web page all the

335
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,180
stuff that you're seeing here our actual

336
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,920
production fonts or most of the

337
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,970
reproductions some of them are

338
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,819
open-source but everything that's on the

339
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:33,800
screen here is from one file so a single

340
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,560
font file 84k replaces 18 separate files

341
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,170
to pre create this beautiful range of

342
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,589
typography now I say beautiful range I'm

343
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:47,540
not saying beautiful typography I happen

344
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,399
to like it but I don't want to imply

345
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,889
that that judgment is absolute and so

346
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,569
that also moves and scales really nicely

347
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,399
so this is using a lot of the same ideas

348
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,209
on the slightly earlier iteration but it

349
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,949
doesn't have the width but it does

350
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:06,160
create an interesting layout and

351
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,779
solution-based appropriately for the

352
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,829
screen size that it's on this is another

353
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:14,959
quote from Tim Brown because I think

354
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,819
this is really important and this is a

355
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:19,790
theme that I've seen emerging at a bunch

356
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,649
of events in different talks this year

357
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:24,649
where we need to remember that we're not

358
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:27,040
dictating the experience to the user

359
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,170
we're giving them an experience which

360
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,709
they can then choose to take or not and

361
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,850
they can override it with user

362
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,559
preference they can override it with

363
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,230
page zoom and increasingly we want to be

364
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,629
mindful that we should give them the

365
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:44,029
ability to fine-tune that experience

366
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:46,790
based on their needs it might be ambient

367
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,329
light it might be low vision it could be

368
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:53,240
different kinds of cognitive issues that

369
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,779
made that they may face so why not use

370
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:59,540
CSS and a little bit of JavaScript so

371
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,160
I'll include everybody from tomorrow and

372
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,620
Sunday as well that we can improve this

373
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,199
experience with a few simple things to

374
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:09,110
give people the choice about how they

375
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,019
want to take in this content so one of

376
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:14,120
the things that has become pretty

377
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,639
popular as the idea of using light and

378
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,059
dark mode so it's built into a lot of

379
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:23,059
different operating systems now it's

380
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:25,910
oddly enough not available in iOS and I

381
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,209
was

382
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,740
kind of surprised about that but it does

383
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,279
work it's shipping now the respect for

384
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,809
that in a media query is built into

385
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,490
Safari and Firefox and if it's not

386
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,339
shipping yet in chrome it's just about -

387
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,649
it does work if you have a flag set it's

388
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,589
it's working in my browser anyway and so

389
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:48,829
if I wanted to just pop over to my

390
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:57,410
system preferences and go back here it's

391
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,949
under general and if I just select dark

392
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:04,939
mode I didn't change anything in the

393
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:07,429
code I just have a few things in a media

394
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:09,709
query so that if the user has set that

395
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,809
preference I can invert a couple of

396
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:14,420
things and it's really easy to do based

397
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,970
on the absence or presence of these

398
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,649
variables so inside the media query here

399
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,649
prefers color scheme dark then all I

400
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:27,279
have to do is replace a couple of

401
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,379
different values for those variables and

402
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,059
it just inverts the whole color palette

403
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,160
and as an experiment I added this to my

404
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,319
own website last week and it took me

405
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,740
about 20 minutes to go through and find

406
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,079
all the places where I needed to swap

407
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,299
out those variables so it's actually was

408
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,490
kind of an incredibly easy thing to do

409
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:52,549
and if I go back here what I want to do

410
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:54,230
is actually I cheated a little bit I

411
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,389
have a class on here as well but watch

412
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,850
what happens when I enable the dark mode

413
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,429
I'm also increasing the grade of the

414
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,529
text slightly that's another variable

415
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,720
axis so it increases the weight subtly

416
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,880
without shifting the space around the

417
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,569
letterforms

418
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,370
and I also increase the letter spacing

419
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,679
so a couple of small tweaks to the

420
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,439
typography using basic CSS and this and

421
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,870
the variable axis creates that better

422
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,360
more tailored reading experience in that

423
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,980
inverted light mode which for some

424
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,899
people is the difference between being

425
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:27,529
able to use the computer and not so it

426
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,899
really does give us to try and and make

427
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,750
sure these things are available so going

428
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,880
back here there are other cases where we

429
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,590
might increase grade of text and this

430
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,360
for people that have either low ambient

431
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,530
lights

432
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,780
or they have low vision meaning they

433
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,120
need a little bit stronger contrast in

434
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,250
order to make out that fine detail well

435
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,350
again we can tie into without inverting

436
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,510
the color mode we can still create a

437
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,400
slightly more readable experience we'll

438
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
go back and forth a little bit there you

439
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,380
can see I'm doing the same kind of thing

440
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,810
like increasing the grade opening up the

441
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,490
letter space in just a little bit it

442
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,650
creates a more legible experience for

443
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,630
someone that that needs that extra

444
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,850
little touch we can also play around

445
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,180
with font size so again we can in this

446
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,130
case all I had to do is redefine the

447
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,930
scaling values the low and the high end

448
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,910
and then everything else kind of moves

449
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,420
along with it we can also do things like

450
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,820
address crowding crowding is a

451
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,310
particular subset it's a condition that

452
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,530
a subset of people that have dyslexia

453
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,090
suffer from and actually learned about

454
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,590
this from Kevin Larsen from Microsoft

455
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,150
advanced reading group did a really

456
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,300
great talk about this research and what

457
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,880
they found was that in people who suffer

458
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,440
from crowding and it's it's not

459
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,720
everybody with dyslexia it's a subset

460
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,550
what they discovered was that if you

461
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,590
could increase the word spacing and line

462
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,070
height they could increase reading

463
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:56,300
cognition by 50% that's a massive

464
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,190
increase for people that is again the

465
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,780
difference between getting something

466
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,480
from your site and not it's opening and

467
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,030
closing a door to people to learning to

468
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,660
experience to entertainment you name it

469
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,320
with really simple stuff so again word

470
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,930
spacing line height modify those two

471
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,790
variables make it easy

472
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,590
put these controls in the hands of the

473
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,220
user so what that might that look like

474
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,690
well if we could actually just put a

475
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,370
little panel off to the side on our

476
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,800
website and all it does is toggle some

477
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,750
classes on and off that will trigger

478
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,180
those little bits of CSS we can then

479
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,690
again put it in the hands of the user

480
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,120
allow them to control that experience it

481
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,980
doesn't take much time for us the net

482
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,680
cost in a project is zero I'm not

483
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,120
kidding I mean like this is a tiny

484
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,090
amount of effort to put in across the

485
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,310
scope of a whole project that will then

486
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,010
make the difference between I can use

487
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,760
this site

488
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,669
or I need to go somewhere else and we

489
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:57,110
want people to be able to use our sites

490
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,030
so I think it's really important that we

491
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,720
keep that sort of thing in mind and the

492
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,520
other thing that we might do again

493
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,080
because this is a lot of effort to

494
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,540
create great typography we want to be

495
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,610
able to reuse this effort as much as as

496
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,090
we can we can then extend it a little

497
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,309
bit more to make the whole system itself

498
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:19,549
Thema ball so we could actually use this

499
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:22,070
stuff over and over on other projects by

500
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,750
using a variable for the font stack

501
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,080
itself so as this stuff moves around in

502
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,040
scales we could also based on grid

503
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,549
placement we can actually shift around

504
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,380
what values we apply but we could also

505
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,010
change the entire look itself and that

506
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,900
might be by just adding a few more

507
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,360
variables that are tied to the font

508
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,490
stack that we enable which one is

509
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,610
primary and then tie things to screen

510
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,799
size light modes all different kinds of

511
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,720
things that we might be able to do but

512
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,600
that makes this whole system a series of

513
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,820
files we could drop into any project so

514
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,950
that you know we want efficiency we want

515
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,600
to work in design systems we want to be

516
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,049
able to replicate all this stuff then we

517
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:07,940
want to be able to get the most out of

518
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,710
it that we can so we figure this stuff

519
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,480
out in a system we take it from one

520
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,520
project to the next I can tell you from

521
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,990
experience now over the last couple

522
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,090
years that it has saved me a ton of time

523
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,429
and it has enabled me to bring all this

524
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:21,410
into a production system for one of the

525
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,230
larger states in the u.s. so that brings

526
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,070
me to this georgia gov and I was asked

527
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,809
to come in and work on the typographic

528
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:32,900
system for all of their state agency

529
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,790
websites so this is one platform one

530
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,730
pattern lab instance in Drupal and we

531
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,919
were able to take all of the ideas that

532
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,570
I've been showing you and build that

533
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,669
into this whole system and so we have

534
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,740
everything here so this is the this is

535
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,809
an actual copy of the pattern lab that

536
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,360
exists for all of the sites and if I go

537
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,700
play around with all of this you can see

538
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,370
the scaling happening live everything

539
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,230
it's all the same kind of math

540
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,390
I'm using app supports it's delivering

541
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,210
static web fonts for ie11 variable fonts

542
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,910
for everybody else so that's another

543
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,460
little plug there the browser support

544
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,800
for variable fonts every shipping

545
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,980
browser I 11 still does not support it

546
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,810
so that is a reality but using ass

547
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,300
supports in your CSS will enable you to

548
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,700
bring this into your project safely and

549
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,250
use it in production and it's actually

550
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,140
not that hard to do to add in a block

551
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,900
that just redefines the variables font

552
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,350
support and just layer it into your the

553
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,780
rest your project so they've just

554
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,430
started launching these sites we've been

555
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,130
working on this for the last eight nine

556
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,130
months or so and so now they've got a

557
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,050
couple of different live websites that

558
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,490
it's all in Drupal so they've got lots

559
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,050
of flexibility to build the different

560
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,180
content types but they've actually

561
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,890
started to roll this out now and this

562
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,930
will be powering 80 to 100 websites

563
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,540
across the entire state of Georgia so it

564
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,060
is very much production-ready it's

565
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:06,350
really nice to see and they're not the

566
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,800
only people doing this so IBM fairly

567
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,540
large company I'm guessing most of you

568
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,610
have heard of them they just released

569
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,560
Plex sans a couple years ago and is a

570
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,660
beautiful family of typefaces that they

571
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,280
made open source and that's core to

572
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,830
their entire identity well it so happens

573
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,930
just about a month ago they released a

574
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,860
variable font version of blech sans 16

575
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,220
files totalled 960 K in a weight range

576
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,640
from 85 to 100 percent weight range of

577
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,980
with range from 85 to 100 a weight range

578
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,940
from 100 to 700 and italics so all of

579
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,760
that stuff replaced with two files at

580
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,210
233 K now you might think that's still a

581
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,000
lot to load in font data but it's

582
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,550
cashable and it gives you an incredible

583
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,380
range of stuff and it's a hugely

584
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,420
internationalized font so if you were to

585
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,610
localize it just for say Latin one

586
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,650
extended you'd bring down the number of

587
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,150
glyphs in there and you'd have an even

588
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,820
smaller file so you get a tremendous

589
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,000
amount out of that and I just want to

590
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,010
show I know other people

591
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,870
have been kind of carrying on about the

592
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,060
Firefox dev tools but man they are so

593
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,570
cool so one of the things that I know

594
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,710
you're not going to be able to read that

595
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,970
that's okay the font panel so I'm gonna

596
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,070
actually get out of this mode so you can

597
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,500
actually see it on screen here so if I

598
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,770
exit my full screen and inspect this

599
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,910
again what I want to show you is I have

600
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,740
selected that first line of text and if

601
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,380
you look at the font panel over here

602
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,160
you'll see that it shows you what font

603
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,750
has been selected and what's what's

604
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,180
enabled there it gives you the basics of

605
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,860
size and line height and whether or not

606
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,860
it has italics or not but it will also

607
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,960
expose the any available axes in the

608
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,850
variable font so in this case we've got

609
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,940
width and weight and I can now play

610
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,150
around with that live in the browser so

611
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,920
this comes up a lot when I'm working

612
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,660
with both designers and developers who

613
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,340
have to work together this is a

614
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,950
conversation facilitator this allows a

615
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,470
designer to go into the browser and look

616
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,450
at a test harness of a page or an

617
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,660
existing existing mock-up or early

618
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,110
iteration or maybe a build in a PR and

619
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,850
play around with the type get things

620
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,900
exactly the way they want it and then

621
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,200
they can just click on the changes tab

622
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,160
there's another really awesome little

623
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,730
tidbit in in Firefox dev tools this is

624
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,440
where all of the changes that you've

625
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,140
just made in the inspector are going to

626
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,940
show up so then you can just copy that

627
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,860
and hand it back to the developer and

628
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,810
say here so if you can't code it

629
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,220
yourself or if you just want to use

630
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,720
these shortcuts to kind of play with

631
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,610
things and then you can always see

632
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,440
everything that you've changed font

633
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,080
values padding alignment all of these

634
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,010
different things that you've been

635
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,080
playing around with this is where it

636
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,150
accumulates so then you can figure out

637
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,830
everything that you've changed which is

638
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,860
just really fantastic so that's my plug

639
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,650
for Firefox dev tools and and I will do

640
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,380
want to say out loud that people from

641
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,440
both chrome and the edge team have

642
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,570
approached me and had conversations with

643
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,300
me this week about wanting to improve

644
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:24,509
the

645
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:26,159
and other browsers as well so

646
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,320
competition is good people really do

647
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,849
care about this stuff you're gonna see

648
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:31,649
more of these incredible tools coming

649
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:33,329
from different browsers as well and

650
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:34,919
that's just going to make our design

651
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,139
life that much better so big round of

652
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,820
applause to the dev tools teams that all

653
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,470
the browsers

654
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:46,850
[Applause]

655
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,760
one more thing as part of my work with

656
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,090
the w3c what we've been chartered with

657
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,220
right now is something that's really new

658
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,710
and I want it's it's still a year two

659
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,960
away before it ships but this is a bit

660
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,700
of a tease because it's so important

661
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,500
about font performance in the first

662
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,910
place that I wanted to give you a little

663
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,330
advance preview what we're working on is

664
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,940
something called progressive font

665
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,430
enrichment and don't worry I've got a

666
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,730
link to a noticed page that has all of

667
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,380
this stuff on it with tons of links and

668
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,510
resources so you'll easily be able to

669
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,850
kind of check all of this stuff out but

670
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,910
this demo is live on the web so this is

671
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,790
real stuff that I'm showing you and we

672
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,880
have the ability to take a look I'm

673
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,270
gonna choose a variable font where'd it

674
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,980
go

675
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,210
this is there it is sorry

676
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,670
and so the idea is we want to be able to

677
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,290
download only the amount of font

678
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,540
information that you need to render the

679
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,840
page rather than having to do this on an

680
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,090
every page basis we want it to be

681
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,490
cumulative so you look at the first page

682
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,190
of your website and it downloads the 47

683
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,140
glyphs of font data that are required to

684
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,180
render that page when you go to the next

685
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,330
page it might only require 12 more so we

686
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,830
want to rather than throw these things

687
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,960
out we're talking about dynamically sub

688
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,460
setting the font but then building it

689
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,680
back up in the browser and that's really

690
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,350
kind of incredible

691
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,570
yes well just wait till you see it in

692
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:21,990
action

693
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,540
so I'm just gonna copy the first two

694
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,250
paragraphs and this is this is a long

695
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,010
page there's a lot of text here this is

696
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,540
the entire first book of the Odyssey so

697
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,650
I'm gonna take the first two paragraphs

698
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,870
and go back over here and I'm making a

699
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,820
couple of choices about which sub

700
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,510
setting tools this is this is a totally

701
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,650
experimental thing this is basically

702
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,690
here for us to test research while we're

703
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,110
working on the specification and I

704
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,390
pasted those two paragraphs in I add

705
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,890
them here's my demo content

706
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,200
there's what's happening so there's the

707
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,049
full font would be 21 K that's what

708
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:04,679
would get sent today with that font and

709
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,640
what was served for this page is down on

710
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,740
the incremental transfers line see so

711
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,299
it's a third one down that was six and a

712
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:15,100
half K was the only amount of font data

713
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,429
that was sent so that's you know almost

714
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:22,330
25 percent or so instead of 100% of the

715
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,880
font file so let's go back and grab the

716
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,950
whole rest of this first book so I'm

717
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,200
gonna select here go all the way down to

718
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,679
the bottom so I'm selecting a whole lot

719
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,590
of text but let's see what that does in

720
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,389
terms of the different number of glyphs

721
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:40,539
so I've copied that I'm gonna go in here

722
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:50,380
add this and here we go 3.7 K so still

723
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,840
even with all of that text we're only

724
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,110
serving half of the whole font file now

725
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,269
this is peanuts when you're looking at

726
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:01,210
wet western languages this is not where

727
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,830
it matters although it's still going to

728
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,450
improve things when we talk about those

729
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,980
variable fonts think about that one from

730
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,190
IBM instead of 233 K we might be serving

731
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,630
12 but think about Arabic typical Arabic

732
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,299
font could be two and a half Meg's or

733
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:18,610
something in CJK Chinese Japanese or

734
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,070
Korean that might be 16 Meg's or might

735
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,200
be 20 so again this is the difference

736
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,500
between being able to use it and not and

737
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,750
the font directly relates to readability

738
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,029
so system fonts are fine but they may

739
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,590
not be the most legible or the most

740
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,269
appropriate so web fonts really are

741
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:37,179
important and this is why we want to

742
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:39,370
make sure that we have these kinds of

743
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,440
things available again this is

744
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,840
participatory this will all be going as

745
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,370
soon as we have enough research here

746
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,169
it's gonna be all on github everybody

747
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:50,169
gets to comment everyone gets to test

748
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:54,630
things and participate so this is why

749
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,399
it's such an exciting time to be working

750
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,799
on the web because it's easier for all

751
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,659
of us to participate than it ever has

752
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,820
been so that was what I wanted to show

753
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,830
you with this demo bit here

754
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,850
so I'll speed past those again I wanted

755
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,980
to give you access to things so there's

756
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,809
lots of different variable fonts that I

757
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:16,179
used in this presentation and where you

758
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:17,919
can find them some of them are open

759
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,899
source some of them are commercial some

760
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:22,600
of them are some data but if you want to

761
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,100
take a picture grab this last one that

762
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,440
linked down on the bottom has all of

763
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,509
this stuff available and you can also

764
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:30,369
sign up for an email newsletter that I

765
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:33,039
do every week about web typography where

766
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,279
a lot of these conversations start and

767
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,110
thank you very much

768
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,460
[Applause]
