00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,990

hi everybody I hope you're enjoying the

2
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,599
conference so far it's been great I've

3
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,980
never spoken to an audience of fish

4
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,140
before so that's the first it's pretty

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,610
awesome so I I'm gonna introduce myself

6
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,900
briefly a bit as well I'm Lia I if

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,220
you've ever heard my name before it's

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,720
probably due to one of my open source

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,730
projects you can find them on github or

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,519
my website the most popular of which are

11
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:48,550
prism J s doublet prefix-free and css3

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,460
test comm you're gonna see some of them

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,809
in my talk I'm also like cami mentioned

14
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,120
I'm an invited expert in the CSS working

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,370
group I used to work for w3c in the past

16
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,739
and these days I'm writing my first book

17
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,330
for O'Reilly which is going to be called

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,550
CSS secrets and it's gonna be it's gonna

19
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,970
be released in 2014 so if you like this

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,960
talk look out for it so I'm well aware

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,119
that this is a JavaScript conference and

22
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,640
I love JavaScript don't get me wrong but

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,250
this this talk is more about how you

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,599
don't need to use JavaScript for

25
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:25,420
everything because sometimes it's it

26
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,360
results to more maintainable code and

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,819
less code to use CSS for some things one

28
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,530
of those things is transitions and

29
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,489
animations so in the olden days which is

30
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:39,390
for some people it's still the present

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,550
when when we used CSS to change

32
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,369
something the transitions were abrupt

33
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,619
for example here when I hover over this

34
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:49,569
button its background changes and also

35
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,580
something appears you can see the

36
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,610
relevant CSS code on the side and you

37
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,660
can see that there's no transition

38
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,610
everything just magically appears out of

39
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,060
nowhere this is bad user experience we

40
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,619
might not notice it because we're used

41
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:07,119
to understanding how stuff works but for

42
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,140
people that aren't as used to computers

43
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,030
as much as we are it might be very

44
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,250
confusing for example my favorite

45
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,830
example of this is the the the

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,980
minimizing effect that OSX has if you've

47
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,200
ever used Mac OS you're probably

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,790
familiar with it he'll when you minimize

49
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,550
a window it does this effect before it

50
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,700
disappears it

51
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,379
just magically disappear out of the

52
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:37,360
screen the reason this happens is that

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,890
it's not just Apple's way of showing us

54
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,360
that they're cool and they can do nice

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,879
animations it actually serves a purpose

56
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,739
for people that aren't very tech savvy

57
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,290
it shows them where the window went we

58
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,730
might not often think about that because

59
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,200
obviously we know where the window when

60
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,090
it's on the dock we can find it it's

61
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,190
pretty obvious stuff right but it's not

62
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,140
obvious for everybody so this helps

63
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,700
people that aren't as accustomed to

64
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,269
using new eyes to know where where it

65
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,819
went on how to bring it back of course

66
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,980
sometimes delays are even worse I'm not

67
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,900
saying you should after this talk you

68
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,849
should go to every CSS code you've

69
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:12,440
written not tons of transitions that's

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,170
horrible it's even worse especially for

71
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,970
advanced users if you are delaying them

72
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,349
with the transition that serves no

73
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:19,670
purpose because they know what's going

74
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,329
on it's it's much worse than everything

75
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,540
being abrupt for example when I'm the

76
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,400
text editor I like to use is called

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,410
espresso not many people use it but I

78
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,230
kind of like it so even though it has

79
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,560
lots of nice features there is something

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,239
that really bothers me when you press

81
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,250
command and L to go to a specific line

82
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,370
in your code there is this very long

83
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,370
animation for the window to appear that

84
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,019
lets you type here the line you want to

85
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,030
go to that really bugs me every time it

86
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,560
bugs me so much that I end up not even

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,630
using this feature just manually looking

88
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,519
for the line of code I want to go there

89
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,970
because usually when you want to go to a

90
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,100
specific line of code you don't want to

91
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,230
go you don't just sit around thinking oh

92
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,600
I gonna go to line 120 I think it's a

93
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,299
cool line usually it's because you're

94
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:09,560
debugging something you saw an error

95
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,069
message type error or not on line 120

96
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,049
and you're frustrated what the hell did

97
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:16,789
I screw up this time so you're gonna go

98
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,039
there and see what what what what went

99
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,789
wrong you don't want to be delayed with

100
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:23,810
animations you know where the window

101
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,789
came out from you know what's going on

102
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,960
you're a developer for fuck's sake so

103
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,530
yeah don't piss off your users you

104
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,090
should you should take it on a

105
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,250
case-by-case basis do I need to use a

106
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,020
transition here would it help it's

107
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,310
always a trade-off it's a trade-off

108
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,140
between the

109
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,630
and making your UI more understandable

110
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,810
and the more advanced your users the

111
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,340
less transitions you should probably use

112
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,260
and the or the or the quickest you

113
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,950
should make them anyway so let's assume

114
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,540
we want to animate the background color

115
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,730
of an element in the past we would

116
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,890
probably include like a huge library for

117
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,320
example jQuery and sometimes we might

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,340
even need to include an extra plugin and

119
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,620
then we would have to write JavaScript

120
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,170
to do something like this this is just

121
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,400
an example I know it could be done

122
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,550
better so in this case we've included a

123
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,230
total of 93 kilobytes minified for now

124
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,970
just to do a transition how many of you

125
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,220
have included a library any like any

126
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,530
JavaScript library in your page just to

127
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,020
be able to do transitions or animations

128
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,969
be honest

129
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:43,509
so this is pretty horrible we don't

130
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,569
really need to do this anymore because

131
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:50,500
we have CSS transitions now so I'm not

132
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,520
gonna dwell on the basics but for

133
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,960
example in this in this very simple

134
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,729
example you have a button it changes its

135
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:00,009
color when you hover over it and it

136
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:02,879
happens abruptly like CSS 2.1 used to be

137
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,210
if the the the way to use a very very

138
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,789
simple transition is to write something

139
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:13,060
like this this tells the browser any

140
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,039
property you can possibly transition

141
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,900
please transition it and make it last

142
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,930
one second so now when I hover over it

143
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,330
or out of it it happens smoothly and it

144
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,229
takes one second you can even have

145
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:31,129
different transitions on the hover State

146
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,310
for example if I specify zero seconds

147
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,930
here when I hover all the button it

148
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,539
happens immediately but when I hover out

149
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,190
of it it happens smoothly this might be

150
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,930
useful for example when you want to do

151
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,699
something and the user is in a rush and

152
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,889
you don't want to delay them with fancy

153
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,409
transitions but when on the out state

154
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,240
you have more time to do a nice

155
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,710
transition so this is like the simplest

156
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,210
possible way to do a CSS transition but

157
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,490
before I move on to other examples I

158
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,770
know what many of you are thinking yeah

159
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,289
this is cool stuff but come on I can't

160
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,419
use it yet because come on won't

161
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:12,550
somebody think of the browsers the

162
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,409
browser support for this is terrible I

163
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:17,469
can't use it in my projects today so

164
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:19,319
let's get this out of the way first

165
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,219
because I don't want you to be thinking

166
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:23,919
about this throughout my talk I want you

167
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,250
to be focusing on the code so this is

168
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,900
the browser support for transitions and

169
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,050
animations today basically they're

170
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,630
supported by almost every browser in use

171
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,219
today except I 9 and below this means

172
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:42,219
that worldwide at least I know in Asia

173
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,919
the the numbers are slightly worse but

174
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,919
worldwide this is about 80% of your

175
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,599
users

176
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,849
and I know you might be thinking what

177
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,309
about the the other 20% I don't want my

178
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,199
website to break for one out of five

179
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,990
people well the thing is these features

180
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,639
are designed in such a way that your

181
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,619
website won't break for the right foot

182
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,869
for the people who use old browsers

183
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:05,999
there just won't be an effect there just

184
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,759
won't be a transition it won't be as

185
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,580
easy to use but it will still work

186
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,830
everything will would still work if you

187
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,529
write your code properly if you if you

188
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,849
write your code with graceful

189
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:20,399
degradation in mind this shouldn't be a

190
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,249
problem and the time you save by doing

191
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:24,689
it with CSS transitions and animations

192
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:27,959
instead of JavaScript and the way your

193
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,879
code is is much more organized because

194
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,849
the style isn't in the CSS file it's not

195
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,759
scattered around your JavaScript I think

196
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,709
I think it makes it worth it so here's

197
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,169
another example there's a div when I'm

198
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,220
pressing my keyboard arrows it grows

199
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,009
because this transition is applied to it

200
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:51,449
it's a very simple transition that I

201
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,000
showed earlier so this is that the the

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
HTML CSS code looks like this obviously

203
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,130
the CSS code is a bit longer than this

204
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,389
but this is the parts you should be

205
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,189
concerned about it's just the day of a

206
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:04,170
class of light box it has a width and

207
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,750
height of 0 and when I press my keyboard

208
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,240
arrow keys I apply a class of current

209
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,720
which makes it grow so as the class

210
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,870
lightbox should probably gives away this

211
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,880
is not the kind of transition I wanted I

212
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,529
wanted the transition that looks like

213
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:22,160
these like box galleries where you have

214
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,050
when the image grows vertically and then

215
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,029
it grows horizontally and then when it

216
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:28,889
shrinks it does it the reverse wait

217
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,720
first shrinks horizontally and then

218
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,560
vertically so is this the only kind of

219
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,420
CSS transition you can you can do

220
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,829
everything happening at the same time

221
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,930
because we don't want this we want the

222
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,600
width to be first and the height to be

223
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,699
second so that we sequence those

224
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:46,170
transitions and we create this very

225
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,829
popular lightbox effect it turns out you

226
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,839
can't do this with CSS but you first I

227
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,579
first need to tell you three more things

228
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:55,740
about CSS transitions that might seem

229
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,399
useless the first you might seem useless

230
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,839
but they become really useful when I try

231
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,339
to do when I tell you the the third

232
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,740
one that binds it all together the first

233
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,749
thing is you can constrain transitions

234
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:10,259
by CSS property if I specify a CSS

235
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:12,600
property here only that property will be

236
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,420
transitioned so here when I do this when

237
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,980
I press my keyboard arrow keys again

238
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,439
it's only to hide the transition

239
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:22,439
smoothly the width judge just just jumps

240
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:26,430
to the ankle abruptly like in CSS 2.1

241
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:34,399
the second thing i wanted to show you is

242
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,809
transition delays if I specify a second

243
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,829
time value here for example one second

244
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,240
the transition will take one second to

245
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,959
start it becomes more clear if I specify

246
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,600
property as well so here as you can see

247
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,370
the width jumps immediately to the end

248
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,519
value but the height takes one second to

249
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,350
start transitioning and you might be

250
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,480
wondering why why would I need to do

251
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,319
this but both of these features become

252
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,559
much more useful if you if I if I tell

253
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,759
you that you can use multiple

254
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,649
transitions with different parameters if

255
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:14,999
you separate them by commas

256
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:19,620
so I can use I can specify a 1 second

257
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,370
width transition followed by a 1 second

258
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,139
high transition that weights 1 second

259
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,360
before it starts and if you think about

260
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,749
it what this does is that the width will

261
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:32,490
kick in immediately the width transition

262
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,499
will start immediately after I press

263
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:37,110
make here my keyboard arrow but the high

264
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,850
transition will wait one second which

265
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,649
means the width will have finished

266
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,920
transitioning before the height starts

267
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,050
which effectively makes them happen in

268
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,209
sequence as you can see now so this is

269
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,170
almost what I wanted but not quite when

270
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,059
it closes it's exactly what I wanted

271
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:00,120
width first height second when it opens

272
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,800
I wanted that the height to happen first

273
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,319
than the width second I wanted them to

274
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,230
happen in Reverse but here the width is

275
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,819
first in the height second in both cases

276
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:12,040
so what I need to do

277
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,139
is what I showed you before about

278
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,720
specifying different transitions for

279
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,329
different states so when the keyboard

280
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:23,800
when the lightbox has the class of

281
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:30,750
current I can reverse these properties

282
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,889
and I works the way I wanted both ways

283
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,380
and if I want to make the code more

284
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,690
drive because now if I want to change

285
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,699
the duration I need to change it in six

286
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:45,519
places so if I need to if I want to make

287
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,230
the code more dry I can just override

288
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,759
transition property because transition

289
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,589
is a shorthand and this should work the

290
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:59,399
same but now if I want to change the the

291
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,290
transition duration of this I only need

292
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,579
to change it in three places which is

293
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:05,410
half than before it's still not

294
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,940
perfectly dry but it's a big improvement

295
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,920
and also since this is a lightbox why

296
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,250
not add an overlay in so if you remember

297
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,380
the CSS code I showed earlier there's a

298
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:24,970
box shadow here

299
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:31,510
if I add

300
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,209
if I if I tweak the box shadow a bit by

301
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:38,540
adding another one with zero offset zero

302
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,600
blur and a very large spread and making

303
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,850
it semi trans semi-transparent black and

304
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:54,740
also adding one here with a completely

305
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,270
transparent color because I want the

306
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,770
color to transition so I need to tell

307
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,360
the browser that don't animate the

308
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,070
spread just animate the color this is

309
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,959
why I added this redundant shadow here

310
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,100
that does nothing so now which the Box

311
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,470
shadow doesn't animate we have an

312
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,100
overlay but there's no animation for it

313
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,520
and that's because we have specified

314
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,140
that we only want the width and height

315
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,279
to animate if we add a box shadow

316
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:35,660
transition here and here

317
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,360
it should also fade just like we're used

318
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,270
to in light boxes and we did that with

319
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,070
no extra elements not even pseudo

320
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,230
elements just a box shadow I've actually

321
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,710
used this effect in webplatform.org when

322
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,430
I was working at w3c the video that

323
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,320
appears here has a very very similar

324
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,660
transition effect it's all done with CSS

325
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,260
and in users using ie8 ie9

326
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,570
what happens is that they just see the

327
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,100
window immediately there's no animation

328
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,260
and there's no overlay big deal they can

329
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,680
still see the video everything works

330
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,840
nothing breaks just no effects here's

331
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,820
another common example obviously it's

332
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,440
simplified from what you would usually

333
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,230
use in a website but the idea is you

334
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,420
have some text and when you hover over

335
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,590
it some more text is revealed and that

336
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,540
happens because we are transitioning the

337
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,610
height however if I go here and add

338
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,390
another line you can see that line

339
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,240
because the height is hard-coded we

340
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,470
don't want the height the other height

341
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,150
to be hard-coded so let's specify

342
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:56,850
height:auto as you can see when I

343
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,010
specify height:auto it doesn't quite

344
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,820
work and the reason it doesn't work is

345
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,050
that

346
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,340
yeah

347
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,450
what's going on here the reason it

348
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,430
doesn't work is that for value to be

349
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,090
animatable

350
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,620
you should be possible - it should be

351
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,120
possible to represent all intermediate

352
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,020
states in CSS CSS transitions and

353
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,880
animations work the same way basically

354
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,029
as what jQuery does they take the two

355
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,589
states and they generate all the

356
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:32,700
intermediate frames

357
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,560
it just happens behind the scenes in the

358
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,360
browser but you should still be able to

359
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,310
represent them in CSS because otherwise

360
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,710
what if you do a get computed style

361
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,900
while an animation is running what do

362
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,089
you get back you need to be able to get

363
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:48,660
a proper CSS value back which means when

364
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,040
you want you animate something like a

365
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,890
height from 0 to 100 or whatever value

366
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,890
you can figure out what the intermediate

367
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,200
states would be same when you're doing a

368
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,000
transition between colors because colors

369
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,880
are basically still numbers they're

370
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,800
converted to RGB a and it's just the

371
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,319
numbers that are interpolated same with

372
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,980
transforms it's all numbers even things

373
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,050
like weird things like gel index can

374
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,030
still be animated it's just that the

375
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,380
intermediate states are all integers

376
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,870
because they only accept integers but

377
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,480
you can still animate them but what

378
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,640
happens when you have height:auto to 100

379
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,130
pixels

380
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,179
what's the intermediate stage how can

381
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,550
you say something that's 25% auto and

382
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,690
75% a hundred pixels there's no such

383
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,810
value or when you want to show something

384
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,380
by setting display from none to block

385
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,690
what are the intermediate states same

386
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,580
with an image how can you say something

387
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,740
that's 30% foo JPEG and 70% bar JPEG

388
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,900
there is a caveat here gradients

389
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,760
gradients are all numbers because

390
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,320
they're just functions with colors and

391
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,690
colors top positions so you would expect

392
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,220
that the intermediate values would be

393
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,290
something like this so you would expect

394
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,770
you'd be able to animate them however

395
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,310
browsers are being dicks here because

396
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,230
you can't really uneme gradients today

397
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,030
in Britain in today's browser you should

398
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,700
be able to eventually it wasn't the spec

399
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,760
and it wasn't CSS values CSS image

400
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,820
values 3 but it got removed because no

401
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,419
browser implemented it

402
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:25,919
however don't be sad because there are

403
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,690
lots and lots of things you can animate

404
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,019
in CSS I've created a gallery here you

405
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,649
can find it on my github with animations

406
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:36,720
with just a single property and it's

407
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,279
kind of impressive what you can do by

408
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,279
animating just one property so imagine

409
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,230
what you can do if you only made lots of

410
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:49,919
properties together this is my favorite

411
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,769
kind of makes you wonder if you're drunk

412
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:58,259
and especially if you animate transforms

413
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:01,429
you can create really interesting stuff

414
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:04,470
especially CSS transforms CSS 3d

415
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:13,930
transforms as you can see here

416
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,010
and even when you want to make stuff

417
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,320
appear even though you can't animate you

418
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,060
can't make it animate when you're just

419
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,560
doing when you're just hiding and

420
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,970
showing it with display:none in

421
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,040
display:block you can still use other

422
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,150
ways to hide and show things for example

423
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:37,610
if you use a transform instead actually

424
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,680
let me show you first that it doesn't

425
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,900
work just in case you don't believe me

426
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,940
if I do a transition of one second

427
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,290
still nothing but if I hide it with a

428
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,680
transform instead of a transition and

429
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,250
show it with the transform now it

430
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,440
animates and obviously this is not very

431
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,060
useful but if I set the transform origin

432
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,590
to be somewhere horizontally in the

433
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:18,410
center vertically at the top well I

434
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,820
still need to fiddle with it a little

435
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:25,070
bit maybe minus 10 pixels it's telling

436
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,840
you it's starting to become something

437
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,030
that would be more desirable obviously

438
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,290
you need to fiddle with it a little bit

439
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,140
to do exactly what you want and yes in

440
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,250
this case this doesn't degrade

441
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,030
gracefully

442
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,980
because if not if transitions and

443
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,220
animations are not supported you just

444
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,290
have it there at all times it doesn't

445
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,760
hide in it that doesn't appear so you

446
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,800
should use something like moderniser to

447
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,240
detect whether transitions and

448
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,990
transforms are supported and make your

449
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,240
and apply different CSS code in those

450
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,910
cases but it's still doable and the

451
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,530
JavaScript code you need to you need to

452
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,600
write in those cases is still much much

453
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,260
less than whether you done in cases then

454
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,150
if you were writing the transfer the

455
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,670
transitions and animations in JavaScript

456
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,580
as well also I told you before that you

457
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,360
can't do animations between images but I

458
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,460
kind of lied you can't do transitions

459
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,200
between images in CSS image values 3 it

460
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,180
was there but it got removed for the

461
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,160
same reason gradient transitions were

462
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,570
removed because browsers didn't

463
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,010
implement

464
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:30,130
but there is a new crossfade function

465
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,470
that does exactly what I said you can't

466
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,270
do before that allows you to specify

467
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,610
that you want an image that's 10% foo

468
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,500
jpg and 90% bar jpg by changing by

469
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,690
overlaying one image on all on another

470
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,780
and changing the dimensions and you

471
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,390
might be thinking that CSS image values

472
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,030
level 4 is very far from now but we've

473
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,780
already started getting implementations

474
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,520
chrome already supports this and has

475
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,140
been supporting this for a while and

476
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,270
chrome has a very huge market share work

477
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,150
worldwide these days and it's been

478
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,410
supporting this since April 2012 this is

479
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,810
just me animating a CSS logo you don't

480
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,570
even there's no crossfade function in

481
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,790
the code here it's just used behind the

482
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,100
scenes by the browser to make the

483
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,930
transition of course you can use it in

484
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,370
your CSS as well if you want here's

485
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,140
another cool thing you can do with

486
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,450
transitions so here I have a div when I

487
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,230
keep my mouse button pressed on it and

488
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,840
it gets the pseudo class of active the

489
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,460
background changes and the text color

490
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,350
changes as well just in case somebody is

491
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,060
colorblind and can't be can't see the

492
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,500
background change so if we add a simple

493
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,440
transition here you can imagine how that

494
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,420
would work

495
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,460
it would smoothly transition to these

496
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,030
colors and then smoothly back however if

497
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,360
you recall we can specify different

498
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,030
transitions so here we can specify a

499
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:09,790
transition with that lasts one second in

500
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,650
here a transition that lasts zero

501
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,140
seconds so effectively no transition but

502
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,780
is delayed one second what this does is

503
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,330
when I click on it there is a transition

504
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,330
it happens smoothly but when I release

505
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,480
my mouse button it takes a second to go

506
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,620
back so if I if I use like a very large

507
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,160
value here and you imagine what would

508
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,280
work what would happen there is a nice

509
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,380
transition when I click on it

510
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,260
and then it just stays there it doesn't

511
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,080
go back so this is effectively a way to

512
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,500
maintain state with CSS and in this

513
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,750
example it's not very useful although I

514
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,090
can still think of some use cases but

515
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,400
somebody used this to make this demo

516
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,380
which is a character controlled by CSS

517
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,780
but buttons so this is all CSS there's

518
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:10,840
no JavaScript here also you might if any

519
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,730
of you used flash before you might be

520
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,070
wondering yeah okay this is cool but

521
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,140
what if I want more fine-grained control

522
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,880
in my animation what if I want to

523
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,640
control how the animation progresses

524
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,770
from the start value to the end value so

525
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,150
here you can see two different ways for

526
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,070
that to happen the first one is the

527
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,429
default and the second one in the second

528
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,220
one it progresses linearly which means

529
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,059
at 30% time it will be 30% through the

530
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,400
transition there's no acceleration no

531
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,080
deceleration it just happens linearly

532
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,679
but you don't have to even be you don't

533
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,000
have to even be constrained between

534
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
those two you can get the second

535
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,679
behavior by specifying the keyword

536
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,440
linear and there are a few other

537
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:03,600
keywords like ease in which this which

538
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,570
speeds up towards the end there's also

539
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,299
ease out but these are just shorthand

540
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,570
for a function called cubic Bezier cubic

541
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:20,789
Bezier looks like this and it accepts

542
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:25,240
four values from zero to one usually but

543
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,750
not necessarily and it's almost

544
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,270
impossible to describe this just by

545
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,549
showing you the function it's much

546
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:35,380
easier to describe this graphically

547
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,480
because cubic Bezier corresponds to a

548
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,039
Bezier curve from one point to another

549
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,700
and the two values are the coordinates

550
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,620
over the first of this pole of the first

551
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,409
handle and the last two are the

552
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,030
coordinates of the second handle so this

553
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,830
is basically a graph of

554
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,539
how the transition progresses over time

555
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:55,690
the horizontal axis is time the vertical

556
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,779
axis is progression so if you if you do

557
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:01,360
something like this for example it means

558
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,539
that as time goes by it will start

559
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:06,250
moving towards the end value then it

560
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,429
will slowly go back and then it will

561
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:11,049
keep going towards the end value which

562
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:13,120
looks like this did you see how it

563
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,820
stopped in the middle went back and then

564
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,769
forwards and it's really useful if you

565
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:20,380
want to do bounce effects look at this

566
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,299
this means it goes towards the end value

567
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:24,669
really quickly then it jumps further

568
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:28,179
than the end value and then it goes back

569
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:29,950
to the end value which creates a bounce

570
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:40,970
and you can even do bounces like this

571
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,409
something that bounces before it starts

572
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:46,500
not at the end and this up is online at

573
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,389
cubic Bezier calm or you can find it at

574
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:54,000
my github but even though transitions

575
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,740
are pretty cool and they're a huge step

576
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,100
forward from what we had in CSS 2.1

577
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,570
they're still quite limited they can't

578
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,250
be fired on page load for example if you

579
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,010
want to have like an element fall from

580
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,299
the sky when the page when the user

581
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,889
loads the page you can't do it you can't

582
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:10,350
repeat them like three times for example

583
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,990
there's just a start at state and an end

584
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,049
state and it's just that and they can't

585
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:17,850
be about different properties for

586
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,169
example you can't you can't animate if

587
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:24,389
the start value and the end value is

588
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:26,039
about background you can't be animating

589
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,419
the color the text color as well and

590
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:32,880
this is why the gods of CSS gave us CSS

591
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,250
animations CSS animations are more

592
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,049
powerful but also more verbose more

593
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:39,149
complicated so if you can do something

594
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:40,860
with CSS transitions you should do it

595
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,529
with CSS transitions but if you can't it

596
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,610
doesn't mean you have to result to

597
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,380
JavaScript you can still do it sometimes

598
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,990
you can still do it in CSS with CSS

599
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,809
animations although basically everything

600
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:53,490
you can do with CSS animations you can

601
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,840
also do it with a combination of

602
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,389
JavaScript and CSS transitions so a

603
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:03,840
basic animation this is a basic

604
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,769
animation it has two components it

605
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,779
starts from this from this dark red

606
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:11,669
background then it goes to orange

607
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:13,620
halfway and then it goes to yellow green

608
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,669
and animations have two components one

609
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:19,529
of them is the keyframes rule that that

610
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:22,380
defines the basic state the basic States

611
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,510
and obviously the browser interpolates

612
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,399
between them as well and then you need

613
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,559
to use the animation function to bind

614
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,200
these to specify where you want to use

615
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,679
this transition and the animation

616
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,750
property did I say function I meant

617
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,909
property the animation property is very

618
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:40,740
similar to the transition property it

619
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,440
takes a time value as well here's one

620
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,649
second and instead of oops or instead of

621
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:49,200
a CSS property it takes the name of an

622
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,190
animation you've defined in this case

623
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,970
rainbow so you can see how our animation

624
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,060
happened and then it it went away and we

625
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,440
can see the background that we had

626
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,660
before so we can make it repeat by

627
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,230
specifying a number here let me remove

628
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,480
it and reapply it so now it will happen

629
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,220
three times and then it will stop again

630
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,270
and if we don't want it to ever stop we

631
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,220
can specify infinite and now it will

632
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,180
just keep on animating but I'm gonna

633
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,830
stop it because otherwise some people

634
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:34,550
here will get Caesar's also a 0% can be

635
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,590
written as from and 100% can be written

636
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,130
as two and you don't even use the you

637
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,950
don't even need to use both of them if

638
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,540
one of them is missing the browser will

639
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,760
just generate it from the normal state

640
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,630
so if I remove this instead of animating

641
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,970
from dark red the browser will animate

642
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,620
from the slate but gray background I

643
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,270
have now so let me remove the animation

644
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,970
and reapply it so as you can see

645
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,980
although I should probably make it a bit

646
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:06,200
longer it animates from the state from

647
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,120
its normal state towards orange and

648
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,110
yellow green and then it jumps back this

649
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,170
is another example I'm animating this

650
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,930
heart from a transform of none to a

651
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:23,930
scale of 120% which which makes it look

652
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,020
like it's pounding but it doesn't look

653
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,740
very smooth so one way to make it smooth

654
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:39,590
is to change this to 50% and change this

655
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:45,080
four to Frohman two and this should be

656
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,860
double wears cruel not applying my CSS

657
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,500
let me remove it and reapply it yep that

658
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,190
works so now it seems more smooth but

659
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,350
it's still unnatural and the reason it's

660
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,190
unnatural is because when it grows the

661
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,070
the timing function remember those cubic

662
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,490
Bezier values I showed you earlier so

663
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,470
when it grows it houses a certain timing

664
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,000
function of ease which is the default in

665
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,549
this case but when it shrinks the timing

666
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:15,970
function doesn't reverse it just keeps

667
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,409
being the same which makes it look

668
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:23,299
unnatural however there's a better way

669
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,960
to do this this is a simple animation

670
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,000
from a background of yellow to a

671
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,309
background of blue I can bind it by

672
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:38,809
doing something like this and specify

673
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:41,090
three iterations and because Chrome is

674
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,840
an idiot remove it and reapply it so as

675
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,789
you can see this case it goes smoothly

676
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:48,320
from yellow to blue and then it just

677
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,639
jumps back to yellow so that it so that

678
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:55,010
it repeats this is its progress over

679
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,919
time we can change this behavior by

680
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,009
using the property animation Direction

681
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:04,490
if we specify that an animation

682
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,070
direction of alternate instead of

683
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,409
looking like this it looks like this

684
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:12,169
which means every second iteration is

685
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:15,080
flipped it's reversed so it goes

686
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,789
smoothly to from yellow to blue and then

687
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:19,039
smoothly from blue to yellow so the

688
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,179
whole animation is smoother and if I

689
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:27,260
remove this and reapply it you can see

690
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,169
how it smoothly goes from blue to yellow

691
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:32,809
in every in the second animation which

692
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:34,190
makes the whole thing smoother and

693
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,620
there's also reverse which reverses

694
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,990
every single iteration and alternate

695
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,279
reverse which is a combination of

696
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,779
alternate and reverse it reverses

697
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:44,000
everything the first iteration the third

698
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,700
iteration so on every row decoration so

699
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,470
how can we take advantage of this year

700
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,870
if we specify the keyword alternate we

701
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,570
instantly made it smoother and it looks

702
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,950
even more natural

703
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:05,590
well I first need to make this the way

704
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:14,440
it was from and to and copy cut and

705
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,100
paste it

706
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,509
okay this was how it was in the

707
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:18,639
beginning if I specify the keyword

708
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:24,730
alternate it suddenly becomes much

709
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,559
smoother and I can now reduce the

710
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,129
duration Chrome is so annoying there

711
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:39,419
there you go just by using it keyword

712
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:42,700
this is a bit of a different example

713
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,509
it's a very common caveat here I have a

714
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:51,429
border animating from zero solid to 100%

715
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,860
solid so it's basically just the border

716
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,100
width animating and I've applied the

717
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,909
animation here but there's no border I

718
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:02,049
can't see any border I can't see any

719
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:04,389
animation and it's not because the color

720
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:06,279
is missing because the if when the color

721
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,840
is missing it just gets the text color

722
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,060
which is black I can even include the

723
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,569
color if you don't believe me it still

724
00:34:13,569 --> 00:34:15,119
won't work

725
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,700
can anybody imagine why it doesn't work

726
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,000
it doesn't work is that border is just

727
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,790
the shorthand of border width border

728
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,429
style and border color in this case

729
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,349
border width and border color are

730
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:35,710
animatable so it's fine but border style

731
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,929
is not animatable you can't go from none

732
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:40,629
which is the default value to solid with

733
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:42,940
an animation it's just either none or

734
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,280
solid there's no such thing as 50% none

735
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,659
and 50% solid

736
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:49,060
so since border style is not animatable

737
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,089
its dropped from the animation it's like

738
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:53,800
it doesn't exist and since it doesn't

739
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,560
exist you get the default border style

740
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,950
which is none so if you specify a border

741
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,990
style here and reapply the animation so

742
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,110
I specified non solid

743
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,000
if you specify a border style of solid

744
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,870
here you can start seeing the animation

745
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,280
because the border style is not defined

746
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,830
in the keyframes now this behavior will

747
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,870
actually be changed that was a

748
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,640
resolution we made in the CSS working

749
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,860
group last year browsers haven't caught

750
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,050
up with it yet and actually it was this

751
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,020
example this example in a doublet that I

752
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,300
presented and made the CSS working group

753
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:40,540
changed its mind and this is a PNG file

754
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,410
with ten frames of an animation this is

755
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,980
some CSS code that applies to this div

756
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:58,510
whoops and let me show you where what

757
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,580
the boundaries of the d'Ivoire this is

758
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,040
our div it has a width of 50 pixels and

759
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,980
a height of 72 pixels and we want to

760
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,600
have a frame-by-frame animation I mean

761
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,640
we already have our frames here and this

762
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,500
div is basically functioning as a stripe

763
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,930
as a sprite so if we manually change

764
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,820
this to 50 pixels we can see a different

765
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,400
frame with a hundred pixels we can see

766
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,640
another frame - 150 pixels another frame

767
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,490
so if we manually change this we can see

768
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,200
all the different frames so we want to

769
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,920
do this with a CSS animation so our

770
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,550
naive first approach would be to write

771
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,829
the keyframes rule

772
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:50,359
from no to background position - 500

773
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:53,719
pixels and zero we don't need to write

774
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,489
the Frome rule because like I said

775
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,140
before it will be generated from this

776
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,529
value which also made makes it the great

777
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:02,630
gracefully very easily because in

778
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,799
browsers that don't support CSS

779
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:05,630
animations you just don't get an

780
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,499
animation you get the first frame and

781
00:37:08,499 --> 00:37:12,019
let's tie the animation oh I didn't

782
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:15,769
specify a name wave let's tie the

783
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:21,529
animation here with our element so you

784
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:23,960
can see how this didn't go down very

785
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,549
well this is not a frame-by-frame

786
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:29,239
animation it's just awful and even if we

787
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:32,150
specify a linear keyword so that it

788
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,589
doesn't accelerate and decelerate like

789
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:35,749
this it's still weird it this is not a

790
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:44,599
key frame by frame animation so should

791
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:47,059
we give up is it impossible to do a

792
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:49,549
sprite animation in CSS should we use

793
00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:53,630
JavaScript actually no because we don't

794
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,940
just have cubic Bezier easing functions

795
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,680
we also have another type of easing

796
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,779
functions which is steps and steps just

797
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:05,239
makes abrupt changes but lots of them

798
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:08,150
how many as many as the parameter you

799
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,579
specify which is very useful for frame

800
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,799
by frame animations and you might be

801
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:14,390
wondering why do I need another way to

802
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,200
create animated gifs why why is this

803
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,920
useful the reason this is useful is that

804
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,219
this way you can animate images that

805
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,920
have alpha transparency gifs don't have

806
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,469
alpha transparency so for example if you

807
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:33,049
want to have like a spinner on top of

808
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:35,269
your whatever and you don't know what

809
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,039
background it will be on it will be much

810
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:39,079
better to do it this way then here's an

811
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,999
animated gif which needs to have a

812
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:44,420
specific background color and yes there

813
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,299
was an image type that was supposed to

814
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:49,789
do this it was called a P&G and some

815
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:51,710
browsers do support it but you might be

816
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,200
surprised to hear that ap

817
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,150
she has worse browser support than

818
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:01,960
animations this is the program the

819
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,280
spinner here by the way was done this

820
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,390
way and this is another nice function of

821
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,960
steps this is a typing animation there

822
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,329
are two animations in play here one of

823
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:15,609
them is the typing animation which

824
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:19,300
animates the width from 0 to your final

825
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,550
width and this one animates the caret

826
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,240
here with and it makes it blink also

827
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,480
with with steps this is all the code

828
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,329
this needs and since the steps are not

829
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:36,280
hard-coded in the keyframes rule but

830
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,440
here you can also set them with

831
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,760
JavaScript and it's also using the CH

832
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,410
unit which many of you might not have

833
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,710
seen the CH unit is corresponds to the

834
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,510
width of the 0 character which is useful

835
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,490
when you have monospaced fonts like this

836
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,200
because the width of a 0 character is

837
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,700
the same as the width of every character

838
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:01,020
and in case animations are not supported

839
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,480
this is what people will see which still

840
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,619
communicates the same effect there's no

841
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:10,240
animation but the text is still legible

842
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,800
and it kind of looks like a console type

843
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,560
thing so it's not horrible

844
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,599
when animations are not supported it's

845
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,050
just better when they are and this is a

846
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,310
whole point about graceful degradation

847
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,619
this is another case and I'm running out

848
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:34,540
of time so a while back a friend of mine

849
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,740
Chris coiour

850
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,690
if you've heard him from CSS tricks came

851
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,079
to me and he was like how can I make an

852
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,839
element rotate in a circular path

853
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,849
without the actual air element rotating

854
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:47,109
because here it is rotating in a

855
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:49,150
circular path but the element is also

856
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,700
rotating as well we don't we don't want

857
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,140
that we just wanted to move in a

858
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,400
circular path so at first I thought it

859
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,750
couldn't be done but after a while I

860
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,300
came up with a solution of using two

861
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,900
transforms on two different elements and

862
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,870
having one of them cancelled

863
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:09,590
the other which would look like this I

864
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:13,400
have to reverse rotations at every at

865
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,710
any point the each rotation cancels the

866
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:19,160
other I have two elements a different

867
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,390
transform origin and a different

868
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,270
animation applies to each of them so one

869
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,740
of them cancels the other so you see no

870
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,240
rotation but you just see the movement

871
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,740
and you can make it even shorter if you

872
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,670
use animation direction so you can

873
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,300
eliminate this and instead of overriding

874
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,400
animation name override animation

875
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,050
direction which just generates this

876
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:47,390
counterclockwise animation on the fly by

877
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,580
using animation direction reverse and if

878
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,310
I remove this and reapply it you can see

879
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,470
that it still works with less code but

880
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,920
you need you still need to HTML elements

881
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,510
however when I when I wrote to the CSS

882
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,610
working group and asked them to allow

883
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,580
people to specify different transform

884
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,230
origins on the same element so you don't

885
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,910
need two elements to do this sort of

886
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,060
thing a guy called Aria Gregor wrote

887
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,770
back to me and she was like you couldn't

888
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:15,050
do this today it's just that the syntax

889
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,450
is not very intuitive and you can do it

890
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,600
this way by using a transform that

891
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,090
rotates an element then translates it by

892
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,800
a fixed amount and then rotates it back

893
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,630
by the same amount of degrees it was

894
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,150
rotated earlier which means the two

895
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,770
rotations cancel each other but you

896
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,100
still see the translation because the

897
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,810
thing with transforms is every transform

898
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,480
operates on the on the coordinate system

899
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,280
that the previous transform set they're

900
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,310
not independent their order matters so

901
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,230
the element rotates then it moves and

902
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,940
then it rotates back so you see the

903
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,670
movement but you don't see the rotation

904
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,070
it did take me like a few months to

905
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,530
understand how that worked

906
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:01,310
so as this talk is close to its end this

907
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,930
is pretty much what I covered so there

908
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,640
are still things that you you can read

909
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,960
about if you're interested in

910
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,780
transitions and animations one of them

911
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,060
is the animation film mode and that

912
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,010
specifies how your animation behaves

913
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,260
when it's not playing and also the

914
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,700
events there there are lots of events

915
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,970
fires like transition

916
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,430
and animation start things like that

917
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,780
that you can use in JavaScript to do

918
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:29,339
cool stuff and before I finish a short

919
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,050
reality check the code I showed you

920
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,690
looks like this but um prefix

921
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,339
transitions have much worse browser

922
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,670
support only 60% of browsers and

923
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,200
prefixed animations are even worse only

924
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,160
one out of four users will be able to

925
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,740
see any of unprefixed animations so even

926
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,880
though the code I showed you looks like

927
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,300
this

928
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,960
the actual code looks like this and yes

929
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,300
I know this is horrible but there are

930
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,170
ways to make your code more Drive one of

931
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,140
them is my library prefix treats pretty

932
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,190
short you just drop it in your page

933
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,290
right unprefixed CSS and it just makes

934
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:06,930
stuff work there are some alternatives

935
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:09,119
some websites you can go and put in your

936
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,530
code and gets prefixed there are also

937
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,420
pre processors where you can write make

938
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,250
sense but you have to write the mixin to

939
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,000
yourself and yes I know this is a bit

940
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,710
depressing so here's a picture of a

941
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,210
donkey laughing to cheer you up before I

942
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:26,010
leave you here are some resources you

943
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,780
can you don't need to write them down my

944
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,170
slides are in line and if you have any

945
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,280
questions you should find me at the

946
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,569
breaks because we don't have time right

947
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:35,520
now for questions Thomas is already kind

948
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,380
of pissed off I think so that was it I

949
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,180
hope you learned something thank you

950
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,170
very much
