00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,669

thank you so let's get started

2
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:20,130
this talk has an alternate title instead

3
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,599
of on left patent empty it's on on

4
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:23,730
writing and consuming api's with empathy

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,759
because human is hard we'll get a little

6
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,710
bit more into that afterwards but you'll

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,660
see that this talk we'll talk about left

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,260
pad but it's not the most important part

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,540
hello I put this slide at the beginning

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,820
of every one of my presentations it's a

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,110
bit of kind of a mantra and I'll just

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,049
stare at it and that calms me and now I

13
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,320
feel ready to prepare and talk my name

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,470
is miles I work for a small disruptive

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,920
start-up called IBM I full-time

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,170
contribute to the node.js project but I

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,820
just want to mention you know everything

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,080
I'm saying in this talk is my own

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,629
opinion it's not that of my employer so

20
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,390
now that the fun stuff is done and maybe

21
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,979
we should talk about what qualifies me

22
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,490
in particular to talk about empathy so I

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,620
have an undergraduate degree in fine art

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,920
but you know that doesn't do it I have a

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,690
master's degree in music and you know

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,280
that doesn't really matter to talk about

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,560
empathy either it turns out I can talk

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,480
about it because I'm a human being and

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,710
we're all humans here and it's an

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,620
important thing for all of us so then

31
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,090
that goes on to like what qualifies me

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,540
to talk about left pad so I work full

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,190
time on node but you know that doesn't

34
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,590
really matter I noticed that you co

35
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,360
system breakage in about ten minutes but

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,550
that doesn't really matter I have an

37
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,950
opinion a lot of people have those but

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,229
in your opinions don't matter nothing in

39
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,150
particular actually qualifies me to talk

40
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,590
about it so I'll probably talk about it

41
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,010
very little but so what will we talk

42
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,979
about today a brief overview of left pad

43
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,810
a definition of the word empathy empathy

44
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,979
versus sympathy this is an interesting

45
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,310
one the neuroscience of empathy how are

46
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,940
hard-wired to actually experience it

47
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,500
learning empathy because it turns out

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,760
just because we're hardwired for

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,080
something doesn't mean we're really good

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,549
at it or heard of heard for a lot of

51
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:17,370
things and then we'll talk about empathy

52
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,769
is an API developer and kind of tie this

53
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:22,350
all back together

54
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,630
it's a brief overview of left pad you

55
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,980
all probably know about what happened

56
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,690
there was a disagreement between

57
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,570
multiple parties a namespace was handed

58
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,540
over to a copyright holder a model and a

59
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,460
module publisher unpublished all other

60
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,850
modules chaos the result the community

61
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,400
grabbed all the open namespaces modules

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,860
to avoid bad actors from doing bad

63
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,200
things the version of left pad that

64
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,900
broke everything was republished NPM

65
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,550
changed their unpublished policy to

66
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,610
avoid this happening again the world

67
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,140
kept spinning and hackers kept on

68
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,300
hacking and we move forward this kind of

69
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,980
showed how resilient our community is

70
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,310
and how quickly things can move on so it

71
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,320
kind of asks you know like why are we

72
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,850
still talking about it and so we're not

73
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,080
let's talk about a definition of empathy

74
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,030
so here's a spoiler the term empathy is

75
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,190
actually just over a hundred years old

76
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,070
it's that English word empathy is a

77
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,209
hundred and eight years old that's

78
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,910
pretty amazing you know this thing that

79
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,519
if you went and looked online the

80
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,230
Supreme Court in the United States is

81
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,580
having all these discussions about

82
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,200
empathy Obama's campaign was built on

83
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,550
the idea that we need to be more

84
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,709
empathetic it seems to be in our entire

85
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,280
zeitgeist empathy you know a hundred

86
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,860
years that's not a lot of time the

87
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,290
etymology of the word though comes from

88
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,780
the German word I'm feeling and I think

89
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,660
I said that right or right ish and the

90
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,870
Greek word empathy ax I'm feeling is a

91
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,730
little bit older but still only a couple

92
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,680
hundred years old or like maybe a

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,390
hundred and fifty I have to double-check

94
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,320
that but but this is this is a new word

95
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,239
it's a new concept but it's also

96
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,739
something that we've been trying to

97
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:13,510
understand for hundreds of years and the

98
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,820
Icelandic word for empathy is Sam Kent

99
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,190
that's at least the translation that I

100
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,040
found and it roughly translates to

101
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,410
togetherness and solidarity and I really

102
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,110
like that definition but rather than

103
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,330
trying to define the word by just what

104
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,090
the word means let's talk about what it

105
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,430
means in a deeper way and there's this

106
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,520
fantastic nurse Theresa Wiseman

107
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,259
who wrote a paper about empathy with

108
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:40,660
patients and she defined the attributes

109
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,280
of empathy as understanding perspective

110
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,759
staying out of judgment recognizing what

111
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,280
the other is feeling can you in

112
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,830
communicating it back it's important to

113
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,810
be able to recognize what's happening to

114
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,449
internalize it and to then you know

115
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,250
bring that back to the individual that

116
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,210
you're talking to empathy is feeling

117
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,580
with people not for people

118
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,319
Theresa then claimed that it's the

119
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,389
ability to empathize which distinguishes

120
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,120
an average nurse from an excellent nurse

121
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,310
in the eyes of a patient so perhaps it's

122
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,229
the ability to empathize which

123
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:26,020
distinguishes the average developer from

124
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,759
an excellent developer in the eyes of

125
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,150
others and just maybe it's the ability

126
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,889
to empathize that distinguishes an

127
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,500
average human being from an excellent

128
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,219
human being in the eyes of the world

129
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:40,810
you'll see a few of these there's a this

130
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,190
is a lot of concepts so we'll take a

131
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,710
little break and just let that sink in

132
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,960
think about what it meant and stare at

133
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,310
the cat so brenÃ© Brown did this amazing

134
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,990
talk on the difference between empathy

135
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,909
and sympathy and I could not personally

136
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,889
if I wanted to do a better job so we're

137
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:03,159
gonna watch a video really quickly about

138
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,719
the difference between empathy and

139
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:16,990
sympathy so what is empathy and why is

140
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,610
it very different than sympathy empathy

141
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,800
fuels connection sympathy drives

142
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,979
disconnection empathy it's a very

143
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,930
interesting Teresa Wiseman is a nursing

144
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,009
scholar who studied professions very

145
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,330
diverse professions where empathy is

146
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,099
relevant and came up with four qualities

147
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:39,219
of empathy perspective-taking the

148
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:40,419
ability to take the perspective of

149
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:42,340
another person or recognize their

150
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,289
perspective as their truth staying out

151
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,509
of judgment not easy when you enjoy it

152
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:49,350
as much as most of us do

153
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,490
recognizing emotion and other people and

154
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,070
then communicating that empathy is

155
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,940
feeling with people and to me I always

156
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,370
think of empathy is this kind of sacred

157
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,250
space when someone's kind of in a deep

158
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,350
hole and they shout out from the bottom

159
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,200
and they say I'm stuck it's dark I'm

160
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,290
overwhelmed and then we look and we say

161
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,860
hey calm down I know what it's like down

162
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,370
here and you're not alone sympathy is

163
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:24,320
ooh it's bad uh-huh

164
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:30,370
no you want a sandwich if it he is a

165
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,290
choice and it's a vulnerable choice

166
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,330
because in order to connect with you I

167
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,550
have to connect with something in myself

168
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,690
that knows that feeling rarely if ever

169
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,660
it does an empathic response begin with

170
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,030
at least I had it yeah and we do it all

171
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,100
the time because you know what someone

172
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,690
just shared something with us that's

173
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,300
incredibly painful and we're trying to

174
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,040
silver lining it I don't think that's a

175
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,160
verb but I'm using it as one we're

176
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,270
trying to put this a little running

177
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,900
around it so I had a miscarriage at

178
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,370
least you know you can get pregnant I

179
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,380
think my marriage is falling apart at

180
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,870
least you'd have a marriage

181
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,620
John's getting kicked out of school at

182
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,229
least Sarah is an A student but one of

183
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:21,360
the things we do sometimes in the face

184
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,949
of very difficult conversations is we

185
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,440
try to make things better if I share

186
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,639
something with you that's very difficult

187
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,150
I'd rather you say I don't even know

188
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,380
what to say right now I'm just so glad

189
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,310
you told me because the truth is rarely

190
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,860
can a response make something better

191
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,839
what makes something better is

192
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:49,050
connection so you're going to notice a

193
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,700
lot of this stuff repeated through the

194
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,200
talk because I think this is really

195
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,089
important and the way to learn anything

196
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,120
is through repetition in artistic

197
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,770
practice they call it a practice because

198
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,600
you have to practice over and over to do

199
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,550
something so we're gonna have an

200
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,650
empathic practice today so I hope you

201
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,080
don't mind the repetition but empathy is

202
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,930
feeling with you and sympathy is feeling

203
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,470
for you empathy is about being present

204
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,270
with someone empathy is a choice rarely

205
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,459
can a response make something better

206
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,660
well make something better as connection

207
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,560
another tripping Kati break will let

208
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,510
that sit in

209
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,500
so let's talk a little bit about the

210
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,120
neuroscience of empathy this parts

211
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,300
really cool a lot of these ideas come

212
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,910
from a fantastic talk by Jeremy Rifkin

213
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,130
I've embedded the youtube link inside of

214
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,570
the slide so if you go and find my

215
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,360
slides online you can watch it we're not

216
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,529
going to watch this video because it's

217
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,029
over ten minutes long it was kind of

218
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,230
cheating to watch a three-minute video

219
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,970
it's definitely cheating to watch a ten

220
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,029
minute video but healthy brains are

221
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:01,130
wired for empathy one such phenomenon is

222
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,020
known as mirror neurons so there was a

223
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,890
scientist who was watching monkeys and

224
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,260
watching monkeys eat peanuts and the

225
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,450
monkeys were all wired up and they were

226
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,830
watching which neurons in the brain

227
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,200
would fire off from the monkey would eat

228
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,380
a peanut and through trouble total

229
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,120
happenstance is most amazing things

230
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,520
happen they forgot to unwire the monkey

231
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,200
one day and on the day that they didn't

232
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,820
unwire the monkey a lab assistant

233
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,589
decided to eat a peanut in front of the

234
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,870
monkey and what they discovered was that

235
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,880
the exact same neurons in the monkeys

236
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,860
brain that fired off when the monkey ate

237
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,020
the peanut fired off when it watched the

238
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,480
scientist eat the peanut that's really

239
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,850
interesting the same part of our brains

240
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,579
are active when we watch people doing

241
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,040
things our brains don't necessarily know

242
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,390
the difference between the experience of

243
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,250
ourselves and the experience of another

244
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,430
person

245
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,540
the Italian scientists that I was

246
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,200
talking about was giacomo rizzolatti and

247
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,970
he was a scientist at the University of

248
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,279
Parma Marco iacoboni professor of

249
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,260
psychiatry and bio and bio behavioral

250
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,200
sciences argued that mirror neurons are

251
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,300
the neural basis of the human capacity

252
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,790
for the emotions such as empathy so even

253
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,230
though we have this word that's only

254
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,240
about a hundred and eight years old the

255
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,029
human race has this isn't something that

256
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:28,100
our brain just developed well it

257
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,110
probably developed up from time but but

258
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,000
we've been wired for this a lot longer

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,779
than we've had a word to describe it

260
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,670
when a baby cries in a nursery and all

261
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,130
the other babies join in this is called

262
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,670
empathic distress the babies don't know

263
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,379
any language to just

264
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,689
a bit but just hearing something else

265
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:50,720
cry folks that emotion to make everyone

266
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,809
else cry around the age of two and a

267
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:56,269
half a child can actually begin to

268
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:58,369
recognize themselves in the mirror and

269
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,429
this starts with the idea of selfhood

270
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,429
and it increases this empathic

271
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:07,009
development at around eight years of age

272
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,289
a child learns about life and death and

273
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:11,720
they learn about vulnerability learning

274
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,549
about this vulnerability gives people

275
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,289
the ability to understand hey

276
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:17,539
not only is there me and is my life

277
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:19,729
sacred there's other people their lives

278
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:22,279
are sacred to all these things that I'm

279
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,199
experiencing other people are

280
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,329
experiencing and this helps us develop

281
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,229
the ability of of empathy once you

282
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:33,019
realize you only have one life you can

283
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,479
now feel others struggle you know that

284
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,369
they have their own life and their own

285
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:41,479
struggle so some philosophers such as a

286
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,879
scope and power believe that empathic

287
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,220
emotions such as compassion are possible

288
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,529
because we are all part of a greater

289
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,259
ontological whole I really love that

290
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:53,899
idea a lot of my own spirituality kind

291
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,459
of comes from the idea that we're all

292
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:58,039
part of this this greater thing I don't

293
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,869
know what that is and I don't know that

294
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:02,089
anyone really knows what it is but we're

295
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:06,259
all kind of connected but it's important

296
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:08,269
to remember that while our ability to

297
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:11,809
feel empathy may be soft wire our

298
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:14,269
ability to act on it is a lot trade

299
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:16,909
we're wired for a lot of things we're

300
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,309
wired for love we're wired for hate

301
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:23,239
we're wired for hunger we're wired to be

302
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:26,029
able to learn things but but even just

303
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:27,799
learning as an example is something that

304
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:30,769
you need to learn just because we are

305
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,709
set up to empathize doesn't mean that we

306
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,669
know what to do with those emotions

307
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:44,280
another little break

308
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,700
so let's talk about learning empathy

309
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,190
expressing care for another is not an

310
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,380
innate ability present more naturally in

311
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,240
some people than others but rather a

312
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,890
skill that can be taught and nurtured

313
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,450
through a supportive educational

314
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,120
environment this is from a paper that

315
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,380
you can find at the end of my slides

316
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,220
McClellan proposes that we have to teach

317
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,690
students we have to teach individuals

318
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,330
how to empathize that part of our school

319
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,490
system should be giving people the tools

320
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,890
that they need to empathize with

321
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,010
individuals and it turns out that

322
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,080
empathy was something that I had to

323
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,790
learn so this is a younger me I see

324
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,800
pretty great style I wish I still had

325
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,540
that sweater I was not exactly a problem

326
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,940
child but I wasn't you know the easiest

327
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,570
person to get along with I wasn't really

328
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,240
observant of other people around me and

329
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,790
I went through a lot of life not having

330
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,380
a ton of meaningful relationships for

331
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:54,770
this and then I met Kristina she's wired

332
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,650
very differently than I am she patiently

333
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,850
taught me how to be in zurvan

334
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,250
she's the kind of person who takes on

335
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,380
other people's emotions and it was just

336
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,210
not something that was natural to me

337
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,250
sharing my life with someone has made me

338
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,740
a better person and it's made me more

339
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,340
empathetic

340
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,040
I personally improve that this can be

341
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,140
learned just because you may not be

342
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,000
great at it today doesn't mean that you

343
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,820
can't be great at it tomorrow and I want

344
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,950
to even speculate but I don't have any

345
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,840
scientific research to back me up on

346
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,060
that individuals who are maybe not

347
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,760
hardwired for empathy as much I believe

348
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,650
that they can learn it with patience and

349
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,700
with love it's important to remember

350
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,070
that while our ability to feel empathy

351
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,040
may be soft wire wired our ability to

352
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,410
act on it is a learnt trait ask yourself

353
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,590
Who am I

354
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:55,220
who is the other how are they another

355
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,410
how do we relate what do we share and

356
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,779
what do they need from me and I from

357
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:09,600
them take a second this idea the other

358
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,430
is actually a really important one and

359
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,250
it's really baked into our culture of

360
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,350
the world to think about other people as

361
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,390
an other and not as an ontological hole

362
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,940
we have others in in religion we have

363
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,880
others in nation-states we have others

364
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,300
in that table versus this table but as

365
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,529
the saying goes we're not so different

366
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,570
you and I so empathy as a developer and

367
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,250
how the heck does this have anything to

368
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,150
do with left pad so there's three places

369
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,300
to focus on here the first is having

370
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,580
empathy for the people that you make

371
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,730
things for the other is to have empathy

372
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,160
for the people that you make things with

373
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,100
and finally and it's not always so

374
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,500
obvious is actually having empathy for

375
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,370
yourself so having empathy for the

376
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,530
people you make things for how can we do

377
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:05,670
that reliability is one people when

378
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,250
they're consuming api's need to know

379
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,560
that they can rely on you not breaking

380
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,439
them this is actually a huge thing and

381
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,160
people can act irrationally when their

382
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,929
things break and this was in my opinion

383
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,520
one of the worst things that happen in

384
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,959
left pad there was a contract and that

385
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,510
contract was broken all the other

386
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,949
emotions all the other pain kind of

387
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:27,620
stems from this in my own opinion is

388
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,360
people expect when they sit down to run

389
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,880
things that they'll work and that

390
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,960
contract that you have is not broken

391
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,890
performance and you'll notice that

392
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,320
performance comes after reliability but

393
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,880
it's important that things will run on

394
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,740
people's systems and run performing Li

395
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,120
and that it will be fast but again this

396
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,240
should never be instead of being

397
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,720
reliable platform support supporting

398
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,610
lots of different platforms you need to

399
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,160
have empathy for the person running some

400
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,710
random flavor of Linux you've never

401
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,890
heard of

402
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,570
they're trying to run your code too and

403
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,000
you don't necessarily know why or how

404
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,580
and and simply saying don't fix or won't

405
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,270
fix isn't always an answer and this is

406
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,460
always the hardest one but if you're

407
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,990
building software that other people are

408
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,300
using to remember to build for your

409
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,080
consumers and not for yourself

410
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,520
interesting problems are interesting and

411
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,680
it can be really easy to spend all of

412
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,480
your time trying to write the next cool

413
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,750
thing if the people who use your product

414
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,700
don't care about that that doesn't

415
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,340
really help there is a lone inventor

416
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,920
myth in technology and in the world at

417
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,679
times we react as if you know there's

418
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,720
one person who knows more than everyone

419
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,070
else

420
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,750
you know Steve Jobs and Apple is one

421
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,220
example of that where it maybe worked

422
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,340
maybe Linux I don't know I don't really

423
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,860
believe in it myself people know what

424
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,220
they want and it's not really fair to

425
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,960
just go and change things because you're

426
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,059
interested in a problem especially if

427
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:05,010
people are relying on you listen to them

428
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,120
listen to the people that you're working

429
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,950
that you're making stuff for because

430
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,420
they care and they know listen so how do

431
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,220
you have empathy for the people that you

432
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,880
make things with documentation and this

433
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,440
also seems like something that's for the

434
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,120
people who use your stuff but

435
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,679
documentation is important also for

436
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,450
people who are coming into your project

437
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,920
and want to work with you your

438
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,350
documentation of your process of your

439
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,950
onboarding of your relief strategy

440
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,920
documentation of how collaborators are

441
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,630
expected to work with each other your

442
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,550
code of conduct all of these things need

443
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,870
to be documented not just your AP is

444
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,270
testing without tests people cannot

445
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,429
contribute no one wants to write code

446
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:49,780
when they don't know that things are

447
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,809
gonna break tests are empathy it may not

448
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:54,460
seem like it but your tests are a way

449
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,320
that other people can work with you and

450
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,100
get things done onboarding how are you

451
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,660
onboarding people in the first day that

452
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,580
they're contributing to your project how

453
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,170
about the first week in the first month

454
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,540
you can have a ton of empathy and really

455
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,059
help your project be successful if you

456
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:12,220
can have this outline for people how do

457
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,260
people start contributing in the note

458
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,760
project we have a good first

459
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,770
Contribution label on github that you

460
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,570
can click on they'll give you a list of

461
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,310
issues that can be good to get started

462
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,830
with once they've started doing that how

463
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,780
did things land once they've started

464
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,890
contributing how do they get a

465
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,550
commitment having all of this documented

466
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,870
as we were talking about earlier is

467
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,580
really important but also having

468
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,890
everyone internally agree on this is

469
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,660
really important these aren't the kind

470
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,070
of things that you should be debating

471
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,930
and arguing about when people are just

472
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,160
trying to get started in trying to

473
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,550
contribute this is really important be a

474
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,450
good ally and I would argue that being a

475
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,620
good Ally one of the first things is

476
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,210
never actually identifying as an ally

477
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,410
and we could talk more about that later

478
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,780
if you're interested but being

479
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,000
supportive and therefore the various

480
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
kinds of people who want to come in and

481
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,480
working on your project is one of the

482
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,980
most important things that you can do

483
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,620
sitting there and and looking at the

484
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,630
individuals and seeing what's blocking

485
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,190
them seeing what's hurting them seeing

486
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,800
what's driving them away you need to fix

487
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,170
that and you need to be willing to do

488
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,570
the hard things to do that and again

489
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,940
listen to them listen to the people that

490
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,590
you're working with if the people that

491
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,630
you're working with have a problem or

492
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,820
feel uncomfortable there's a reason for

493
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,240
that

494
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,930
and you need to change and having

495
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,820
empathy for yourself and this is to me

496
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,590
one of the most important parts because

497
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,200
burnout is alive and well and I don't

498
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,060
know how many can I get a raise of hands

499
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,990
of people who have felt like they've

500
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,690
burnt out before look around the room

501
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,620
it's a real thing set healthy boundaries

502
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,090
you don't need to have an all green

503
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,310
github chart I mean they remove that

504
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,050
that streak thing and I think that's one

505
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,370
of the most amazing thing and things

506
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,500
they ever did but set healthy boundaries

507
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,560
for yourself listen to your body if

508
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,860
you're tired sleep one of the tricks

509
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,110
that I started doing when I went to grad

510
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,760
school was instead of trying to pull an

511
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,050
all-nighter I would actually just go to

512
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,640
sleep early and then would go to sleep

513
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,410
early and wake up super early and get a

514
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,450
ton of work done in the morning if you

515
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,820
feel like you need to sleep sleep there

516
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,770
isn't any one thing unless you're

517
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,180
working in a mission-critical thing

518
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,560
that's going to kill a human being there

519
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,850
is nothing that's more important than

520
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,730
taking care of yourself be aware of

521
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,130
impostor syndrome I still suffer from it

522
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,510
every single day it's real

523
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,220
easy when you're working on an

524
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,080
interesting and difficult things and

525
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,090
surrounding yourself with more people

526
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,320
who are working on interesting and

527
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,110
different difficult things to just feel

528
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,810
like you're not capable the amazing

529
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,880
thing about the software role that I

530
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,140
would argue may be many other

531
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,610
professions as well but I don't know as

532
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,870
deeply is that we're really just

533
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,340
constantly learning all the things we

534
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,740
don't know you can't be expected to know

535
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,470
everything and at the same time you

536
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,880
can't be expected to know all the things

537
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,320
that your colleagues know that's why we

538
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,400
work together because we all have

539
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,920
different skills stop psyching yourself

540
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,810
out you're all awesome every single one

541
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,770
of you I don't even need to meet you I

542
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,640
know it listen to yourself don't doubt

543
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,340
your gut your gut knows what to do and

544
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,000
if something feels wrong run with that

545
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,890
figure out why it feels wrong if you

546
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,120
don't feel comfortable or something

547
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,290
listen to yourself so let's bring it all

548
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,700
back before we wrap up here well we may

549
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,700
be soft wired for empathy the term has

550
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,540
only existed for about a hundred years

551
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,830
Theresa's Wiseman's definition of

552
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,080
empathy and the attributes are

553
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,750
understanding perspective staying out of

554
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,630
judgment recognizing what others are

555
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,060
feeling and communicating it back this

556
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,640
is not the same as feeling for someone

557
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,740
this is feeling with them you don't even

558
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,720
need to say anything you just need to

559
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,720
understand and be supportive it is

560
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,880
important to remember while our ability

561
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,160
to feel empathy may be soft wired our

562
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,720
ability to act on it is a lunt trait

563
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,220
empathizing requires you to be

564
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,110
vulnerable and that can be scary empathy

565
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,020
is a choice and this is one of the most

566
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,060
important things you have to choose to

567
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,430
empathize with individuals it doesn't

568
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,800
just happen

569
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,100
ask not how am i unique but rather how

570
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,710
are we the same break down those

571
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,170
barriers stop mothering we are all the

572
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,270
same we are all on the spaceship earth

573
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:36,560
together feel with people rarely can a

574
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,200
response make something better what

575
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,670
makes something better is connection

576
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:47,600
maybe what you say doesn't matter maybe

577
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,450
the only thing that matters in the end

578
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,210
are the relationships you built
