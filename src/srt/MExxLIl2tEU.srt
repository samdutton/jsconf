hi my name is Alvaro i am from other way

2
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,660
originally but bimbo I mean living

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,540
abroad since seven years first in China

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,850
for three years building a big website

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,029
like a big dating site for Germany from

6
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:27,430
there I moved to Switzerland since four

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,919
years i'm living there and i work for

8
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:32,619
RabbitMQ i wrote the book about RabbitMQ

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,390
and i also work for the core team of

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,750
rabid rabid EMU is messaging and queuing

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,940
server the idea is that you can delay

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,100
processing of tasks for example in your

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,530
in your website like just a canonical

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,140
example like your images instead of

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,820
researching them while the user is

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,460
waiting you can just kill them and send

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,739
a message to a worker that could be

18
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:59,350
written in no door closure java whatever

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,620
and then do the oldest processing in the

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,720
background to save resources on the

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,590
front ends so rabbitmq is actually

22
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,520
written in ireland but is implements a

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,950
protocol called n QP advanced message in

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,650
queue in protocol which has clients in

25
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,720
many languages for for example

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,979
javascript java and PHP closure python

27
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:27,220
ruby and so on so users can actually

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,020
benefit a lot from this because they can

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,450
have the front ends in node and today's

30
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,780
like very fashion to have micro services

31
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,790
and you can have your own micro service

32
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,130
like for resizing images in java let's

33
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,250
say one for sending emails in know Jas

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,840
and you can mix and match all these

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,450
languages very easily thanks to RabbitMQ

36
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,880
and entropy the talk was about doing

37
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,549
replication with RabbitMQ so i gave like

38
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:55,630
a brief intro of how n QP works and then

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,670
jumped into how to do replication would

40
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,770
rabbit with the tools provided by by the

41
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,680
server i actually my first time here was

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,590
this november for a different conference

43
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,030
and this is my second time we went

44
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,860
inside effectively so it's very

45
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,430
interesting yes it's quite a like amount

46
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,239
of video that took a more bit on inside

47
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,440
I think in the area of rabbit for

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
example the main thing today might be

49
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,989
the micro services like more and more

50
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:28,549
architectures are moving to the cloud

51
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,370
and to have this very small micro

52
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,080
services that you can deploy for example

53
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,000
with doctor or using cloud foundry or

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,819
this kind of tools and rabbitmq will

55
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,790
become like a core part they're 2 to do

56
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,760
all this message in synchronization

57
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,980
moving data around the time I travel a

58
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,840
lot actually and go to many conferences

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,090
and I'm really really surprised by the

60
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,360
venue by all the the billboards

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,090
announcing how to get here I mean she's

62
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,860
just those small details that make the

63
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,620
conference a better experience for for

64
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,470
users and big tops are a great they have

65
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,680
a great selection of speakers I mean the

66
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,480
creator of javascript is here so what

67
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,540
else to ask and the location is wait so
