1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,130

wait for this i thi this is really

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,540
intense right here um so uh everyone

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:21,539
welcome to HTML comp 2000 can everyone

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,810
see my screen okay awesome so um I was

5
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,119
explaining to a very good friend of mine

6
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,540
former co-worker why I was not in New

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,610
Jersey yesterday and I said that I was

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,040
additional cough which she said so it's

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,540
like the Tom Hanks the web dev

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,920
conferences which is now the new

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,559
official tagline of d HTML com so we

12
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,489
also have Tom Hanks is a sponsor so yeah

13
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,969
I curated this thing Michael had me come

14
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,590
out March of 1999 to speak at the

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,920
first-ever d HTML cough which was in San

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,350
Francisco so now we're like bicoastal

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,130
right and so I had given a talk called

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,360
malware injection proof your front-end

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,070
code in three easy steps or D HTML

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,330
ancestors don't want us to know about

21
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,400
and we had like some scheduling issues

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,259
and we had some extra time and he's like

23
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,700
well why don't you just give that talk

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,590
again so we can record it and I was like

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,659
yeah that's a good idea but a lot has

26
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,040
happened since March so I figured I'd

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,229
updated a bit but just to go through a

28
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,049
couple of things I taught in march was

29
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,479
the shipper wave web development which

30
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,180
is something that I feel like is

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,750
everyone's goal as a developer sort of

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,090
our endgame for why we create apps and

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,680
web development so I always try to

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,770
remember these different facets of it

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,570
but there's definitely a threat to the

36
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,100
shipper wave of development and that is

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,920
primarily malware malware is

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,689
counterproductive to this design pattern

39
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,490
it's a waste of time it causes us to

40
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,030
lose money resources it makes our web

41
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,979
brings not look so cool if all the

42
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,390
sudden Chrome's telling you that there's

43
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,370
you know malware on it and it's

44
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,840
especially rampant

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,099
those of us who develop with HTML which

46
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,700
makes sense being that the d stands for

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,330
dangerous and in America HTML is

48
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,340
something that has been plaguing our

49
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,209
teens and ourselves and we just don't

50
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,920
know that much about it obviously so

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,840
it's time that we start focusing more on

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,879
malware and getting rid of it and

53
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,230
preventing it and those are really only

54
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,910
the three simple steps to making sure

55
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,299
that our d HTML content isn't full of

56
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,030
gross pneus so fine how do you find

57
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,500
malware will you ask someone to do that

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,660
how do you get rid of it you delete it

59
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,730
and how do you prevent it and this is

60
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,260
another thing that I introduced back in

61
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,940
March and that's called the virus method

62
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,280
for preventing malware in our code so

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,040
for vaccination we make our sites look

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,840
like the site is already infected with

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,870
malware so like this is this is this is

66
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,549
back when I worked at the NBA and this

67
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,930
is what the NBA site look like you could

68
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,160
also put a virus on your site already

69
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,600
because nobody is going to infect your

70
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,220
site if it's already infected that's

71
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,840
crazy it's like if you have the flu the

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
flu is not going to get you at the same

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,000
time that just doesn't happen

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,859
interrogation I introduced this concept

75
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,920
earlier year called to ask a cop method

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,500
because we all know that if you ask a

77
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,419
cop if they're a cop they have to tell

78
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,520
you here's some JavaScript

79
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,070
so basically you just say like are you

80
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,170
malware and like the Malheur has to say

81
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,510
yes or no and then you just follow suit

82
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,940
recursion is just passing work on to

83
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,820
another computer if you don't have a

84
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,560
master's in computer science like I do

85
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,120
this is probably a little bit too

86
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,560
difficult of the concept but I created a

87
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,080
bookmarklet where you can just put your

88
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,790
site into the bookmarklet and then when

89
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,320
they click the bookmarklet the site

90
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,380
shows up on the page so it's also really

91
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,790
good we're like you don't have to worry

92
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,380
about dealing with putting your site on

93
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,890
the clouds and stuff like that you can

94
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,360
also use w3schools to show your site by

95
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,060
giving snippet of code to them and then

96
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,280
they can go into the try it yourself

97
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,960
editor and put the code in there and

98
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,390
then you see your site right over here

99
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,220
so also you're like avoiding clouds and

100
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,020
therefore like you're not paying for

101
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,450
things and that's just really useful in

102
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,520
w3schools isn't going anywhere as far as

103
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,910
I know there are other things that you

104
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,460
can do avoiding different types of file

105
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,950
extensions I had reasons for this but I

106
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,130
don't know but just trust me don't use

107
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,250
vim use HTM instead of HTML because

108
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,290
there was really no malware on sites

109
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,510
back when we've used HTM so I think that

110
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,669
that L kind of like things up for

111
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:13,720
us and then finally confused malware

112
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,550
because there's an S and virus or

113
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,130
whatever framesets if your site's full

114
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,840
of framesets there's more places for

115
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,640
malware to have to try to find some more

116
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,440
frames that you have in your page the

117
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,470
harder it is your cool horizontal

118
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,930
scrolling so horizontal scrolling that

119
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,390
like photographers love this like it's

120
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,370
really hard to like access that as a

121
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,710
human so like if a human can't access it

122
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,020
or if you use non semantic tags and like

123
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,970
machine can't read it then like you

124
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,410
don't have to worry about viruses trying

125
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,000
to read it image only development is

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,250
also something that I introduced

127
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,480
personally over the past year and it's

128
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,669
if your site's just an image then the

129
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:56,620
malware can't go anywhere so you really

130
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,000
should just start using images

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,120
everywhere which one of my talks

132
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,130
that we're going to have today involves

133
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,530
like pixels and that's those are an

134
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,360
images so it should be good and use

135
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,760
entities instead of tags so you don't

136
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,350
have to have like less than greater than

137
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,600
symbols in your HTML just use entities

138
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,580
and yeah you're going to see HTML on the

139
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,380
page but we're all developers we know

140
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,220
what that turns into so yeah so I

141
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,500
introduced the shipper way the virus

142
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,060
method and talked about how we should be

143
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,669
serious about malware but none of you

144
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,760
listened because here we are today and

145
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,310
the world is still full of malware and

146
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm really used to people like listening

147
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,330
to what I say so I'm a little ticked off

148
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,470
right now so that's why the rest of my

149
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,570
talk now is the state of the malware and

150
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,940
I'm going to give you some examples of

151
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,860
malware that we've encountered this year

152
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,570
and then hopefully you can take this

153
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,570
information and go home and take a long

154
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,090
hard look in the mirror and be ashamed

155
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:02,229
of yourselves so horribly heartbleed um

156
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:08,139
was this malware and open SSL it's I

157
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:10,930
don't know it has a nice logo secrets

158
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,560
were leaked that was in cool shell shock

159
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,490
the new order album that came out in 86

160
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,160
I thought that they were remastering but

161
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,289
like it turns out that has nothing to do

162
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,449
with new order

163
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,860
it was this like vulnerability in bash

164
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,120
ExtremeTech called it a deadly new

165
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,490
vulnerability I don't know what was

166
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,770
updated about it but all I know is it

167
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,960
sounded scary what was leave probably

168
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,139
secrets I don't know I'm running that

169
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,939
time so I'm gonna not going to go

170
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:46,539
through the rest of these other so here

171
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:52,150
we are today here we are today at the

172
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,860
HTML comp 2000 and it's this has been

173
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,020
this is the first time back in March

174
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,210
that I gave us at arikil talk and I'm

175
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,589
here in front of you giving a serious

176
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:06,849
one but I feel I feel like I've got five

177
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,969
awesome speakers and talk to you about a

178
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:13,900
whole variety of things pixels Jurassic

179
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,270
Park came up I saw Jurassic Park and

180
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,839
said yes I don't care what it's about

181
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,120
ariat subculture in the early 2000s a

182
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,860
