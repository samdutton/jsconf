made available in the future and is a

165
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,839

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,920
of maintaining backward compatibility

171
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:29,610

175
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,640
shipped a very complete API trying to

176
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,010
push modular and reusable code pieces to

177
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,839
build websites in your browser similar

178
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:59,779
to this proposed standard that's a tough

179
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:04,820
one does the audience know I eat 5.5

180
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:12,800
it's about back right oh wow nobody else

181
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,450
in where's I for you know right modular

182
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,130
and reusable pieces maybe think about

183
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,839
the standard that does this today or

184
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:27,269
wants to I heard it from the audience

185
