1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,010

okay so um this is about like it's about

2
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,170
relationships the relationships that you

3
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,310
have with your debugger and sometimes

4
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,110
those relationships change I know that a

5
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,160
you know two years ago I was amazingly

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,949
into Firebug and now I kind of seen

7
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:44,370
someone else a little bit but the thing

8
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,280
is that you really want to you know get

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,019
in touch you know with your partner and

10
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:52,079
like know all you know everything

11
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,130
everything you can know about your

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,340
partner is good well anyways we're going

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,329
to learn a little bit about chrome

14
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,460
devtools firstly about me I work for a

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,390
browser I'll give you two guesses I am

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,280
the lead developer on moderniser i'm on

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,710
the jquery team i create html5

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,530
boilerplate there's a bear we'll get

19
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,160
back to that okay right so I'm going to

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,130
open up the chrome devtools here on this

21
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,100
page can you guys see this in the back

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:29,400
no ok good let's take this and then

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,810
we'll just turn that one and go yeah

24
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,670
that's pretty good better yeah great

25
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,570
yeah so I thought it'd be a little bit

26
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,509
more fun to kind of have the the

27
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,390
devtools kind of be like my slide so I'm

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,159
making I'm having some fun here i have

29
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,500
the wait a second tag and the where are

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,509
the divs and the Omega tag but we'll go

31
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,060
down to uh we're going to do some

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,439
styling stuff first so I'm just going to

33
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,299
show like a bunch of features that the

34
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,280
chrome devtools has you might not know

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,500
about some of these are new and in

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,420
general the chrome dev channel has these

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,799
a lot sooner than everyone else and so

38
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,729
you're going to see features here

39
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,170
they're not available in the regular

40
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,660
chrome stable release yet but some of

41
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,140
them are so first in styling um a while

42
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,260
ago this was like um let me go over here

43
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,420
I wanted to set a background color and

44
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,450
I'd be like background and I hit tab and

45
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,879
you said they didn't we didn't have that

46
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,170
coal in there and so you actually had to

47
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:28,920
type the colon

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,950
really annoying so anyways that's all

49
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,340
better so now we can tab you know tab to

50
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,330
make the next one cool cool no big deal

51
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,380
but where this gets a little bit more

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,150
fun is that there's autocomplete right

53
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,890
which is good because sometimes we

54
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,569
forget how background is spelled or

55
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,790
sometimes you want to type the most

56
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,680
delicious color in the history of colors

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,180
which is papayawhip so good and on top

58
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,620
of that you might put another color like

59
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,390
one that's particularly difficult to

60
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,110
spell which is fuchsia fuchsia oh I

61
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,060
touch it right the first time terrible

62
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,000
demo fuchsia is like is a really tough

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,489
one but the trick is it's fucsia but the

64
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,360
other chick is that it's also magenta so

65
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,299
you could just bypass that entirely but

66
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,910
now that we're here on colors um this

67
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,560
little color swatch you're like oh cool

68
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,420
color swatch great I kind of knew what

69
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,060
color that was but magic you click it

70
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,400
and you iterate through the different

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,420
color notations yeah I'm going to go

72
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,560
over like hsl and I like bring down the

73
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,060
yeah bring down the saturation a little

74
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,940
bit you just tweak this a little bit and

75
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,790
then maybe go back to hex and then copy

76
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,870
that back in your style sheet because

77
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,299
that's how it's how you roll so you got

78
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:52,700
some fun there also let's say that you

79
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,850
want to do some crazy cool patterns and

80
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,959
I'm going to grab my favoritest one this

81
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,060
is a this is it's just CSS gradients

82
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,299
right here and this one is actually a

83
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,019
divyam anyen who I work with on each my

84
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:10,920
boiler plate and some other stuff

85
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,500
created this it's out of gradients it's

86
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,450
just mind-blowing so anyways I'm gonna

87
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,519
bring this over here I'm going to apply

88
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,240
it to the body yeah buddy whoo looks

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,180
pretty good now you'll notice if you've

90
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,770
done CSS gradients before or like

91
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,780
anything where there's a long value and

92
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,160
sometimes you'll be hacking it in the

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,660
dev tools and you'll you'll screw it up

94
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,500
and what used to happen is that it would

95
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,909
just disappear and you'd lose your work

96
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,830
and now there's this little arrow e

97
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,440
and he's like yo you mess this up you

98
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,850
should probably fix that so you get a

99
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,530
chance to to UM fix that which which is

100
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,790
good but the other thing that you'll see

101
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,770
is that you'll see like mods prefixed

102
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,300
stuff showing up in the dev tools now

103
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,210
and that might throw you for a loop but

104
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:04,270
it's actually okay yeah let me uh wow

105
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,010
that pattern is pretty nice i'm going to

106
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,110
move on past it so one of the way that

107
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,940
this gets really cool is so let's say

108
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,920
that I I'm going to add some styles here

109
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,990
to this this guy and I'm going to give

110
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:27,190
him outline 10 10 picks solid badass

111
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,120
yeah that's pretty good a little bit of

112
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,890
marg maybe okay cool so yeah I just

113
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,210
added it here in the devtools I'm seeing

114
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,790
it live cool this is what we like right

115
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,350
now I'm going to go over to resources

116
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,040
tab and oh this is new we now group the

117
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,540
resources under your like font style

118
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,250
sheet scripts and it's not one huge

119
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,410
lists group now well you'll notice that

120
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,210
there's also this little arrow next to

121
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,240
the style dot CSS and you like what cuz

122
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,400
i click it and it's actually keeping

123
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,230
revisions of all the changes that i'm

124
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,420
making over here it's keeping revisions

125
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,610
and i can like right click and revert

126
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,590
back to an earlier thing if i wanted to

127
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,990
but if it's keeping revisions then that

128
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,050
means that it must be keeping track of

129
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,990
my changes here so all my all my

130
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,260
manipulations over on this side are now

131
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,120
being carried through to the style sheet

132
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,610
with dipping so i can see exactly like

133
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,390
what I change what I removed and so you

134
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,040
know I can tweak whatever I want go over

135
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,400
here and and just right click save as

136
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,260
and save this file back to you know

137
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,180
where I'm at it gets

138
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,360
agreed it gets better so while it is

139
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,210
pretty cool that uh that you know we can

140
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,740
change things over here and go back here

141
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,720
and we have that would be nicer if we

142
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,370
could just kind of do it all operate in

143
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,039
the same place so now if you just double

144
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,320
click and now you can just freeform edit

145
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,229
all you like well that's pretty good

146
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:06,560
color let's go back to papayawhip yeah

147
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,560
hmm so double click freeform style sheet

148
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,690
editing make your manipulations they

149
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,110
happen completely on the fly slate blue

150
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,509
and you get the live preview and then

151
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:22,979
you get a chance to save it out just

152
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:29,870
pretty cool that's ugly Oh clear okay

153
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,740
let's go over the JavaScript side of

154
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,710
things um logging yes okay console.log i

155
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,120
do want to point out this is worthwhile

156
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,000
that well most people when you start

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,409
logging you're like oh because i can use

158
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,110
console.log instead of alert and you

159
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,639
forget that console.log takes multiple

160
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,530
arguments and you can send anything that

161
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,630
you want to it so you know take full

162
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,250
advantage of that but in addition to log

163
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,770
there are a lot of things on the console

164
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,520
that help you out so basically all the

165
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,360
debuggers dragonfly IE dev tools Firebug

166
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,389
than the chrome dev tools all support

167
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,580
pretty much most of the console api

168
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,550
which was you know came out of Firebug

169
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,340
basically so things like warren and air

170
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,979
or just basically console logs with

171
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,349
shiny icons but there are more

172
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:26,009
interesting ones and so here's a test

173
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,289
page made by joke hewitt who created

174
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:32,339
Firebug and this is just um these are

175
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,329
just calling like console dot time

176
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:38,550
council about time end just you know

177
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,079
records the amount of time something

178
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:42,450
took another one that I really like is

179
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,790
console that trace gives you the stack

180
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,220
trace of wherever you are

181
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,329
throws that out to the console so

182
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,560
there's a lot there's a lot on the

183
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,149
console object but then there's actually

184
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,790
cooler stuff there's the command line

185
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,509
API and so there's functions available

186
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:03,689
to you down in here so for instance like

187
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:06,019
console dot der is available as der

188
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,430
which is good because you'll have

189
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,170
something like ducking body and if you

190
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,079
do document.body you get like the tree

191
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,129
and you can expand the tree but

192
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,160
sometimes you want like the dom view

193
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,490
Sodor gives you that where you actually

194
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,069
like get it as a Dom object and you can

195
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:25,139
look into that but there's cooler thing

196
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:29,430
so let's say say so I have document.body

197
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,920
and actually i have this reference to to

198
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,420
this dom element but i want to inspect

199
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,000
it over in in my elements tab and

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,769
document body's pretty easy to find but

201
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:39,240
sometimes it gets a little bit harder so

202
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,069
you can actually just use the inspect

203
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:44,009
method and it just jumps you over to

204
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,589
there and throws you onto the body which

205
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:49,970
is pretty cool other times you'll have a

206
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,649
reference you'll be selecting you know

207
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,660
this guy I've just brought up the

208
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,209
console I hit escape escape brings up

209
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:58,769
the console on every single one of these

210
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,100
tabs and sometimes like a while ago I

211
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,870
remember I like had it there like go

212
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,769
away just drag it all the way escape pro

213
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:10,860
tip so I'm selecting this guy right here

214
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,059
I just do dollar zero and dollar zero

215
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,829
refers to whatever element is currently

216
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:20,160
selected up there and it's just like a

217
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,230
regular Dom element so oh it's just a

218
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,529
regular reference so i can just do a

219
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:31,649
dollar zero dot inner text or whatever

220
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,240
so in addition to that guy like let's

221
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,779
say I'm going over here and we also have

222
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,269
a copy method and this is pretty cool so

223
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:47,490
you'll have something like a inner HTML

224
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,930
yeah okay soup and sometimes you'll have

225
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,980
a big string and you want to actually

226
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,990
like copy that somewhere and and while

227
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,220
you could you know select yeah you know

228
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,810
clicking into select is

229
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,529
we pass a so we can just call copy and

230
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,779
copy that to the clipboard go over here

231
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,940
paste it out so there's yeah there's

232
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,610
some pretty cool shortcuts to save you

233
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,760
some time there keys is also another one

234
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,060
it shows you all the the the properties

235
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,350
on an object all the methods and

236
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,420
properties so pass it like document and

237
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,150
it is gives me everything there so keys

238
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,589
and values also yeah so over on the

239
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,920
Firebug wiki is the full list of command

240
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,990
line API oh my god i just found out this

241
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,839
one the other day ryan said in the CSS

242
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,360
ninja showed me this CD so this is not

243
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,029
implemented by chrome but i'm really

244
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:42,960
we're going to do it because I'm just

245
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,839
it's so rad so you pass it a reference

246
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,970
to a window basically you pass it a

247
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,320
reference to like an iframe and then so

248
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,250
you'll be like CD and then I frame ref

249
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:00,120
and then after that everything that you

250
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,040
type operates within the context of that

251
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,990
iframe so you don't have to do that

252
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,760
nasty traversal thing absolutely every

253
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,020
time you want to run code you can just

254
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,080
CD into the iframe xeu code inside of

255
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,860
that and then CD top so you know go back

256
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,170
out it's pretty cool so available in

257
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,410
Firebug that's it but it's coming out of

258
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:27,660
the places soon all right as for do a

259
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,670
little bit of debugging I want to show

260
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,940
off some pretty cool script stuff so i

261
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,400
have this page here and this is just a

262
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,240
list of the developer advocates at at

263
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,760
google and you know I can sort and

264
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,010
that's pretty cool so if I want to

265
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,470
figure out what's going on inside here

266
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:51,650
I'm going to go into the scripts tab

267
00:12:51,660 --> 00:13:11,660
break it it's cool let's see oh there is

268
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:20,120
i'm running a developer builds ah great

269
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,920
thank you for sticking with me ok so I'm

270
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,940
over here in the app code for the page I

271
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,860
actually know what line I want to go do

272
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,870
so i can just jump right down to it I'm

273
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,480
in command l which is go to line this

274
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,910
also works over in CSS so I'm going to

275
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,380
jump down there there's a few shortcuts

276
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,220
available you can hit ? right in the dev

277
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,510
tools and get a display of a few of them

278
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,410
so I'm down here in my code and one of

279
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,200
the cool things that you can do now is

280
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,370
edit the script live on the fly so I can

281
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,740
just double-click and then just I don't

282
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,210
know I'm going to like console log out

283
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,440
whatever is coming into here that's

284
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,150
pretty cool so now as I manipulate this

285
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:16,290
stuff others the argument cuts gets

286
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,600
logged out or maybe I want to do

287
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,130
something a little bit cooler like maybe

288
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:37,440
do if this guy is feed entry 0 yes

289
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,510
equals Irish yes document

290
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,990
that body style that background equals

291
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,150
something pretty sweet think that I work

292
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:06,940
I think that work whoo nice definite

293
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,120
improvement so yeah so you can do live

294
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,670
editing right in there and of course I

295
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,790
go over to resources find this script

296
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,580
and the revisions have been saved as

297
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,460
well and I can go and say that out if a

298
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:30,250
lot pretty cool all right there's a few

299
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,590
more features that i want to show off do

300
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,910
i have three minutes is that what i have

301
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,710
i think of three minutes okay given that

302
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,900
i have three minutes come and talk to me

303
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,140
to see a some crazy breakpoint stuff

304
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,050
that you can do i do want to show this

305
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,460
is really rad there this is very recent

306
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,350
we're just announcing this now we now

307
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,820
have remote debugging ability in the

308
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,540
chrome devtools so if i run something

309
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,290
like this i run chromium with remote

310
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,800
debugging port leaped let's let's try

311
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:12,100
this out actually okay okay here's

312
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,410
chromium running out and now i'm going

313
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,340
to open up WebKit this is a nightly

314
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,780
WebKit okay so i just opened up so

315
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,430
what's happening is that chrome is

316
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,370
actually running a web server basically

317
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,960
and I can just these are all the tabs

318
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,730
that I have open right and I can just

319
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,100
I'm now this is you know the dev tools

320
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,470
is a web app I'm looking at the dev

321
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,940
tools of chrome with Safari nightly and

322
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,370
you know it just it works just like you

323
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,500
would want it to so this is really cool

324
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,410
right I mean this this is a this work

325
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,270
has been done all at the WebKit level so

326
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,019
that means of course

327
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:56,899
that all the mobile web kits are getting

328
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,660
this which means also the rim playbook

329
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,369
that just shipped has this feature

330
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:03,709
available where you just like turn it on

331
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,140
and you can just log in to your tablet

332
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,659
from your desktop machine and it's debug

333
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:18,049
it like you would want to yes I do all

334
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,569
like I said that the devtools is just a

335
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:25,549
web app like it's just a bunch of

336
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,039
JavaScript and it's really fun to read

337
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,799
around and one of the things i do want

338
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,250
to point out this is also brand-new over

339
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,350
if you download a chromium chromium

340
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,299
build usually find a page like this and

341
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:39,860
it's not the most user-friendly thing

342
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,270
but this is new dev tools dot front end

343
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,850
the zip is basically all these files

344
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,630
right here and you can now just run

345
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,210
chrome with this flag point it to that

346
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,399
folder and then just like hack on your

347
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,070
own devtools you know right rewriting

348
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,980
the JavaScript the styling and then just

349
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,330
play around with it and maybe you know

350
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,460
write a patch and and add a feature to

351
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,680
it so that we can make it even cooler

352
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,100
dev tools extensions are about to come

353
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,110
out google i/o is where we're going to

354
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,130
make that announcement that's going to

355
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,309
be really exciting and one last amazing

356
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:20,620
feature probably read it check this out

357
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,559
it's right over here or bring up the dev

358
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:41,680
tools well

359
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm going to bring up yes this one okay

360
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,480
