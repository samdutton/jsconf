00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,620

good morning so we managed to get a

2
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,870
bunch of working with screens that's

3
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,179
impressive it's always really hard so

4
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:53,230
today I'll be talking about some of the

5
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,690
approaches you can take modularity for

6
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,969
building frontin apps these approaches

7
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:02,719
are agnostic from like your particular

8
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,770
choice of package manager guy has done a

9
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,439
great ton of work with JSP em these

10
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,900
texts Inc you know work just fine with

11
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,360
any good package manager and in fact

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,490
this box with that one was great it

13
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,890
showed exactly what to do have a huge

14
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,860
tree and have like 120 kilobytes of

15
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,630
JavaScript at the minimum that's

16
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,409
definitely like the way to go solo about

17
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,159
me I'm ray knows I've done a lot of

18
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,229
stuff in node and in the browser with

19
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,990
NPM sometimes I think you have a little

20
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,390
bit of an addiction to open source I've

21
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,159
written at least like a hundred modules

22
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,619
targeted at the browser and as approach

23
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,920
to be working great for me so we'll go

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,649
over a bit of an overview of the things

25
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:51,200
i'll be talking about so the first thing

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,509
is like how did you get started with

27
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:57,380
modules how to use them guy pretty much

28
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,930
covered this already so we'll just place

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,189
for that the second part is what does it

30
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:07,520
mean to offer small modules and why what

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,280
are the benefits of like offering these

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,010
small micro modules instead of offering

33
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,860
like big libraries or larger

34
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,850
we'll take a look at a similar example

35
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,430
to what guys showed which is just you

36
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,250
know you can embed things with CSS and

37
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,380
assets and like self-contained and we'll

38
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,030
just work and I will talk a bit about

39
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,780
how you can build your own flexible

40
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,330
framework from modules I'll talk more

41
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,800
about what i mean by framework later

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,800
cool so some of the tools of the trade

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,630
i'll be discussing and I've used these

44
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,160
are you don't need these you need

45
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,910
anything that's equivalent let's just

46
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,360
get a bit of a quizzing in questions

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,110
going who's here well everybody's

48
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,190
already heard of em p.m. because was

49
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,060
mentioned who's his used em p.m. before

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,070
that's that's a good number well I

51
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,320
browserify who hears her too much about

52
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,560
UNIX philosophy and how great this okay

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,080
okay cool so quick recap em PM's place

54
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,019
with JavaScript now one of the really

55
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,560
cool things about NPM is it's so easy to

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,920
publish you go home at some code and hit

57
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,910
em can publish it's done no waiting no

58
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,410
no gatekeepers no nothing the other

59
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,790
thing is really nice is avoiding the

60
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,140
pendency hell mpm is managed to get the

61
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,340
nest of the paintings to work search

62
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,209
that you don't run into version complex

63
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,739
which is kind of important because as

64
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:57,140
you start doing modular things you're

65
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,060
going to have multiple things at

66
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,790
different versions and you don't want to

67
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,040
have to think about conflicts or worry

68
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,320
about that you want to just work

69
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,940
browserify you can write comment Jess it

70
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,519
bounces into one file and everything

71
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,220
just works it's great now one of the

72
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,630
things i do recommend checking out is

73
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,209
this browser by handbook substract rode

74
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,669
over last week so it's like sub stacks

75
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,200
browser by handbook and he's written

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,720
like pages and pages and pages and pages

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,390
but really really does too much there

78
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:36,270
it's too much and I'll saying I

79
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,320
mentioned is that a lot of my

80
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,660
inspiration comes from some unique

81
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,390
philosophies this one is the quote about

82
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,350
modularity and to sum it up it suggests

83
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,750
that you should use small things and

84
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,600
click them together and one of the

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,810
biggest thing that says is the pot the

86
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,990
pot is really important here is like

87
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,540
this the spot here as you start using

88
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,440
small things they can be replaced you're

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,390
going to run into oh that was a

90
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,710
mistake I shouldn't have used that Faye

91
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,620
nothing was terrible the other thing is

92
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,580
I have a bad habit or feeling like I

93
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,920
want to be able to maintain and read all

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,500
my dependencies because I have a feeling

95
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,700
that as officers are going to get hit by

96
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,669
buses or they're just going to abandon

97
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,870
stuff on github which happens that habit

98
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,740
so much and if something is small it is

99
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,110
a lot easier to be able to be

100
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,300
comfortable that no matter what happens

101
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,740
i can continue working with this but

102
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,030
also helps if it's not written in

103
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,130
CoffeeScript but that's just a personal

104
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,100
thing for me okay cool so when using

105
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,010
modules why so one of the big things

106
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,640
that I love about this approach is I get

107
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,070
to just pick the best everything like I

108
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,350
don't have to make a compromise I don't

109
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,850
have to pick a large thing and go like

110
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,090
well I like eighty percent I just won't

111
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,840
touch you out of twenty percent I don't

112
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,140
have to deal with that I get to really

113
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,010
drive also drive my architecture and my

114
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,590
design of application around what I

115
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,740
wanted to be rather than what some of

116
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,660
the tools I pick off the shelf of

117
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,260
telling me how telling me to do I'm

118
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,660
useful exactly what you need no more so

119
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,280
that lower own kilobytes in theory

120
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,289
sometimes doesn't work out in practice

121
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:49,620
and lower on complexity so just knowing

122
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,020
that you don't have these really large

123
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,400
things you dependency tree you don't

124
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,340
have to worry about them you don't have

125
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:06,629
to worry about upgrading them whenever I

126
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:10,009
used some of these big libraries

127
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,810
whenever a new major version came round

128
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,719
I had to spend a couple of days updating

129
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:20,430
my app with your small modules the scope

130
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,199
of what you have to deal with is way

131
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,360
smaller and you can operate them more

132
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,449
easily and obviously freedom like

133
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,639
freedom to switch whenever you find

134
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,379
something that works better for

135
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,330
application whenever I build an

136
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,370
application I don't know what it's going

137
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,919
to be like I have an idea in my head of

138
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,120
how it's going to work but it's always

139
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,870
wrong I need to have the freedom to be

140
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,650
able to adapt and move as I start

141
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,699
understand application better and so

142
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,340
modules are great but they're hard to

143
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,979
find like when you start out you don't

144
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,210
know where they are you don't know which

145
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,969
ones to use which was a good which was a

146
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:09,419
non good and honestly one of the best

147
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,219
approaches to figuring out what the good

148
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:13,169
motors are is you go and talk to

149
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:15,240
somebody like you talk to them is

150
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,159
seatalk on Twitter you talk to Mellie

151
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:21,240
conference failing that mpm search does

152
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,419
wonders I'm gonna try and use mpm search

153
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,580
later and see where it actually gives me

154
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,479
what I want hope it does and then the

155
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,130
last part is there's a whole bunch of

156
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,800
these groupings and collections on

157
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,669
github and other websites where people

158
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,789
have gone and I phone small modules

159
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,730
together in like one bucket it's

160
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,279
basically like a list it's like a wiki

161
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,130
page and these actually work wonders and

162
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,350
you can kind of see what's work for

163
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,760
other people

164
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,170
some other people claim it if you're

165
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,470
going to like build stuff with WebGL

166
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,000
like all these things do good stuff I

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,160
don't know anything on WebGL but if I

168
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,370
wanted to try and start there I best you

169
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,220
go down and in fact when you think about

170
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,470
it looking at one of those things it's

171
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,300
like talking to the person who wrote it

172
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,450
that person's like telling you what the

173
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,040
good things are and there's a whole

174
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,800
bunch more like examples there's a whole

175
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,340
foxhole leveldb and streams community of

176
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:32,400
people making lists of modules and this

177
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,120
is where I write code yay okay so let's

178
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,280
actually get started and show what it

179
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,670
looks like nanas fun show what it looks

180
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:56,140
like to write code went up into shells

181
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,710
yeah sure what about looks like to write

182
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:04,830
code where'd these modules so go in here

183
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:14,190
will create a new little file yay so the

184
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,720
first thing i have here is I have a HTML

185
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,360
file for my little demo that just has

186
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,440
some CSS CSS is I don't want to talk

187
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,740
about how to- he says that's difficult

188
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,680
it has an bundle so has the bundle we're

189
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,760
going to load so we're going to have to

190
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,650
create a bundle and we'll start here but

191
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,010
building our thing so I want to go and

192
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,710
build a little piece of dom and i'm not

193
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,420
going to do it by hand so I'm going to

194
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,420
try and search for module that allows me

195
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,170
to create a new development and then

196
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,160
hopefully mpm comes back with useful

197
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,680
results

198
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,300
I and there's a motor called new element

199
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,260
list that hopefully does what i want so

200
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,500
i opened docs for it by using the MPN

201
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,140
ducks command and go off to the

202
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,140
browser's they create new elements put

203
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,890
some HTML in it and like templating

204
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,460
fantastic that's exactly what I wanted

205
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:31,090
so I want diff some texture net positive

206
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,780
6 20 just on so we just require the

207
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,810
motor top daddy looks great and then we

208
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,090
want to grab a container so again I

209
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,590
would search the stuff but I'm going to

210
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,820
skip a step because I'm p.m. search a

211
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,880
bit slow we're going to grab the

212
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:59,790
container by ID quit by 8d and then we

213
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,500
need to append stuff so grab a faint pen

214
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,750
stuff and will append box container and

215
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,550
the box and works just great so one of

216
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,450
the first things you might ask yourself

217
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,120
is ok cool I could have done mr. jquery

218
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,770
this is really not that hard if you use

219
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,270
larger libraries for example jquery here

220
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,110
you're going to be stuck with the

221
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,400
interface they have you're going to be

222
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,100
stuck with whatever design decisions

223
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,450
they've made an air interface and the

224
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,910
feature taste part of the box now

225
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,320
pending is trivial you don't want to

226
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,800
meet stuff for that by ID goes directly

227
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,790
to document element by ID which is

228
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,770
significantly faster than querying with

229
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,310
like a hash container and this new

230
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,930
element thing it kind of looks like how

231
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,050
you would build elements with jquery

232
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,160
except it has string interpolation built

233
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,620
into it and i don't know about you guys

234
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,240
but I don't like cat netting strings

235
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,650
manually when I can use string

236
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,770
interpolation so by picking these small

237
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,900
modules I have the freedom to use a

238
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,700
nicer API I have to freedom to like

239
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,760
say actually the API does other big

240
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,960
thing gave me the box is not good enough

241
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,120
I just want to go and like pick a

242
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,040
different one and if there's a bug in

243
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,200
this guy I'll just like throw it away

244
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,400
and use a different modules there's

245
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,890
another five to do exactly that so we'll

246
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:34,990
go here press a fight demo spin it 2 out

247
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:45,230
demos bundle and then open demos in the

248
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:50,600
spinner yep so that failed horribly

249
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,310
because reasons oh yeah I know I know

250
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,520
why I made the the text color white and

251
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,210
the CSS because so that's a great idea

252
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,290
white and white right let's finish

253
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,600
writing arrested coat here so this demo

254
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,990
is just going to be a little circle that

255
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,700
spins around so to do this animation i'm

256
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,750
going to use requestanimationframe loop

257
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,440
increment discounter render the box in

258
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,020
like the new location for the animation

259
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:34,010
and on loop again for loop again cool so

260
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,900
for a question emission frame obviously

261
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,480
there's a module for that there's a

262
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,370
motor for everything everything in my

263
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,590
purse we want unless is an example where

264
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,110
like if we had used jquery doesn't mean

265
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,640
how way of doing questioned emission

266
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,860
frame out of the box so you're going to

267
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,170
need to have either your own code or

268
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,620
module for that anyway and i'm too lazy

269
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,120
to write vendors so i'm going to copy

270
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,280
and paste it that i hear this one uses

271
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,230
yet another module for setting star

272
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,260
properties because i don't want to

273
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,650
remember differences between what the

274
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,660
dom does and what the h naught else gets

275
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,820
a bit well what the doanburs what c such

276
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,040
that Scott's opinions and now if we

277
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,010
bundles again go over here and refresh

278
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,329
this

279
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:22,740
clearly you've seen that I've hard-coded

280
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,589
you can't see anything clearly you've

281
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:30,149
seen that I've hard-coded the styling

282
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:33,060
for this thing to not fit more than 10

283
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,310
characters but other than that it looks

284
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:41,040
it looks great okay so that's kind of an

285
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,569
example of the workflow you go and

286
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,160
search what you want you pick the small

287
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,250
things you want it looks great now

288
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,990
however for me personally I don't want

289
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,759
to work that kind of granularity all the

290
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,519
time that granularity is fine if I want

291
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,130
to do anything performance insensitive

292
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:02,990
but I've had enough of touching the Dom

293
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,279
so let's step back a bit and talk about

294
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,420
some of the advantages to offering small

295
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,029
modules if you offer a small thing in

296
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:18,209
very hopefully people are going to be

297
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:19,800
able to reuse it and expand upon it and

298
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,529
collaborate with you I've actually ran

299
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:24,170
into multiple situations in the past

300
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,689
we've built like a medium sized thing

301
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,790
and I've tried to collaborate with

302
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,819
people and they said I things too big

303
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:35,519
and I want to touch it like I've

304
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,720
personally seen the the way to put it is

305
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,759
that people don't want to collaborate on

306
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,399
things that aren't justed absolute

307
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,720
minimum subset they want to collaborate

308
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,290
on they want to be able to it's a lot

309
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,329
easier to work with people if you if

310
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:02,339
your son opinions it's possible if

311
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,589
you're trying to write like one small

312
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,750
thing that does one thing well people

313
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,429
can work with you on that if you put

314
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:11,429
that thing into larger thing you're

315
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:12,750
going to start adding baggage you can

316
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,730
start adding opinion to it and people

317
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,659
don't want to work with you or not

318
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,929
anymore i wrote a motor collects it all

319
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,110
it's really boring since HTTP requests i

320
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,990
wrote it because I nine does cause

321
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,360
really terribly and I couldn't find

322
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,730
anything else I could do that now one of

323
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,080
the cool things about this is that other

324
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,070
people have built stuff on top of it

325
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,290
somebody built this library called HTTP

326
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:40,630
Phi and it basically takes Nicole's

327
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,880
requests on the server and access her on

328
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,100
the client and then gives it the same

329
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,750
interface so you can use the same code

330
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,600
in both sides he also added a couple of

331
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,360
features i forgot in exit are like form

332
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,560
encoding another guy builds a little

333
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,190
things of my thing for doing Jason by

334
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,470
default out of the box and also adding

335
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,610
promise support so my acute our modules

336
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,490
just driven by a normal call back

337
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,570
because it's driven by a normal call

338
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,890
back it's pretty easy to add from

339
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,620
support on top during inverse that's a

340
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,090
bit harder so like he is able to not

341
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,770
have to duplicate my coat just add

342
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,430
promises he can just add a thing on top

343
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,140
and obviously there's other like people

344
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,360
using your stuff if you write an

345
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:35,870
external module the internet sucks okay

346
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,290
someone's written in JavaScript client

347
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,770
for a flat sheet surface and rather than

348
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,020
using XML HP request directly use one of

349
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,660
our modules so the idea here is that if

350
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,970
you can write small things people can

351
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,130
use them to book collaborate on that and

352
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,800
people can build on top of it and as you

353
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,780
get more when people bodog on top of a

354
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,500
shared basis everybody wins like

355
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,030
it'sit's code reuse everybody

356
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:10,750
everybody's happy so the next concept

357
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,110
i'm going to talk about is building a

358
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,050
modular framework and when I say

359
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,600
framework here I want to like have a

360
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,310
quick aside on separating the

361
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,100
implantation of a front-end framework

362
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,890
from the concept the philosophy and the

363
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,520
ideologies a lot of those times those

364
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,920
two pieces are put together into one

365
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,030
package the most important thing about a

366
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,530
framework and the thing that's really

367
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,170
hard and you should avoid doing this at

368
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,610
all costs even though I'm doing it

369
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,710
myself and I'm at

370
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,240
person is to not write your own

371
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,130
philosophy to not write your own top

372
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,309
level concept of how to build

373
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:01,350
applications how to structure them

374
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:07,309
together and how to make them gel

375
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,010
however once you've taken some of these

376
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,570
concepts let's say I'd say for example

377
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,250
we take reacts flux concept or we take

378
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:23,850
Elms frp concept it is possible to have

379
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,450
multiple implementations of a concept so

380
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,600
we reacts flux it's all about having

381
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,500
unidirectional flow from a user input to

382
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,070
like managing a state to rendering

383
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,679
that's a great concept however it

384
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,149
shouldn't need to be coupled to any

385
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:45,059
imposition detail and people can differ

386
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,039
slightly on that choices implantation

387
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:53,100
for that so the advantage of differing

388
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,730
on the implantation is that everybody

389
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,539
can agree on like the top level concepts

390
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:01,860
and how to structure application how

391
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,720
things fit together but they can

392
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,429
disagree on whether they should use

393
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,649
premises or callbacks internally or they

394
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:10,860
can disagree on whether you should track

395
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,990
the things in an Opie fashion one FB

396
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,370
fashion like the the top level design

397
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:21,690
shouldn't be coupled to that so if you

398
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:27,419
want to build our own implantation of

399
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,179
one of these concepts ideally we can

400
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,620
take a whole bunch of modules together

401
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,880
and have them work well and once we do

402
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,700
that it means that the next guy that

403
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,230
comes along and has slightly different

404
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,779
ideas can go and we use half those

405
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:45,510
modules he doesn't have to go and be

406
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,120
right everything which seems to be

407
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,830
really common in the front end world

408
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,559
well javascript in general were terrible

409
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,909
at rewriting everything and I had this

410
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:57,799
personally

411
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,119
I try to use the subject of react myself

412
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,779
specifically that virtual domain

413
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,230
condition and I could not figure out

414
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,080
where it was in the imposition I spent a

415
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,669
lot of time looking back to source code

416
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:13,399
and I couldn't make head or day out of

417
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:17,659
it so I wish that would have been

418
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:19,159
written modular from the ground up I

419
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,499
wish react was already modular so I

420
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:24,019
didn't have to go and like I feel like a

421
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:25,460
terrible person every single time I

422
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:35,509
solve an already solved problem so going

423
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:37,789
back to this slide the biggest thing

424
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,690
about making sure that the tooling and

425
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,330
the framework uses modular is to

426
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,809
decompose your public space to decompose

427
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,999
what you want to build into reasonable

428
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:52,039
pieces I learn to work from the ground

429
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,470
up and the most important part actually

430
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,269
is to make sure every single piece you

431
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:00,440
write is useful ones own it has to like

432
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,379
actually be a thing or if you want to

433
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:07,159
use if you just take your big thing and

434
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:08,679
spread it out in the five smaller things

435
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,820
but each individual thing doesn't make

436
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,129
any sense at all without the others then

437
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,480
every other people can't use it it means

438
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,739
that people come build on top of it and

439
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:20,509
that's the thing we want we want people

440
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:23,239
to be able to build on top of each other

441
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:30,409
in to share code yeah so as an example

442
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,489
of how I went through and try to do this

443
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:37,220
approach myself I want to implement

444
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,940
something they had a unidirectional

445
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,950
paucity behind it I didn't invent the

446
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,519
supposed to be myself I didn't like come

447
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,789
to I didn't wake up one morning and

448
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:51,019
decided I this is how we're going to do

449
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:53,029
stuff I spent a lot of time reading

450
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:57,679
react ohm ohm literature about how does

451
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,259
approach should work and this is kind of

452
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:03,700
important like whenever you're going to

453
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,580
grab together modules ideally you want

454
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,740
to build on top of

455
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,190
what other people have done before now

456
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,800
this the part that sucks is I couldn't

457
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,740
find small mortgages that do what I

458
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,860
wanted and when I did find some i had to

459
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,750
reimplement them for really small in

460
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,130
petitioning tools which kind of sucked

461
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:36,020
but that's okay because I can use the

462
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,400
things i want to use and that people can

463
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,040
use the other ones it's it's okay to

464
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,630
have different implementations is the k2

465
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,580
have different trade-offs when I went

466
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,280
and decomposed my solution I wanted to

467
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,160
just build a representation of my state

468
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,850
where can be notified of changes and I

469
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,650
needed to be mutable for performance

470
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,610
reasons so I built a thing for being

471
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,770
notified of changes something as

472
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:09,170
observable and I'm built to amitabh an

473
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,840
immutable object in the mood for a

474
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,800
module and I had a strong focus on

475
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,559
making sure each one of these was useful

476
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,710
on zone and I separated them out to try

477
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,050
and reduce complexity apparently

478
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,000
influencing an immutable array is really

479
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,059
really hard I was really complex however

480
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:30,860
the other two were a lot simpler so I'm

481
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,309
happy with the outcome of isolating

482
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:37,460
complexity in like the complex module

483
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,110
and breaking out some simpler modules I

484
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,960
needed a way to represent input

485
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,220
thankfully I've written some modules a

486
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,620
year ago out of frustration with other

487
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,570
stuff I was doing and I could be used

488
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:56,710
half of them I wrote a module for

489
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,110
handling reading of user input out of

490
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,290
the Dom so whenever user interaction

491
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,570
happens I just want to be able to say

492
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,020
like when the submit action happens give

493
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,160
me all the state in this form and I

494
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,260
wrote this module so that would work

495
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,230
with the Dom interface edges returns you

496
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,179
know vent listener you can just element

497
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,639
add event listener

498
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:25,440
the thing and it works great standalone

499
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,829
and I'm really happy with being able to

500
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:31,649
build something that actually works

501
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:35,499
stand alone so in very other people can

502
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:39,549
go and use it we also had to implement

503
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:43,329
some stuff for the rendering side and I

504
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:45,159
really I tried really hard to use

505
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,450
reaction plantation but it was pretty

506
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,299
tightly coupled one of the things I

507
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:54,909
wanted with the rendering of my view was

508
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:59,109
to be able to say here's the stadium

509
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:01,389
application and here's what it should

510
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:04,659
look like so it's the exact same process

511
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:06,909
be behind reacts virtual Dom you just

512
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:09,940
want to say what it look like so I build

513
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,619
a motor for representing the virtual

514
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:14,109
tree I build a module for doing all the

515
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:16,479
Dom manipulation which is which was

516
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:19,119
paying yes and then I build a separate

517
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,179
one for just some syntax sugar because

518
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:23,469
creating a tree by hand without

519
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:26,469
something equivalent of jsx is a bit for

520
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:32,009
buzz now the interesting part here is

521
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:35,229
these pieces come together to build a

522
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:37,419
unidirectional stop application but

523
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:38,859
every single one of these pieces as an

524
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,109
invitation detail none of them are

525
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:45,940
actually important to be able to build

526
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,469
the application with the philosophy you

527
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:51,459
want with architecture you want which

528
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:53,499
means if you don't agree about imitation

529
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:56,200
details that's okay we can still agree

530
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,549
about the architecture we can still

531
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:00,269
agree about how you both applications

532
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:03,609
and you should build alternatives like

533
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:06,009
it's really healthy to have alternatives

534
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:09,729
if we don't have competition whenever

535
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,700
going to like built the best thing we

536
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,849
need competition for performance reasons

537
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:18,249
and so one of the things I mentioned

538
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:20,709
earlier was you could publish your I

539
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:24,549
components as modules and it's possible

540
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:30,700
to just zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom it's

541
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,459
possible to just publish some kind of

542
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:34,590
widgets

543
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,720
with Jim petition details of choice to

544
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,020
your package manager choice until use it

545
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,299
so this is going to render a little

546
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:49,440
widget document.body.appendchild and

547
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,029
it's going to show some his good name

548
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,890
there's somebody want to give me a name

549
00:28:52,890 --> 00:29:04,830
on github that jazz okay i will pick my

550
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,169
name because nobody shouted loud enough

551
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:10,529
so as an aside required business is

552
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:11,909
really cool tool for playing around with

553
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:15,500
NPM you can just write comment jess and

554
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,149
write mpm style stuff and you click we

555
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:22,200
build and it works so on the right you

556
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,330
can see the divine assets right we've

557
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,059
included some widget of the internet we

558
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,799
had the one line install we had the one

559
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,960
line require it comes with all the CSS

560
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,909
and the icons and the blah blah blah

561
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:36,299
blah blah blah blah the important thing

562
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:41,399
here is you can publish all of this to

563
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,789
NPM and we'll just work and also just

564
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:48,750
widget a temptation little users like my

565
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,899
framework and all of my all of the sub I

566
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:55,529
personally like and I export a dom based

567
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:57,770
interface so I people can use it and

568
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:04,799
that will work quite cleanly so the last

569
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,510
time I wanted to show was building one

570
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,700
of these unit or action elapsed with

571
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,940
modules and in fact the important part

572
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,110
of the demo wanted to show cuz I'm

573
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,159
really low on time was that whatever you

574
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,690
use as an imputation it'll so the

575
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,600
important thing about a unique direction

576
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,360
let's actually sure what it looks like

577
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:37,830
ratified demo to list ah happened in

578
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,120
next

579
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:57,270
I to do to do to do to do so I have a

580
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,780
little demo for a nap it's really stupid

581
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,400
you read some text and you had some

582
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,920
stuff and you had a feeling and it works

583
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,510
cool so the way represented this was I

584
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,150
wanted to say what user input is like

585
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,960
sad event I wanted to say what state was

586
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,010
which in this particular case is some

587
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,970
text up here and list of things and then

588
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,470
I wanted to handle user interaction all

589
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,140
in addition let's push a new thing into

590
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,250
the array and then rendering like I had

591
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,820
some rendering code which if you squint

592
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,490
really really hard it looks just like

593
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,850
Jade and you can pretend it's not that

594
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,190
you can pretend there's no braces it's

595
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,850
really not that bad render list which

596
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,429
one of the item we render thing and

597
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:55,140
reform over here ready not exciting but

598
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,720
the interesting thing here is if I don't

599
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,990
like the impression at all of what I

600
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,690
choose for the state I can just get rid

601
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,990
of it and i can swap out for a better

602
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,450
module it turns out there was a bug in

603
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,030
it or like I just don't like Venice and

604
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,850
it's code and I want to replace it back

605
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:23,150
on so you can implement a nap with the

606
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:28,290
same fossa fee and different different

607
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,280
modules so we want nope not that we want

608
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,790
okay I'm just going to cheat a bit more

609
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:41,640
we want this stuff

610
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,410
so here all I'm doing is I'm refactoring

611
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,360
my code to use backbone models and

612
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,360
backbone collections and I have another

613
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,850
model for the application state has the

614
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,710
exact same description and array of

615
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,720
events and I set it up over here and

616
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,440
then I'm not even gonna bother running

617
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,680
that one but I will run the other one

618
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:18,890
that and not work this will work now

619
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:26,960
let's open that so this one is the exact

620
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,610
same invitation exact same rendering

621
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,000
logic yeti-yeti-yeti-yeti and it's using

622
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,390
backbone at the model layer so one of

623
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,830
the kind of important parts of using

624
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,390
modules and the thing that we really

625
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,800
want to be able to swap out an entire

626
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,900
entire subsection of replication with

627
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,150
different in petition and this will be

628
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,850
really difficult to achieve if you using

629
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,210
some kind of tightly coupled MVC

630
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:01,130
framework and I believe that's all about

631
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:42,630
all I have time for thank you
