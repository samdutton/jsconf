1
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,369

2
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,540
builders holy Sh as love okay so how

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,259
many how many breakers okay now how many

4
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,739
people do its security of for a living

5
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,930
here is there any other security people

6
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,000
in the room yeah this is what it feels

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,220
like to be a tacit a developer

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,260
conference as a security person this is

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,430
really exciting so I'm going to talk

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:58,860
about it's broken I didn't do that

11
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,160
all right that was great unexpected so

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,740
I'm going to talk on builders versus

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,229
breakers if anyone is a scared of scared

14
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,780
of talking about feelings please leave

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,700
now it's a non-technical talk if you're

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,290
looking for live coding it's elsewhere

17
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,369
if you're looking for 0 days that's

18
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:16,690
elsewhere we're going to talk about

19
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,990
builders versus breakers hi everybody

20
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,259
I'm Adam you can find me on Twitter Adam

21
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:24,880
underscore Baldwin lift security node

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,790
security and github as evil packet I am

23
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,060
the CSO a chief security officer as well

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,920
as the chief of software operations for

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,759
and yet and I am the team lead at lift

26
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,420
security and yet sort of project so that

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,280
puts me a builder on one hand and braker

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,140
on the other and wedges me firmly in

29
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,750
between these these two communities and

30
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,640
it's the topic of builders versus

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,360
breakers has has tormented me for a

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,300
number of years in my career and I

33
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,709
didn't realize that first it sort of

34
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:17,010
snuck up on me and I I approached

35
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,120
approached things as a typical breaker

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
would I only looked at my perspective

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,170
early on in security i looked at in my

38
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,110
perspective of of how I thought of

39
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,280
security problems and how I approach

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,650
them and so what I'm going to talk about

41
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,660
today is basically all the things that I

42
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,220
screwed up as a breaker and try to give

43
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,430
the builders a perspective of that and

44
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,830
hopefully we'll come away from it

45
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,500
understanding a little bit more of both

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,650
the Builder perspective and the breaker

47
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,010
perspective and how we can both actually

48
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,250
work better together by understanding

49
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,340
each other a little bit more and again

50
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,230
through my failures and then through

51
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,730
some just ideas that I have so how many

52
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,329
of you have you've met a lot of a lot of

53
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:11,530
people at the conference right a lot of

54
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,700
new people is

55
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,330
anyone walked up to you and said hey uh

56
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,560
that shirt yeah that that not sure that

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,030
hat doesn't really work on you you

58
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,500
should you should you should wear it a

59
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,989
different hat it is better shape for

60
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,000
your head and for your face right nope

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,739
nobody walks up to you and introduces

62
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,230
themselves that way right thats thats

63
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,920
tends to be how security people do it

64
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,650
how breakers do it we this is how i met

65
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,170
adam brault the the founder of an yet

66
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,510
five years ago and this is when this is

67
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,049
when the start of my thinking about this

68
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:50,739
topic sort of started i sent him an

69
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,799
email and i said fix your capture so the

70
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,950
values and actually in the form it was

71
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,959
insecure put the site put it in the

72
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,610
session and check the post here's a

73
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,500
mutual friend of ours that's how i

74
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,130
introduce myself I you know in hindsight

75
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,590
that's that's pretty crass that's that's

76
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,329
not really a good way to start a

77
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:13,049
relationship with somebody it's like hey

78
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,269
your stuffs broken yeah do something

79
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,359
about it whatever I don't like here so

80
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,130
that was sort of the beginning of my

81
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,110
thinking on the subject introduced

82
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,280
myself and so that's one thing just kind

83
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,780
of keep this in mind as we as we go

84
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,289
along this is the start of that another

85
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,990
project that I worked on was evil packet

86
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,870
net and I thought I was reporting these

87
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,210
web vulnerabilities to to builders to

88
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,080
developers to projects and you know I

89
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,810
was getting like nobody cared nobody's

90
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,810
responded respond might fix it and I

91
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,680
thought maybe maybe that understanding

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,240
was founded in not or that

93
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,690
misunderstanding was was founded in they

94
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,250
didn't understand the impact developers

95
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,169
didn't understand the impact of what

96
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,050
those vulnerabilities what could cause

97
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,289
right and turns out that's that's that's

98
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:11,800
wrong and it's sort of like end up being

99
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,139
so when I look back on it it was

100
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,000
effective in getting things fixed and

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,360
sir sure some people did learn some

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,919
things about vulnerabilities and

103
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,960
exploits and whatever

104
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,539
but it was a very negative way to do it

105
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,310
and I'm going to talk specifically about

106
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,460
some of those in a minute just kind of

107
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,949
keep keep these in mind as we as we go

108
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:40,960
Ryan are you here running your all right

109
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,300
so this one's this one's for you back in

110
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,160
in as a as a breaker I thought it was a

111
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,430
great idea to start going to developer

112
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,789
conferences you guys see I said it right

113
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:59,139
there Builders are my audience right

114
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,910
from a security perspective I want to

115
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:05,229
talk to you it's really hard for me not

116
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,539
say to you guys and separate myself so

117
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:12,669
at JS conf in Portland Ryan gave me the

118
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,169
feedback during my talk I kept saying

119
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,440
you guys this you guys that point point

120
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,070
point you know rant rant rant typical

121
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,449
breaker mindset and yeah I was giving

122
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,150
very direct feedback like you know I

123
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,289
don't remember the exact sweet i

124
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,900
couldn't find it but it was something

125
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,699
you know something of the you know this

126
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,710
guy's saying you guys like a lot like

127
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,099
stop and its really really really

128
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,009
impacted my thing like those two words

129
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,840
and that feedback I don't think you

130
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,789
realize how just how much it's had an

131
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:49,870
impact on my on my thinking about the

132
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,310
interaction between the two communities

133
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,969
and when you're speaking if you as a

134
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,770
builder the developer if you're going to

135
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,009
go speak at a security event remember be

136
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:01,539
a part of that community because because

137
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:04,150
you are we really are we really have a

138
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,759
limit like relationship that that is

139
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,039
very dependent on each other don't

140
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,289
alienate yourself like I did like don't

141
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,840
it was just I missed a huge opportunity

142
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,340
to connect with people and get my

143
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,949
message across because I just put up

144
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,469
that wall I'm an outsider looking in I'm

145
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:21,969
not you know I'm just saying blah blah

146
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:26,650
rant so again keep that in mind and

147
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,610
thank you so it's still a little bit of

148
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,289
a story about a specific organization

149
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:38,050
that will kind of demonstrate some of

150
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,460
the things that I'm talking about

151
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,410
basecamp classic 37signals was the I

152
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,540
found a vulnerability in base camp in

153
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,370
which you could take over any account

154
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,700
this is a few years back and I let

155
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,950
37signals know it's actually the second

156
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,370
video i published an evil packet and

157
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,880
during that process i contacted support

158
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,300
and I wrote him a nice email I don't I

159
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,120
try to look at if I didn't have it and I

160
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,220
basically said here's the problem I got

161
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,390
a response back from the support and

162
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,410
said basically you know our clients like

163
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,460
to be able to do this like to be put

164
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,230
javascript in the pages and whatever and

165
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,870
basically what they said is that it's a

166
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,450
feature and this is was my answer

167
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,560
cross-site scripting is not a feature

168
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,650
and i made a video about it and put it

169
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,230
on the internet and they got raked over

170
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:35,620
the coals in hindsight feeling wise i

171
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,810
felt a terrible for what what was being

172
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,740
what what was going on there but we'll

173
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,390
get to it now feelings so let's let's

174
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,810
talk about what's happening during both

175
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,080
on both sides when when these things are

176
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,130
reported so you know imagine yourself as

177
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,950
as the developer as the builder in this

178
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,710
scenario I want you to really think hard

179
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:13,250
about how you would feel as the breaker

180
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,840
this is how I feel i get an enormous

181
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,490
adrenaline high from finding soft you

182
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,850
know security bugs in your software i

183
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,910
love it i get so i do this thing at work

184
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,260
like i skipped down the hall and i like

185
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,850
like do a jig and and as the co-workers

186
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,860
going to test i skip and holler and jump

187
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,220
and get excited and I'm happy I'm happy

188
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,340
to find a flaw and what you did and

189
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,450
that's most security people they get

190
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,790
really excited they're like they just

191
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,750
get just pumped up what happens on the

192
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,020
other side when I tell

193
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,740
the developer about that flaw what

194
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,770
happens is they feel right you get the

195
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,370
you get the exact opposite reaction and

196
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,770
this this realization that I've had that

197
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,460
that it is actually it's causing anxiety

198
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,330
if you don't know how to handle the

199
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,260
problem you have immediate anxiety about

200
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,440
how do I address this problem you might

201
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,420
be pissed off that I pointed out your

202
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,730
flaw who wants once their stuff paraded

203
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,470
around the internet that they had this

204
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,820
flaw right you're pointing out mistakes

205
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,490
or the breakers pointing out mistakes

206
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,340
the Builder has made its it's not a nice

207
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,920
thing to have somebody to say hey your

208
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,670
stuffs broken and as a security person

209
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,040
we don't have a lot of vested interest

210
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,090
we we we basically don't empathize with

211
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,410
your position we into traditionally we

212
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,690
think of hey this is the most important

213
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,730
thing in the world we found this

214
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,830
vulnerability this is the thing the

215
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,960
security you should take and fix it

216
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,020
right now because I'm excited about it

217
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,810
but you're not you it's the complete

218
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,100
opposite plus you have things like I

219
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,800
don't know conferences to do it

220
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,900
conferences to go to and I don't know

221
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,680
bugs to fix and other things to do

222
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,690
besides fix my thing which to me is the

223
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,370
most important thing in the world to you

224
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:30,060
it might just be a very small thing so

225
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,480
instead we can kind of look at it this

226
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,310
way and my son said there needed to be

227
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,920
flags on the castle so on the on the

228
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,520
plane he drew flags on it so imagine

229
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,140
this one instead that that extreme

230
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,470
extreme highs like instead looks like a

231
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,500
wave and and really what a breakers

232
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,860
bringing to you sort of depending on how

233
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,240
they bring it to you there they're going

234
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,550
to say here's this problem really

235
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,250
they're saying there's a wave coming

236
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,770
there's something coming and it's gonna

237
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,030
hey you got your sand castle you might

238
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,290
want to you might want to do something

239
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,059
to your castle to protect it

240
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,969
move in and if you're prepared for that

241
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:11,629
communication and you understand you

242
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,219
understand that their intention is not

243
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:16,699
to knock your sandcastle over but to

244
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:17,929
actually warned you about something

245
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:19,519
coming towards your stank ass what's the

246
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,109
beach I to make sand castle analogy it

247
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:24,859
is if you understand that that's their

248
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:28,909
intention it's going to reduce that

249
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:31,129
negative aspect that negative feeling

250
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:34,099
that you have when that when you get

251
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:35,929
when you have that thing that problem

252
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,519
reported to you when you when you have

253
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,039
that when you have that experience it

254
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,809
actually becomes a more becomes a more

255
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:47,239
positive experience so how can we work

256
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:49,419
better together and I love this because

257
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:52,819
you know we're builders and breakers can

258
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,459
work together and should we rely very

259
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:59,029
heavily on each other breakers if if you

260
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:03,979
get I said it again if it's really hard

261
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:09,739
I if if builders don't build anything I

262
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:14,109
don't have anything to do as a breaker

263
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:19,519
and so so we need you we need we need

264
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,149
builders and builders need the feedback

265
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:24,169
of breakers because they think

266
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:26,359
differently they they have that

267
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:28,429
different opinion that different

268
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:32,419
different perspective so what's what's

269
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,219
the biggest thing here communication

270
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:37,129
right it's it's it's really all about

271
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,329
communication between the builders of

272
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:41,119
the breakers my coworker stephanie meyer

273
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:44,709
i wrote this this morning got published

274
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,119
about listening this this applies to

275
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:50,719
both sides when we listen really listen

276
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:55,399
we reveal respect support understanding

277
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,219
and empathy we also possess the power to

278
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:04,339
impart a renewed confidence clarity and

279
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:07,749
a sense that everything is going to be

280
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:13,530
okay when we listen well

281
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,730
so let's give some thoughts on how we

282
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,930
can listen better and how we can

283
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,300
communicate better let's go back to the

284
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,750
base camp a classic story because that's

285
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,340
not the end they didn't just get raked

286
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,750
over the coals and everything okay

287
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,630
that's where it stopped what happened

288
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,850
was is they they responded by

289
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,040
understanding that this was going to

290
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,560
happen again that they were going to

291
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,880
have somebody else report something them

292
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,760
they were going to have to deal with

293
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,790
breakers and so they built a Security

294
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,850
Response process they've made a page

295
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,410
that said we appreciate your concern we

296
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,170
appreciate the breakers they're trying

297
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,880
to understand the breaker perspective

298
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,890
and understand that that what we're

299
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,800
offering to them is of some value to me

300
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,390
that that makes me actually that makes

301
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,060
me actually that feels good makes it

302
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,040
feel valuable for for what I'm providing

303
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,810
and makes me want to go a little bit

304
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,220
more of an effort put it more effort in

305
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,230
they they said here's how here's here's

306
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,590
expectations for tracking disclosure and

307
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,800
security issues right here's here's what

308
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,210
you can expect for communication such

309
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,400
and thanks for working with us and we're

310
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,720
going to put your name on this list so

311
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,660
you get some you get some credit out of

312
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,490
it because that's the motivation of a

313
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,160
lot of breakers right the people getting

314
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,710
paid to do a lot of consulting work

315
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,720
don't have time to work on random stuff

316
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,500
and just throw stuff out there the ones

317
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,570
that are have the time to do that are

318
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,860
the ones trying to make a name for

319
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,220
themselves they're working on they're

320
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,110
working on it for the ego for the credit

321
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,430
so they can build their resume and they

322
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,990
can build their skills in the security

323
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,610
community and whether it's right or

324
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,680
wrong they're going to play with your

325
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,370
apps that's what they're going to do so

326
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,810
they give them some credit because it

327
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,190
gives them it gives them something to

328
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,780
hold onto and feel good about so it's a

329
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,960
developer what you know what can I do is

330
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,950
the developer for projects you can we've

331
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,540
got contributor at MD we got to read me

332
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,270
right wine out of security at MD want to

333
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,700
add to your projects how you want issues

334
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,930
reported to you

335
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,589
because unfortunately based on the

336
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:31,820
relationship of the builder in the

337
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,649
breaker and the responsibility for the

338
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,390
project you have a lot of the

339
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,770
communication onus on yourself as a

340
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,870
builder you have we have way more

341
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,940
responsibility and you're gonna get

342
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,380
these things logged over and you don't

343
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,520
know how they're going to come in so try

344
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,820
to try to put it out there and how you

345
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,890
want these reported to you what are some

346
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,839
of the expectations that this personal

347
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,660
receiving your respond 24 hours just

348
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,860
doesn't have to be detailed or complex

349
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,470
and put a list of humans or put you know

350
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,770
people that have contributed thoughts

351
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,990
bugs security bugs whatever give them

352
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,179
some credit we know a lot of open source

353
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:09,920
projects can't you can't give them cash

354
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,600
gets not a big bounty program right

355
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,120
maybe some swag or you know I mentioned

356
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,949
is that's great for they're there for

357
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,530
what they're looking for if you want a

358
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,319
good example this look at the amber

359
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,390
security policy and how they do things

360
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,700
it's bit so it's a great baseline for

361
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,700
for what you could include it's pretty

362
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,250
detailed and it goes it's based on a lot

363
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,559
of security community research and

364
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,110
things like that go check it out one

365
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,850
other thing you can do is self disclose

366
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,730
your vulnerabilities who wants to do

367
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,980
that that's that's a hard thing to do

368
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,809
it's a hard thing for us to as

369
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:50,510
developers to just put our flaws out

370
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,800
there instead of just patching it a

371
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,630
little commute message throwing in the

372
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,670
repo and I'm going to talk about a

373
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,500
project here a little bit that I'd like

374
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,260
if you're writing no taps I love you to

375
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,059
disclose too because we got a really

376
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:05,240
interesting project going on and

377
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,160
actually handling a security failure so

378
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,100
you know a problem properly and publicly

379
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,120
can build trust there's a great example

380
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,420
from a client of mine github and they do

381
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,950
a great job of handling these things

382
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,190
whenever they have a problem right they

383
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,460
disclose a ton of detail they write a

384
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,200
blog post about here's what happened

385
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,880
here's what we're going to do about it

386
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,890
here's the technical bits and we all

387
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,240
learn from it and they do this because

388
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,340
they realize they're in the they're in a

389
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,690
position of technical leadership in the

390
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,690
community and

391
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,799
chances are so are many of you in your

392
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,580
different areas as a builder so you can

393
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:53,649
lead in the same example in the same way

394
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:55,889
so now I'm going to talk about a project

395
00:18:55,889 --> 00:19:00,509
that I started based on what I've been

396
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,620
learning over sort of the past five

397
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,019
years of these and as one thing that I

398
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,360
hadn't mentioned yet is that all of

399
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,580
those all those things those failures of

400
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,799
mine and the closest that I've been to

401
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,509
and yet and a lot of other development

402
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:16,679
teams have got me to really empathize

403
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,250
with builders and the feelings that you

404
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,029
go through when when you have something

405
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,190
reported to you it's really really hard

406
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,669
for me now to note to have to have these

407
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,789
feelings in empathy to drop a note a

408
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:35,490
about a product I feel like a complete

409
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,340
asshole if I did that right I would just

410
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,820
feel I'd feel horrible and it doesn't

411
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,289
help anything it's a very negative thing

412
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,299
to do there's a there's an interesting

413
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,009
example out there right now a PayPal

414
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,450
PayPal has got a bug bounty program

415
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,519
there's a 17 year old that tried to

416
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,809
disclose a bug to them and he's not old

417
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:56,789
enough to get a bounty so he just

418
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,289
dropped and he just dropped it on full

419
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,519
disclosure and so don't hear you

420
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,259
actually made it worse by not really

421
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,350
trying to work through the problem with

422
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,480
their just like whatever it's just

423
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,759
simple now we got the information just

424
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,740
go away they actually actually turned

425
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,279
into a lot much larger wave and then

426
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,000
using it as a sort of early warning so

427
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,870
now that I've covered all the stuff that

428
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,759
I forgot to talk about earlier let's

429
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,230
talk about the node security project

430
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,269
who's here has heard about the note

431
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:28,889
security project Wow awesome so the note

432
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:31,019
security project is something that uh as

433
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:37,409
I as as as a CSO and and yet my job is

434
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:40,320
to care about building secure software

435
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,259
and I started by trying to figure out

436
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:46,169
how how are people going to try to break

437
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:49,110
our product and bang how how are we

438
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,509
going to find who's going to report

439
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:52,590
flaws in it and how

440
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,630
how can we attack it what I came down to

441
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,539
was well there's NPM thing we're

442
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,880
trusting a lot of modules we're trusting

443
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,820
a lot of third-party code and so we

444
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,500
started sort of looking into problems

445
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,720
well we you know we we had one thing

446
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,890
where you know the password hashes were

447
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,320
disclosed from NPM right people might

448
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,850
have heard of that and had to change

449
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,470
your password on NPM so all those were

450
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,779
disclosed we had a cross-site request

451
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,929
forgery protection to the the NPM site

452
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,450
I've had a lot of discussion with Isaac

453
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,960
you know about the security of NPM and

454
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,120
so there's been a lot of conversations

455
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,799
between builder and braker community

456
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,539
there that that led up to this

457
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,370
particular project in some of the things

458
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,020
that the security of NPM so I thought

459
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,870
what's the next layer well what's the

460
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,490
next node security projects is we need

461
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,830
to check out the security of the modules

462
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,330
the things that we trust right the

463
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,820
things that all of the builders doing

464
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,140
node projects trust so it's an

465
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,020
experiment to bridge the security

466
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,440
community with the Builder community

467
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,299
we're taking both of these communities

468
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:01,950
and mashing them together and trying to

469
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,000
get them to play nice and I really

470
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,220
really really was nervous about how we

471
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,750
were going to have these researches and

472
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,590
how are you going to handle the

473
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,090
organization it turns out it's not very

474
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,860
hard the ones that have come on board

475
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,620
are really really excited to work with

476
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,260
builders and they understand that we

477
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,720
don't have to be you know gasps holes to

478
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,390
get to make change and have have good

479
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,610
progress here's some major contributors

480
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,730
to date Adam Brault from our team Nathan

481
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,309
lafreniere bear Michael Rogers mr.

482
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,130
Daniel Shaw Neil pool is a security

483
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,370
researcher Luka Cara Tony Stephen dravis

484
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,679
was a node developer he's building he's

485
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,870
helping us build tools he doesn't really

486
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,720
know anything about security but we rely

487
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,450
so heavily on on builders that can help

488
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,690
us build tools that are mindsets we're

489
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,549
not that's not that's not what we do so

490
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:56,100
we have to like static analysis and

491
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,179
things like that to do it really

492
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,789
efficiently and well we're relying on

493
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,530
our workflow we're relying on builders

494
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,559
to help us our low brow and Jacopo

495
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,920
Tarantino again another

496
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,420
another builder it's helping us build

497
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,550
our portal to disclose advisories and

498
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,860
things like that our workflow so what

499
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,420
are our goals we're going to audit every

500
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,090
module which is pretty much absolutely a

501
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,690
crazy thing Isaac said it's a massive

502
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,960
ambitious potentially ocean boiling

503
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,210
undertaking and it is we've figured out

504
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,790
a way to do it efficiently and if you

505
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,960
want to know some of the technical bits

506
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,800
and go into that sort of after but we're

507
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,230
going to audit you know say 31,000 if

508
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,810
that numbers gone up since I fixed this

509
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,680
last night and then we're going to fix

510
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,550
the broken modules but traditional

511
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,730
security projects just go your things

512
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,190
broken your things broken go fix it

513
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,560
we're going to report the issues we find

514
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,050
is as best we can we're going to try to

515
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,390
do it privately can't do that try to get

516
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,030
ahold of with a maintainer we can't do

517
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,030
that we'll end up putting an issue in in

518
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:10,540
the repository stop texting me and we're

519
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,550
going to try to do it in a very polite

520
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,320
and positive way we're trying not to be

521
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,810
like all the history of that we're

522
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,070
trying to break out of that mold and

523
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,170
we're going to send pull requests we're

524
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,730
not going to publish an advisory without

525
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,560
something fixed if a module is two years

526
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,660
old we find a vulnerability in the

527
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,810
maintainer doesn't want to do it and or

528
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,780
got it you know doesn't exist anymore or

529
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,220
whatever we're going to supply a patch

530
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,190
pull requests

531
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:50,279
all right actually that's that's the

532
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,779
difference we're trying to cross that

533
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:55,649
line and fix stuff instead of just cause

534
00:24:55,649 --> 00:25:00,230
problems so here's an example that of

535
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,500
communication on Hugh bot github so

536
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,570
their client we tried to report it

537
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,090
internally they said go ahead and go

538
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,860
ahead and put it in the repo and the

539
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,269
maintainer will take care of it we

540
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:16,080
published it and at midnight-ish the

541
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,259
issues is closed silently so we put this

542
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,029
vulnerability in there if she was closed

543
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:22,980
silently no comment one of our

544
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,110
researchers said I think you may have

545
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,669
closed the wrong issue it's small sorry

546
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:29,460
the code for email that coffee is still

547
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,370
vulnerable not taking an attacking tone

548
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,179
thinking maybe there was a mistake

549
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:37,470
making sure that we communicate not just

550
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,000
say well alright we're just good publish

551
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,950
an advisory whatever and be done with it

552
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,149
no so tom says I closed the correct

553
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:46,470
issue he bought have run a trusted

554
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,090
environment if you don't trust people

555
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,190
you allow access to you but I think you

556
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,049
should stop at you know allowing them

557
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:55,049
access to Hugh but we didn't particular

558
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:57,330
agree with that but again we didn't we

559
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,909
didn't take an attacking tone Neil Neil

560
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:01,440
did a great job of communicating this

561
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,389
since it's a great example what we're

562
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:06,299
trying to do I appreciate that he

563
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,009
acknowledges because it's true if you

564
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:09,690
have trusted people sure he says I

565
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,309
appreciate that but Hugh bought as open

566
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:12,690
source there's no guarantee at Hugh bot

567
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,659
will be running a trusted environment

568
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:17,190
and also even if you even if that

569
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,570
guarantee did exist just because you

570
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,710
give somebody access to Hugh buy it

571
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,750
doesn't mean you want them running

572
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,450
arbitrary code in this case on your

573
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,389
server right at the end instead of

574
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:28,889
arguing because we could just continue

575
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:31,620
to banter back and forth this fixed

576
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,330
should be really fairly straightforward

577
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,740
would you be willing to consider merging

578
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,320
a pull request I think the next day he

579
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,139
just we whipped up a patch Senate merged

580
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:43,679
done didn't have to argue didn't have to

581
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,289
fight over at de neve just done so it

582
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,419
was fantastic and then we're going to

583
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,220
publish the results we're not publishing

584
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,320
anything that does not have a fix for it

585
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,700
so we're going to try really really hard

586
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,690
to have

587
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,669
pull requests have those patches here's

588
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:01,799
an example of just a few that we found

589
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,240
already that have gone through the

590
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,139
pipeline how you can contribute is is

591
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:12,299
basically all detail that note security

592
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,210
I oh I need people to do patches there's

593
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,889
there's issues we have mark there it

594
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:19,799
says need patch and I don't necessarily

595
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,509
I'm not the best person to write those

596
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:24,659
so I need help in that area and it's

597
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:25,769
something that somewhere you could

598
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,269
contribute usually they're just quick

599
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:29,159
little one offs that probably takes

600
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,200
somebody that's a good good builder

601
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,990
15-20 minutes maybe you know less it

602
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,000
take me you know okay I got to figure

603
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,690
out how to write JavaScript again today

604
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:46,980
yeah quick recap so each we have we have

605
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,460
a relationship builders and breakers

606
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,600
that rely upon each other we all have

607
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,220
and need to respect and understand the

608
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,529
feelings of the other of the other party

609
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:00,360
and realize that that we both do have

610
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,169
good intention we have to communicate

611
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:07,830
and listen effectively try to be nice

612
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,720
and positive about it this this we can

613
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,059
break out of that mold we can do things

614
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:15,299
differently some we have an amazing

615
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:20,700
community and it's ok it's ok it's ok to

616
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,259
screw up like there's going to be

617
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:23,340
researchers that you're going to be

618
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,539
jerks to you and there's going to be

619
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,909
builders that don't listen to two

620
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:29,789
researchers and breakers and we just

621
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:31,500
have to fight through that and remind

622
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,539
those parties that that hey here's how

623
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:37,980
we could work through this and don't

624
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,269
don't immediately take the attacking

625
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:43,740
tone don't immediately dismiss something

626
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,360
that a breaker says we have good

627
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,470
intentions both sides and if you want

628
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,539
more information want to chat about it

629
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,879
I'll be available later i also have note

630
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:55,320
security stickers because when you put a

631
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,120
lock on something it's more secure right
