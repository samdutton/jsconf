1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,889
Wow.

2
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:12,880
We are in the land of the JavaScripters.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,680
But you already knew that.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:24,660
So, today, I'm going to share some thoughts
in a medium that you probably weren't expecting.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:34,620
I know I'm not the first person to bring poetry
to a tech conference, and I sincerely hope

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,399
I'm not the last.

7
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:46,290
You see, JavaScript, and the people who write
JavaScript - that's you all - have been essential

8
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,420
to my work in developer relations.

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:59,640
I've watched the culture and the language
evolve and grow up over the past decade.

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,660
This is the tweet that went out announcing
my talk.

11
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:11,749
I was so excited and so honoured, I decided
to embrace it, even though I have never, ever

12
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:16,079
thought of myself as a golden girl.

13
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,830
I had to wonder: what would you all be expecting
from me?

14
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:30,149
So I struggled for weeks trying to find a
way into my story, and then one random Wednesday

15
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:37,659
morning in April, after several weeks of waking
up in the middle of the night in the dark,

16
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:44,229
in a cold panic, I decided to get up and write.

17
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,990
I began.

18
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,950
Why is my brain so unsharp?

19
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,049
This might be my last conference talk ever!

20
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:03,149
Then I kept going as the light crawled into
the garden, and the birds started making noise,

21
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:10,489
I wrote, ""The JS Confs were punk rock, they
cut the crap and went roller blading.""

22
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:14,349
Then I stepped slowly away from the display.

23
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:22,170
I grabbed a pad, a lined legal pad, and a
pen, and started writing.

24
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:30,470
14 lines later, it was a Sonnet, strict rhyme
scheme, a meter called iambic pentameter that

25
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:39,080
sounds like the beat of your heart.

26
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,110
I felt lighter than I had in weeks.

27
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:52,080
Writing poetry had put me into a fine state
of flow.

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,560
This is the first one, the beginning.

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:07,440
Here goes: when I consider JSConf EU and wonder
what it is I have to share, heroic JavaScripters

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,450
I once knew, or why UI or Ajax, or would you
even care?

31
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,120
I've studied coders long, but not the code.

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,370
I know constraint can free up self-expression.

33
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:34,560
Rhyme, scheme, metre, platform, network, Node,
but is there room on stage for true confession?

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:44,660
You see, I will speak of culture's evolution,
but you are the artisan of JS give and taking,

35
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:54,680
and I'm not here to 'splain your revolution,
it's iterative and comes from daily making,

36
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:06,430
creating more than apps and interactions,
you terraform immersive new distractions.

37
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,560
You're going to see this slide at the close
of every sonnet.

38
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,520
I will read nine of them, or eight more of
them today.

39
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:25,080
It's a visualisation of Lorenz's strange contractor,
a simplified model that describes con convex

40
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:37,090
know in the world's atmosphere, the unverified
idea of the butterfly effect that small changes

41
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:46,090
of state like a butterfly flapping her wings
can influence larger, more significant difference

42
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:53,150
s later and elsewhere, like triggering a Tornado
thousands of miles away.

43
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,449
We will get back to that a little bit later
in the talk.

44
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:05,639
For now, it turns out the constraints of poetry
are not totally different from the constraints

45
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,240
of code.

46
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:15,639
In producing things of craft, and artfulness,
in a sonnet, as in code, you have to pack

47
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:23,330
a lot of meaning and intent into tightly controlled
syntax and word choices.

48
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:29,990
And then there are elegant ways to go bonkers
and bend or break the rules.

49
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:36,350
Quick two-minute history of the sonnet form:
it was created in Italy in the early 13th

50
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:45,050
century, the poet Petrarch was its most famous
practitioner.

51
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:52,110
The form travelled across Europe and arrived
in England in the early 16th century, just

52
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:59,340
in time for the Liz - Elizabethan poets and
Shakespeare most famously of all who wrote

53
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,759
164 sonnets.

54
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:10,960
Through the centuries, poets everywhere wrote
sonnets in their own languages.

55
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:23,279
In Russia, in the early 1800s, Alexander Pushkin
wrote a novel in verse called Eugene Onegin,

56
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,729
about the life and times of a young romantic,
let's say.

57
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:39,150
In 1922, in German, in a chilly castle in
Switzerland, the Austrian poet Rheiner wrote

58
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:45,050
a 55-sonnet cycle called Sonnets to Orpheus.

59
00:06:45,050 --> 00:07:01,180
In 1986, inspired by Pushkin, Indian-born
author Vikram Seth wrote Golden Gate.

60
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,900
He inspired me, and so it goes.

61
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:15,150
The sonnet endures as a poetic form for story-telling,
philosophying, celebrations of love and festive

62
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,580
occasions.

63
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:33,620
The second sonnet, the origin story, was inspired
by a talk from Jan Lenhardt written in 2015.

64
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:41,059
The times have changed with JavaScript's ascent.

65
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,930
Since Voodoo Tik.

66
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:53,339
God pitched us to sponsor a new event, a gathering
in Washington beyond the web 2.0 of suits

67
00:07:53,339 --> 00:08:03,199
and swag, and paid product pitches, the first
JSConf happened in the spring, and almost

68
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,630
didn't due to funding givens.

69
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,630
But tickets sold.

70
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:18,960
It was a homecoming for folks who didn't know
that content plus fun could raise up a community

71
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,119
of like-minded coders where once was none.

72
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:31,550
It was not long to find an opportunity to
do another one in pulsing Berlin.

73
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:48,070
Jan, Malte, Kristina made the JSConfs and
considers considers Confs pure win.

74
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,750
In the sonnets ahead, I will continue to poke
at the relationship between the writer's craft

75
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,640
and the coder's.

76
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,910
In Elizabethan England, poets would release
their sonnets in private to an elite audience

77
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,990
before sharing them more widely, kind of like
I'm doing here today.

78
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,600
So, please be kind to these little songs of
mine.

79
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,520
Like me, they're travellers from an older
world.

80
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:26,680
Into JavaScript World Domination of course.

81
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,940
Trajectory is best viewed in retrospect.

82
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,890
A JS singularity was never inevitable.

83
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:45,650
But loose federation makes network effect,
and the JSConfs have been unforgettable.

84
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:55,000
Client side, server side, dark side of the
moon, Asia, Australia, Colombia, Budapest.

85
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,120
No JS and Tito launched from this cocoon,
Iceland, Scotland, CSSConfs and the rest.

86
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:13,070
It's that magic dynamic that comes to your
town, building cam lad which out of the fun.

87
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,810
Maybe it is conferences all the way down.

88
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:23,550
Artefacts of knowledge, with access for everyone.

89
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:38,020
And always new ideas are put in play, to globally
influence a generation's way.

90
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:44,780
One of those good ideas that did not emerge
immediately was the need for a code of conduct.

91
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,000
And a focused committed effort to enforce
it.

92
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,060
A along with a commitment to foster a diverse,
and inclusive environment for all attendees

93
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:04,870
and all speakers, we can and we must keep
doing better at this, and maybe this weekend,

94
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,180
I think this weekend has shown me some of
what's possible.

95
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:20,970
So, the code of conduct: at our events, we
do not tolerate harassment of participants

96
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,140
in any form.

97
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,970
A posted code of conduct works to mitigate.

98
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,210
In 2011, this was far from the norm.

99
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:42,280
Today, we raise each other up through schooling
for unbiased language and communication.

100
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:51,790
Appropriate kindness and respect, and tooling
to promote good behaviour and collaboration.

101
00:11:51,790 --> 00:12:01,260
We will not tolerate at our events stalking
or following, or unwelcome comments.

102
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:09,250
This unwelcome contact, this includes offensive
verbal comments.

103
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:18,690
You see a code of conduct is a pact, reminding
each of us of our humanity, and hoping tolerance

104
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,330
can replace profanity.

105
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:29,170
Okay, in sonnet 5, I look back in time.

106
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:35,800
Emma Lazarus was a writer and activist in
New York City, well educated, and well to

107
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,220
do.

108
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,911
In 1883, she wrote the sonnet that eventually
found the plaque on the pedestal in the on

109
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:51,290
the Statue of Liberty in New York City Harbor.

110
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:58,850
Those are the words of welcome for immigrants
and refugees to the United States.

111
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:09,530
A digital immigrant, that's me, reflects on
em-La Lazarus: the sonnet is a poem of 14

112
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:15,950
lines, give me your tired, your poor, your
huddled masses.

113
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:29,160
Octave sestet define the sonnet of Shakespeare,
Petrach that made the Statue of Liberty ever

114
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:39,310
more a mother of exiles, for every refugee,
her lift ed lamp beside the golden door gives

115
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,450
worldwide welcome to the land of the free.

116
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:57,020
20 years to go from print to monument, written
in 1883, engraved on a plaque in 1903, a poem

117
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,810
for the immigrant, by an author and an activist.

118
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,150
A world-class harbour hack.

119
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:14,470
Emma, like me, a New York City girl with Jewish
roots, wielding words to change minds, our

120
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,960
work in cahoots.

121
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,140
T pause.

122
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,600
This next poem was inspired by a Ted talk
by Carole Cadwalladr whose role as a journalist

123
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:38,860
uncovered the work of Cambridge Analytica
in affecting the Brexit vote.

124
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:52,540
I will quote Zeldman where nothing fails like
success, about the dangers of surveillance

125
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:59,100
as a business model.

126
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:07,970
The immigrant who puts down roots but never
learns the language, that's JavaScript and

127
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,300
me.

128
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,720
Sometimes, code is export that changes lives
forever.

129
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,360
Though nothing fails like success to keep
us free.

130
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:27,500
Gathering wise words from Twitter, I could
read, I could Weave sonnets of bravery in

131
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:34,890
140 characters, gleaned from conferences recorded
to retrieve later, to remember the passion

132
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,150
of others.

133
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:45,990
Courage in the form of a Ted talk by Carole
Cadwalladr, to Silicon Valley, sheer terror

134
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,350
didn't stop her speaking truth to power.

135
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,900
Her urgency to save democracy.

136
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,840
Will we play with our phones as this darkness
falls?

137
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:10,870
Fascism rises when democracy palls.

138
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:17,500
I would not be here today if it weren't for
my employer, Mozilla, and I'm Not Really Sure

139
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:29,660
That the Web is It is It We Know It Were It
Not for Mozilla, So This is a Sonnet for Mozilla.

140
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:37,170
You may know Mozilla as the dinosaur that
birthed a browser open source out of Netscape's

141
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,220
ashes.

142
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:48,090
Long my Firefox endure as a user-centric client,
with a mission worth your love.

143
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:57,520
To protect the net as a global, public resource,
Mozilla makes browsers, apps, code, and tools

144
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,910
open and accessible, safe, and free.

145
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:09,670
A force for opportunity with level playing
field rules.

146
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:17,650
Keeping tabs on browser culture and internet
health, explicit in our aspirations, and stated

147
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:29,030
in our manifesto, in support of civil discourse,
collaboration and a wealth of user commitments.

148
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:37,010
Ten principles plus addendum show a clever
red panda that faints like a fossil.

149
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:48,500
Protecting web standards so the Open Web still
rocks.

150
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:56,740
I met Angus at a JS Conference in Brazil in
2015.

151
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:04,430
His book If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript, and
he spoke then about the connections between

152
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,360
language, literature, and JavaScript.

153
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,180
And I don't think that talk would ever have
happened without that book.

154
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:21,680
I also quote directly from some of Angus's
online writing about code poetry and code,

155
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:31,660
and when I do this, I want to indicate that
I'm quoting somebody else's words verbatim:

156
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:40,620
doctrine and dogma, these are the enemy of
good JavaScript, writes Angus Crall, a programmer

157
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,810
who codes English expressively.

158
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:50,470
If Hemingway wrote JavaScript, for whom would
it toll?

159
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,770
Crall's book praises pushing language boundaries.

160
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,050
For earnest, code works tersely and direct.

161
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:07,900
His simplicity conceals the quandaries of
eloquent reduction.

162
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,559
Jane Austin's code is circumspect.

163
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:22,520
If poetry is grace, if poetry connotes and
code commands, the choice of paths reveals

164
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,480
a human face.

165
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,580
An algorithmic style is still in human hands.

166
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:41,800
A 24-author pastiche goes beyond the charm
of ploy, and led me to write sonnets which

167
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,280
I hope will spark some joy - a-ha.

168
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,850
So thank you for indulging my book reviews,
and literary references that may be a little

169
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,940
unfamiliar.

170
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,860
They've given me a way to share some reflections
on culture and code.

171
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:08,480
You may have noticed also, that, in writing,
as in JavaScript, we are always borrowing

172
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,050
and building upon the writing and the work
of others.

173
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:20,250
Especially the texts or the libraries that
have shaped us, and taught us, and particularly

174
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,770
he will our fancy.

175
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:29,290
So there are several slides of reference links
and one more book review sonnet called Big

176
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:38,510
Data, Big Picture in the appendix, and also
on the JSConf EU sonnets page, which is live

177
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:45,010
now online if you really want to keep going,
I'm going to close with an homage to two programmes

178
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:52,500
which is close to my heart, one of Mozilla
text speakers, which I co-founded and led

179
00:20:52,500 --> 00:21:01,160
for a few years, and maybe poised for world
domination like JavaScript, and Global Diversity

180
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:09,170
CFP Day, a young programme that came about
directly through the influence of JSConfs,

181
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,090
and that's been very present here this weekend.

182
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:31,340
So then: Mozilla Tech Speakers is a programme
designed, like Global Diversity CFP Day, to

183
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:41,559
make diverse speakers easier to find and share
skills, tools, and contacts along the way.

184
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:51,850
CFP day grassroots are self- sus - self-sustaining.

185
00:21:51,850 --> 00:22:03,050
Mozilla's programme offers support and training
for web advocates and speakers from a host

186
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,050
of places.

187
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:15,480
These are living proof of working ecosystem,
stand alone programmes launched and thriving,

188
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:23,660
feeding global JavaScript momentum, nomadic
tribes of advocates arriving.

189
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,559
Is it the butterfly effect, or strange attractor?

190
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:36,320
The influence of JSConfs could well be a factor.

191
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:44,880
Today, IBA been speaking about the subtle
and intelligent things that are exchanged

192
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,240
when people come together with good intentions
and a certain spirit.

193
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,540
I've pushed past my own sheer terror to share
what I believe most deeply, that, if you can

194
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:04,700
be true to yourself, there are many amazing
and outrageously cool things you can do from

195
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
there.

196
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:12,470
Like organise a tech event in 60 cities on
the same day from an island in the far north,

197
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:20,450
or write Tennyson et cetera about JavaScript
in 21 days under pressure for a tech conference,

198
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:26,820
so, thank you so much to everyone who has
encouraged me on this journey, and thank you

199
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,770
all today so very, very much for your attention.

200
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:37,870
I'll be putting the slide deck up, and, like
I said, there are lots of resource slides,

201
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,360
and links, and one more sonnet in there.

202
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Have fun.

203
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,850
If you're into John McCarthy and AI, you should
read that one!

204
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,030
Thank you all so much!
