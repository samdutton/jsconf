1
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,260

so this is about don't add the tireless

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,570
don't remake the web api of your dreams

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,420
become real and people want to talk

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,430
about this was what the fresh niggas is

5
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,029
about so um if the thing what is this

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,239
this is maybe or if I go too fast please

7
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,790
trim it up because when I'm tired up go

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,580
too fast so this is maybe the most

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,620
slimmest interpretation of how

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,960
JavaScript developer works with a

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,150
browser right you have some JavaScript

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,890
then you have some kind of black box and

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,120
at the end you get some transcript out

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,620
again so you call a javascript function

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,020
it's awesome magic and your charm script

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,390
again and actually the magic in between

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,239
your C++ so um how many of you are

18
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,510
transcript developers how many of you

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,890
like C++ okay so there's some kind of

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,960
tension like I want to live in this

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,970
world but it soon it gets you on you

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,009
know I just miss one third it's all good

23
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,560
so to wait the water person browser

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,509
indirect is this way the developer comes

25
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,940
along and you use this browser it's nice

26
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,070
it has API whatever you can do whatever

27
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,369
and then also developers tend to they

28
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,320
have create ideas so you have the

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,150
developer you have an idea and then

30
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,500
there's a browser which is basically

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,210
this kind of thing that runs your idea

32
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,180
right but problem is sometimes the idea

33
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,439
doesn't work because there's something

34
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,570
missing and actually that's not good

35
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,280
enough it's it's way hard it's like

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,110
you're developing you have the idea and

37
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,330
you hit a wall because you're missing

38
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,750
api's and other things that pretend you

39
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,170
to make your idea happen and that's

40
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,939
pretty sad so am rhein larue had Alex

41
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:56,329
chairs last week a good thing about the

42
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,250
web and what is capable of and this is

43
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,460
am quoting him if the web doesn't do

44
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,259
something right now it's not because it

45
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,750
can it's not like it's impossible it

46
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,579
just means we haven't gone around doing

47
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:10,759
it yet so it really means imagine that

48
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,070
web can do everything I mean this is

49
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,000
this Muslim the weapons platform bootie

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,140
g Firefox OS thing maybe but also if you

51
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,910
would now be on this auto track web RTC

52
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,540
what's possible there and I really think

53
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,850
that you can do a lot on on the web but

54
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,340
what keeps us back as a developer in

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,260
javascript is the c++ thing in the

56
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,870
middle because what actually okay my

57
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,510
slides are wrong order and so because

58
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,640
actually transcript developers are

59
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,280
pretty much open source guys and mostly

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,140
if there's some issue or thing they come

61
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,210
up with ideas collaborate and for

62
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,090
transcript that works pretty well and

63
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,370
but for c++ there's some kind of tension

64
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,500
and i skip this iRiver or so the web is

65
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,130
it's this kind of open thing right and

66
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,690
transcript likes open open source whose

67
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,040
of you have been at no.10 copper how was

68
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,250
it awesome okay so note helicopter is

69
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,470
like you trunk controlling em drones

70
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,780
with node with an OpenStack because the

71
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,280
protocol is open so you can control

72
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,590
drone and what that happen is it was

73
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,480
like an event of you where you put all

74
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,840
kind of open source software together so

75
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,760
you have a web sockets you got the web

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,040
you got new device api's and then it

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,940
started to put in like open em face

78
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,740
detection stuff such drunk and follow

79
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,860
you and so transcript people reaches

80
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,310
hack together whatever to come along and

81
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,020
so and it's also the question so if you

82
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,000
think about web api is if if you have to

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,680
transcriptome overs being this kind of

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,710
openers Kenny thing of web api is being

85
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,060
some kind of open source that he could

86
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,740
hack as well i mean imagine that that

87
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,140
would be awesome right so this is the

88
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,880
the thing that i wrote for my talk

89
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,740
introduction it's basically person

90
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,330
saying hey you know there's something of

91
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,010
working on the web there's this border I

92
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,320
just draw and I hit it pretty much and I

93
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,380
cannot do anything about it right and

94
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,520
developers is saying yeah you know the

95
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,980
web is open so actually you can change

96
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,110
it and then yeah I cannot fork the web

97
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,820
from github and just change it right and

98
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,549
so but what you can do is you either

99
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,440
jump on his back or you propose some

100
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,510
ideas or what you also can do is you

101
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,670
just grab a browser from github yeah you

102
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,190
implement things there and once it ships

103
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,720
in that browser and it's good auto

104
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,580
browser stopped it becomes back and

105
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,550
everybody's happy so that's what i doing

106
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,290
and love peace and everybody am so sorry

107
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,190
for slightly wrong thing

108
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,250
and so the question might be and should

109
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,050
developers it all makes packs because

110
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,660
that's what it boils down to right if

111
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,520
you want to change things at the end you

112
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,160
got to come up with spec and I think no

113
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,380
developer should not make spec because

114
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,600
writing spec is this kind of putting

115
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,850
natural language in mathematical way

116
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,040
that nobody can misinterpret is it and

117
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,920
it s complicated sounds it is I guess

118
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,310
there are only very few people that has

119
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,680
this kind of crazy mindless where they

120
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,390
understand where there's really small

121
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,480
pitfalls so who of um read the M

122
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,280
scripting specifications or at least

123
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,610
parts of it okay so I kind of go to our

124
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,950
example but basically there if you look

125
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,020
at it things look trivial to you but

126
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,600
it's really like seven or eight steps we

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,030
precise defined what's happening you

128
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,980
think yeah come on it doesn't have to be

129
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,750
that way but it turns out if you would

130
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,940
not people would end up in implementing

131
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,010
things differently and that hurts so

132
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,230
Yuri got to be precise and developers as

133
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,450
good a they are then I heard don't have

134
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,270
this kind of madness so but the other

135
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,070
thing is should've watched propose ideas

136
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,500
and that's definitely yes because

137
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,750
developers are two people that interact

138
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,400
which browser all day and they come with

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,640
this new kind of ideas from outside some

140
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,810
some let's say agency gets a job and the

141
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,100
person there doesn't know the website it

142
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,870
just want something to happen and he

143
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,430
doesn't care if it's possible or not so

144
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,140
it just thinks out of the brow of the

145
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,530
box then developers is ok now I got to

146
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,750
implement it's impossible what if there

147
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,070
would be blah blah blah and we could do

148
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,910
it and so he would maybe face there is a

149
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,250
issue he can recognize it and then make

150
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,990
some kind of proposal to implement this

151
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,510
back out of it and that's actually part

152
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,430
of what I'm going to talk to and should

153
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,669
add the workers also implement a thing

154
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,860
well if you want to I mean it's open

155
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,450
source the browser's are open source so

156
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,880
you can do and I can't talk a little bit

157
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,970
in in my talk about how to make sure

158
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,950
this won't end up as a big pain for you

159
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,970
and to make sure you want to basically

160
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,550
fill this gap about suppose bus and we

161
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,430
all make a new API is in a better place

162
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,350
on the web so a little bit back from of

163
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,750
me and I worked on Bespin so we invert

164
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,200
colors so it's awesome icons and a it

165
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,960
then got into a so is the editors it's

166
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,030
powering cloud nine you'll see you use

167
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,690
cloud nine okay or not let that manage

168
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,630
much and then hacked on firefox then web

169
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,570
console stuff developer tools and then I

170
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,400
got to the eth I'm studying physics in

171
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,250
my fifth and bachelor degree in physics

172
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,380
and then I started working on PDF GS

173
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,140
which should be here on up yeah and so

174
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,810
PDF GS is actually a good offering you

175
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,260
know PDF jas okay that's more so PDF

176
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,290
chase is just it's just a website and

177
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,330
this is actually just an iframe and it

178
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,520
just loads so just to demonstrate it

179
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,350
more I reload and it loads and you can

180
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,630
do selection and it looks pretty stupid

181
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,640
now with invert colors but the thing is

182
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,010
and we really want to have this as a

183
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,900
native thing so it also means we need to

184
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,810
do printing and actually printing on the

185
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,620
web is not as good as it could be but we

186
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,300
have to do it because we want to have

187
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,740
native experience and come in the

188
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,680
browser so what I worked on is new spec

189
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,300
for the canvas element that basically

190
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,800
lets you define the comp you are

191
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
printing and also means that what you

192
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,470
draw actually stays a vector format so

193
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,210
you see we can zoom in and it's still

194
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,860
text it's not register us and you also

195
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,380
can copy this kinds of things so that's

196
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,680
pretty cool and it's gone solved if a

197
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,990
lot of problems i guess but i won't go

198
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,280
into this because what i want to

199
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,850
concentrate on is how what how could you

200
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,669
maybe do these kind of things so i was

201
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,250
working on printing and try to choose

202
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,950
off this so first idea was can we use

203
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,570
maybe as we cheat to solve the problem

204
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,150
and we did some research and we proving

205
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,060
it it doesn't work for us so we need

206
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,130
some new API to make printing work with

207
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,040
canvas element and I was young you know

208
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,040
and me was just like yep let's do this I

209
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,110
always want to do c++ see how the

210
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,140
browser works internally blah blah blah

211
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,670
so you might ask I'm almost a little

212
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,160
person some what is this gecko specific

213
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,550
what I'm if I'm bucket WebKit guys

214
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,980
should I leave this talk I think you

215
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,939
shouldn't

216
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,649
because what I'm going to tell you a

217
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:09,059
thing applies to other browsers as well

218
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:15,269
and so it's channel purpose I don't know

219
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,669
what is know so well let's get started

220
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:20,089
and so there are two things basically

221
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,829
how you can approach getting something

222
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,720
new in the end of the browser server and

223
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,339
first thing you have the idea and then

224
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,739
either you code something up which get

225
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:30,029
ships in browser and then you make a

226
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:32,579
spec or you make the idea it becomes us

227
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,399
back and you then it gets implemented in

228
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,139
our case we need this thing as soon as

229
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,119
possible because for a PDF chest should

230
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:42,089
be as soon as possible the default PDF

231
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,999
viewer in Firefox so we said like here

232
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:47,519
we go with this idea we code it and if

233
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,129
it's good enough we relaunch it I'll

234
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,169
make it this back so the first thing if

235
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,299
you come up with a new idea and you will

236
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,579
proposes it's basically do research to

237
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,939
check or whether something else that's

238
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:01,109
the thing already on the web platform

239
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,809
because the cool thing about web is and

240
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,539
everything is only made once and there's

241
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,079
not too much duplication and and maybe

242
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,119
there's some bizarre way how you can do

243
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,519
the thing you're looking for in it just

244
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,869
takes a lot of time to make specs that

245
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:19,009
there's no need no sense to do twice and

246
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:21,749
also when you have some kind of Eid make

247
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:23,339
a sanity check if it makes sense for the

248
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,759
web runtime and so one thing maybe you

249
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,379
would want to implement an API that

250
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,599
makes unicorns from your flowering and

251
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,849
flying around and makes your name but

252
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,619
that doesn't make sense or you want to

253
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:37,799
make cross script origin request but it

254
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,269
doesn't make sense for security reasons

255
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,179
so then you would say well it's reaches

256
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,699
la possible on the browser because

257
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,899
security is the thing the browser

258
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,749
spilled onto ok so let's say you have

259
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,489
some kind of aid year there's this kind

260
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:53,009
of use case you have so then you would

261
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,169
do an API draft and which is basically

262
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:57,799
you think about what should be in there

263
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,179
what is the use case that you want to

264
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:01,679
solve so it should be use case driven

265
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,929
and that you say this this is on my

266
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,679
cases and the API need to have this kind

267
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,999
of scope that we can solve it and then

268
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,859
if you think about an API and you come

269
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:15,959
up with it you should try to keep it

270
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,899
small simple and general purpose

271
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,029
and thus malden API then easier to

272
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,430
implement and to specify and if it's

273
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,350
simple and other people couldn't use it

274
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,089
as well and general purpose is always

275
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:29,339
good for web because you might have

276
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,199
other ideas and if it's just too

277
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,759
specific for one use case it's not

278
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,129
useful but when its general purposes you

279
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,749
can reuse it for our stuff as well on

280
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:40,199
web then if you have some kind of API

281
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,779
you might want to pro type it or a cart

282
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,420
right some trim code so just write some

283
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,220
code as if the API would exist and then

284
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,199
see if it makes sense because just you

285
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,149
have an idea in your mind and not really

286
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,480
done any kind of code writing and

287
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,619
sometimes remiss leads you and if you

288
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:00,029
just write some code it's actually in

289
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:03,569
running but still there and it's pretty

290
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:05,910
good and to make check where this all

291
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,309
words and then you want to put your

292
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,399
documentation and the API draft avion

293
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,860
somewhere on the web gist github wiki

294
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,439
whatever and you want to share it

295
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:19,980
because um maybe using Twitter Google+

296
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,899
some meet up some other colleagues

297
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,759
foreign company because what do you want

298
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,910
to get this feedback and to see maybe

299
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,470
you missed something the research part

300
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,759
and maybe there's an easy way to do the

301
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,370
API maybe some pitfalls security issues

302
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,649
and once you have some feedback and you

303
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:40,129
feel like okay this is just not too bad

304
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:43,110
you can go to 3m step three which is

305
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,850
doing some kind of proposal so here once

306
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,949
more a proposal is not released back so

307
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:51,959
you might have like examples and all

308
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,550
kinds of thing there but it's not one

309
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,709
percent precise yet so I don't think

310
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,079
people expect that from you and but just

311
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,179
get idea out there may be some some

312
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,629
simple things and so the proposal maybe

313
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:06,019
would include this kind of thing so

314
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,490
what's this here what is the use case

315
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,309
motivation for this and what are some

316
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:13,319
details of the API how's your work and

317
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,990
your rationality for it why what you

318
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,990
think this is useful and and why is

319
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,019
there not a way to do it simpler and the

320
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,209
what we cheat there's a link which also

321
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:27,209
is it says it's a process for adding new

322
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:28,860
features to specifications which also

323
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,569
had some kind of nice points for this

324
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:31,370
kind of thing

325
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,680
and then it's a question where you put

326
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,250
it so how are you do what we G ok nano

327
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,990
one so it stands for web hypertext

328
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,420
application technology working group

329
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,120
it's an insane name but it's actually

330
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,330
and what happened the w3c was not really

331
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,510
up to continue working on html5 what we

332
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,800
now call html5 so five muscle ER upper

333
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,330
and step back from w3c and said this is

334
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,980
not going to work we want to have to

335
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,480
evolve and start some kind of new

336
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,220
mailing list together with Apple at a

337
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,529
time and that's called what we chi so

338
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,570
what we cheese stands for working group

339
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,510
it's there and basically that's where a

340
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,500
lot of development happens so all the

341
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,980
latest thing requestanimationframe and

342
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,510
everything that's happened after HTML

343
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,760
for basically started there and then

344
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,960
later on the w3c recognize okay this is

345
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,520
actually good and started working on

346
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,390
html5 now and there are also w3c working

347
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,730
groups which are an topic-specific and

348
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,279
on dollar version em to do it is to go

349
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,800
to mailings for browser vendors and

350
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,050
that's actually what I did with my epi

351
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,900
and so the first thing that I went to

352
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,760
and there's not a little bit Muslim

353
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,890
specific it's the Deaf API I mean

354
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,650
leanest and it's but turns out is pretty

355
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,770
much just to em Firefox OS specific and

356
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,680
super easily I got no response and I was

357
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,680
said and yeah so one good tip is there

358
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,660
is follow up so what I did was I just

359
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,820
called in they have public meetings and

360
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,270
ask hey why is there no no no response

361
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,370
to my thing isn't that interesting for

362
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,080
you and it just said well it's not our

363
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,500
scope so you might go to def layout so

364
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,750
as an email there and that was response

365
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,890
and Andy I expect to fail because my

366
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,130
idea got rejected so I was upset again

367
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,850
but the thing is the person said your

368
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,560
basic point is good just the API is bad

369
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,270
here's a new API and actually now I

370
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,850
would say the the API that we ended up

371
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,130
in the end is way better and because

372
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,020
what I try to do is was replacing

373
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,420
entire and printing stack with some

374
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,970
complete new API so like is this the web

375
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,100
I'm once you have this kind of API but

376
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,140
it's way better to build on top so the

377
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,270
way that we now do it with exposing just

378
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,890
some kind of new callback for canvas

379
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,840
elements fits way better in what you

380
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,990
have on the page anyway so this is way

381
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,010
better M API and thing is don't expect

382
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,470
that you get it right and because there

383
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,720
are people outside that have just more

384
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,400
experience with all this thing but

385
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,630
what's important is that you're some

386
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,370
kind of driving force and you get the

387
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,100
idea push that somebody gets to for some

388
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,220
forum the requestanimationframe the

389
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,130
thing it's called implemented was some

390
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,960
developer at Mozilla notice people

391
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,510
complaining there's no real way for

392
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,000
gaming to have 60 frames per second

393
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,800
callback kind of thing because set

394
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,990
timeout doesn't really work so he made

395
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,210
an API somebody else implemented in

396
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,120
shipley in firefox 4 beta 4 and now it's

397
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,830
in all browsers and the game industry is

398
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,880
happy so at we just making their idea

399
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,450
garter and I'm late on time so now maybe

400
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,820
so maybe this is why where you stop you

401
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,110
know you have this API and you have the

402
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,790
feeling somebody else cares about it but

403
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,770
now let's go let's go more into let's

404
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,630
code right so good to know em if you

405
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,520
want to really do the coding card and

406
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,620
really implemented in powder it really

407
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,900
requires passion that you that you want

408
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,970
to do is because it's going to be a long

409
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,940
run expect pain so you want to make sure

410
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,990
and this kind of teamwork thing and so

411
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,760
we got to work together other people

412
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,560
because browsers will turn out to be

413
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,959
this complete piece a complex piece and

414
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,420
you just don't get everything by

415
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,400
yourself so you got to talk to some

416
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,750
people and don't underestimate

417
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,670
time-consuming forgetting something you

418
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,070
in and the time-consuming things are

419
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,810
there there are some API said pretty

420
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,350
simple for example for the cameras and

421
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,060
there were used to be no way to set the

422
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,790
dash on four lines so if you have a line

423
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,380
you want to have a dash there was no way

424
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,420
and then there was PDF chairs and said

425
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,130
well we just implemented some kind of

426
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,170
API for is and it turns out every

427
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,110
rendering back end has Navy I to set

428
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,630
dashes four lines right so it turned out

429
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,730
to be like 10 or maybe 20 lines of

430
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,140
vote for writing this kind of feature

431
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,870
and everybody else just worked around it

432
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,880
all the time and but in my case it

433
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,290
really turns out to be some more time

434
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,559
consuming and the other thing is before

435
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,660
I start coding anything make sure that

436
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,460
the thing that you want to implement API

437
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,000
is reviewed by somebody else and because

438
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,320
otherwise you might implement something

439
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,299
you spend like a month and then you like

440
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,669
here's a code um if they say what's just

441
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,330
not useful and it's just them yeah it

442
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,130
just makes you depressive so make sure

443
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,020
that there's some kind of fruit for you

444
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,140
so okay so low let's go let's implement

445
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,290
this but wait so if you just implement

446
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,390
it there's some kind Hall of pain i

447
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,150
called it so some best practices that i

448
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,950
came up to which would have made me or

449
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,320
made my life easier so one thing is find

450
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,730
a mentor if you want to implement this

451
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,030
so even if you're not used to this kind

452
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,799
of browser you might have really small

453
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,919
questions that takes you hours to get

454
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,530
started like how is this working what's

455
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,210
the best practice for this and if you

456
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,620
have kind of mentor that you can

457
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,700
approach it's pretty good to make the

458
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,410
mentor might be a person that responds

459
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,380
to your API proposal and or you just ask

460
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,100
on IRC channel for info gecko of WebKit

461
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,870
or for Chrome or wherever you want to

462
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,520
implement it if somebody wants to help

463
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,309
you with doing that and mostly there's

464
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,679
at least one person in each kind of

465
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,200
topic area that's passionate about what

466
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,030
you want to do so it should be hard

467
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,220
fundamental next thing is open it back

468
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,770
because the back is a good place to keep

469
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,700
track of a process and then maybe you

470
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,590
want to ask for some guidance how they

471
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,540
co should look like and where to look up

472
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,000
code if there are some examples existing

473
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,160
out there and some pointers where you

474
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,950
look up and maybe also asked what was

475
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,419
the best way to communicate with our

476
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:51,850
people where it's IRC or mailing lists

477
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,860
and the other thing is ask before i get

478
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,900
the press so it's pretty simple to just

479
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,850
sit in your room in code and it doesn't

480
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,940
work because c++ and whatever and what i

481
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,620
figured out it's it's way better if you

482
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,960
just ask a small question on IRC and

483
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,630
people are pretty helpful and they make

484
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,549
sure you don't get depressed and you get

485
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:11,680
going working

486
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,330
and some other thing is that you can

487
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,610
look up lots of talks and wikis out

488
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,290
there so forget CO and WebKit there's

489
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,630
tons how tooling works if there's

490
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,660
similar code similar box and like if you

491
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,580
do canvas implementation there's a lot

492
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,110
of bugs about canvas and how it got

493
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,640
implement so this might give seen

494
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,470
feeling which code parts you got to look

495
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,540
into and also gives you feeling about

496
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,250
what people you should look out you and

497
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,580
what people to ping on IRC and then for

498
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,620
dogs may be so I mean this is not this

499
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,470
is not the glory of how you really do it

500
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,050
it's more like an idea maybe what would

501
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,330
help you and so things you might want to

502
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,280
look up is build system because you want

503
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,440
to build the five Firefox of WebKit at

504
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,030
some point maybe how to manage

505
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,400
management is done internally they have

506
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,680
some kind of reference counting and then

507
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,960
there are internal trees representations

508
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,030
if you work on some kind of layout thing

509
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,980
there's a layout read as a few tree

510
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,870
there's content readers daikon distri

511
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,620
and so on and maybe just ask do any any

512
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,080
of these or whatever and then there are

513
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,640
also coding conventions that you should

514
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,740
look up and get a little bit used to and

515
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,860
also debugging turns out to be art at

516
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,920
least for Firefox and I could expect

517
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,500
this may be better for WebKit so for

518
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,650
instance a cheeky be and who knows what

519
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:31,480
she be chibi says for okay more so it's

520
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,970
a command line based debugger and

521
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,580
basically you type s you hit enter and

522
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,620
it steps to the next line so its depth

523
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,140
it's pretty dumb but it's pretty cool

524
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,960
thing to work with I found out and also

525
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,460
it's some kind of new tool that I

526
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,100
haven't played maybe otherwise printer

527
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,430
has helped me a lot because I'm I'm

528
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,780
person that needs to look at what

529
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,850
happens so I basically have wrote five

530
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,800
lines of code and 20 pin devs maybe but

531
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,300
it helped me and so the other thing is

532
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,330
you might get stuck and then if you get

533
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,610
stuck it's good to look out for what

534
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,230
kind of people could have me there so

535
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,990
good person to to a way good way to find

536
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,610
these other people is to go to your

537
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,250
mentor on r cos K I'm stuck in this area

538
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,750
what are the people I should approach to

539
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,430
and also ask when are they online

540
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,860
because it turns out they might be on

541
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,290
the west coast so if you think in this

542
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,670
timezone you should ping them in the

543
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,360
evening or

544
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,280
in Japan so in the morning all these

545
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,640
kind of things and also a good thing is

546
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,250
get some c++ book because you can then

547
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,650
just read chapter through okay now we do

548
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,770
the actual coding I got to speed up and

549
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,450
so one thing they come across maybe is

550
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,640
things don't work the way expect and it

551
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,140
turns sometimes I was it's just a known

552
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,580
bug in the platform since a long time

553
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,740
and you try to fix it because you think

554
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,150
you broke it but that's actually not the

555
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,670
case so just avoid it and say there is a

556
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,880
bug out on here and then sometimes you

557
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,710
come up why are you implementing there's

558
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,750
an issue with the API design so for

559
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,760
instance they the API we had worse at

560
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,190
the beginning a synchronous but turned

561
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,520
out that doesn't make sense so we change

562
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,380
the API but the thing to watch out is

563
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,990
there due to API chains with feed bag or

564
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,210
on the mailing list again such that our

565
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,100
people that follow the process can jump

566
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,059
into and help out there and try to get

567
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,799
the API right from the start because if

568
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,630
you ship something on the web and you

569
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,160
got to change it too much later on

570
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,620
that's not making you a lot of friends

571
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,890
and as said if you come across outer-box

572
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,320
accordion file it back but then say this

573
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,690
is not my topic because it sounds a

574
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,040
little bit narrow minded then you just

575
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,230
stay on your thing but otherwise you

576
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,090
just spread out in there too much of

577
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,419
Mars and if you stuck just create a

578
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:45,040
different wherever you have create a

579
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,350
crash lock whatever you have and dump it

580
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,910
somewhere on a bucking horse seen ask

581
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,360
for help so I was really one pattern

582
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,900
worked on i resubmitted crash logs and I

583
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,690
was okay i'm assuming really to be this

584
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,240
guy or it is stupid i did that cannot

585
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,460
continue so i just looked at one line

586
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,290
say yeah do you call this kind of

587
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,900
function no i don't oh oh yeah now it

588
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,910
totally makes sense so every small thing

589
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,580
but if we get stuck we should try to

590
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,290
dump as much as information as you have

591
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,200
because it makes people easier to get

592
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,320
you going again and step back sometimes

593
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,410
so just take a break is the thing that

594
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,910
you make doesn't make sense we

595
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,460
implemented that worried maybe no fun

596
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,590
normal thing and don't question yourself

597
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,429
so I would say you're not dump it's just

598
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,669
a huge thing to hack a browser and just

599
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:38,620
this way it is so

600
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,290
now it comes landing these things and so

601
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,180
if you have some code is it's more or

602
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,070
less working in Parliament if make sure

603
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,630
you get in a feedback cycle as soon as

604
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,880
possible so attached some wipe which is

605
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,490
working process on a bug and ask

606
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,900
somebody took your feedback on this

607
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,480
because that avoids that you continue in

608
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,070
the wrong direction and got to refactor

609
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,420
it later on it is makes it way more and

610
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,100
way more nice and also it gives you more

611
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,510
kind of team feeling because we work

612
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,160
with some other people and it helps you

613
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,640
and to get motivated and and then

614
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,650
writing tests for browsers actually hard

615
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,510
because normally you write tests in the

616
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,340
browser but now as you're writing for

617
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,700
the browser you write test it are in the

618
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,320
browser the testing the browsers so it's

619
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,360
kind of meter testing writing and

620
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,540
there's some kind of pretty cool

621
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,270
frameworks there it's pretty tricky but

622
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,290
pretty cool and yeah upload wipes as

623
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,110
often as possible and also yeah so the

624
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,120
reason why you want also to upload

625
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,220
working process as often as possible is

626
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,960
if your machine dies you have some code

627
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,929
ups up rare another thing is if you for

628
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:45,370
some reason got to step away and

629
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,620
somebody else might take a look at your

630
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,630
code and can continue from there and if

631
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,880
you upload wipes pretty often you can

632
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,650
say okay what what was his decision

633
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,450
making what happened in the meantime and

634
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,330
that means maybe you step back but three

635
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,800
months later you see on Twitter yeah

636
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,150
this feature landed and you know you

637
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,250
carried ninety percent of the work maybe

638
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,640
ten percent was done by someone else and

639
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,780
for patch file make sure they're clean

640
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,150
sometimes you got to split them up and

641
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,340
for reviewer the does the extra cool

642
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,950
thing look them up and request and also

643
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,840
don't hesitate to change the review

644
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,050
because sometimes don't out people are

645
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,110
too time-consuming and if you don't if

646
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,000
something unclear stated because words

647
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,440
if you just come new coding and cress

648
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,780
afterwards if something is unclear maybe

649
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,520
leave a comment in code to make sure you

650
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,110
don't forget about it I've got to speed

651
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,450
up even more so now landed assume your

652
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,830
patch plan it's the first thing to do is

653
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,809
the victory dance because it's pretty

654
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:39,130
awesome to get something in a browser

655
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,610
and it was made two months of work and

656
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,460
then expect fall out so crashes the the

657
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,140
word thing is you have something and you

658
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,640
worked on it and then you see ten people

659
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,620
crash because of your code but

660
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,300
that's normal i would say if you right

661
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,300
the first time and as somebody reviewed

662
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,400
your code you know it's not just your

663
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,090
fault that's usual and the thing is some

664
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,830
channel thing the key thing about

665
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,300
getting this thing done is come to in

666
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,370
communication so the thing is iris

667
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,260
emailing this phone to get the thing

668
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,390
that's most convenient for you if it's

669
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,880
more time soon spread the people work

670
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,400
with many smell quebecer if something's

671
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,620
i could really ask because otherwise get

672
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,870
can get terrible you might get kind of

673
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,570
these messages on IRC so you stayed here

674
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,300
newbie and then they gonna explain your

675
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,710
way more so people are really open to

676
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,830
want to help you if you communicate keep

677
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,720
it short precise and keep it down to the

678
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,610
arguments because everybody can only

679
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,730
handle a little bit of stuff and be open

680
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,890
for new tools like this testing things

681
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,260
and different time zones to keep in mind

682
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,510
and also this driving force that

683
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,400
basically you're maybe not you the

684
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,500
implementation but you ping people to

685
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,570
make sure things keep happening it's

686
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,880
time consuming and communicating the

687
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,350
open because other people can jump in

688
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,440
and help you and expect to be wrong he'd

689
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,540
never done this made before so it met it

690
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,280
and say okay I was wrong you were right

691
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,950
and this is the way we do it and you

692
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,480
won't get replies with any day because

693
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,830
these people are busy if you don't

694
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,360
really get a rebus within a week you

695
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,240
might want to follow up again so what's

696
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,860
the status on the API worked on its

697
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,690
proposal to what we see Manning list and

698
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,210
there's no feedback so if you really

699
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,460
want to help me and make me happy so

700
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,309
give the happy icon there please talk to

701
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:22,510
me if you're interested in printing on

702
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,330
the web make it better and maybe you got

703
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,330
some feedback there and so that's

704
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,250
supposed to be fun oh yeah so actually

705
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,290
and the cool thing is just something CD

706
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,660
internal so this is capping miss the sea

707
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,040
bass bass thing that I was talking about

708
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,530
before you really see how is happening

709
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,720
and it's crazy going on when it's

710
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,790
all calls into the c++ and you see it

711
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,410
what happens and then that goes up to

712
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,870
javascript again and so it's really cool

713
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,640
and you also see why things are slow

714
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,020
sometimes and yep any learn C++ wizard

715
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,760
school for some reasons you learn new

716
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,030
tools and there's a lot of fun community

717
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,130
so this way Mike chokes somewhat of

718
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,560
themselves and you learn a lot of

719
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,240
communication skills

720
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,130
you also if there are some small fixes

721
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,770
that need to be done in C++ you know how

722
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,260
to do it so you can do it and don't have

723
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,300
to like write transcript to avoid this

724
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,340
back because now which stuff into you

725
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,950
and also the cool thing is once you fix

726
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,050
something like that say firefox you're

727
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,510
good the code for WebKit doesn't look

728
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,070
too different maybe so you can fix it

729
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,520
back in WebKit as well way more simpler

730
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,890
it's please open source project browsers

731
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,140
and it ships two million users so yeah

732
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,260
it's kind of big impact thing and maybe

733
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,700
something you don't do in your normal

734
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,400
life and if you walk refuse because

735
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,350
these people you might talk to our CEO

736
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,510
may too they basically build the web big

737
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,880
parts of it and you can work with them

738
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,400
which is kind of okay that's pretty cool

739
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,970
so links and to be done I didn't have

740
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,280
time and but if you want to have links

741
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,990
so I have something in my mind just

742
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,120
follow me on twitter you know and I

743
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,760

744
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,010
