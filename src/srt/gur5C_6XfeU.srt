1
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:23,110

hello how are we all so I'm going to ask

2
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,189
for your forgiveness in advance because

3
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:27,730
I'm extremely nervous so what do we

4
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:33,970
figure out for like participants so okay

5
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,640
yeah you can come up I know that max was

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,290
gonna come up to and then like you want

7
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,680
to pick a random person oh yeah yeah

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,980
might as well do it now mom all right I

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,530
random one person who wants to be a

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,879
guinea pig for prototyping black box

11
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,129
let's actually pick let's pick let's

12
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,080
pick a few people and you guys can rock

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,900
paper scissor house that you anyone

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,979
anyone I don't you and uh stop you yeah

15
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,010
all right coming up we have a rock paper

16
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:15,580
scissor yeah yeah I'm sorry actually we

17
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,360
can just yeah all right all right ready

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,880
you guys know this works all right ready

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,670
okay this is rock this is paper it's a

20
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,939
scissor look you ready yeah at the same

21
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:31,630
time yeah this is this is important it

22
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,649
is Rock Paper Scissors shoot are you

23
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:42,039
ready at the same time and then

24
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,020
hopefully it'll work out hopefully we

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,520
don't have a circular dependency I think

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,329
we'll be okay I already rock paper

27
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,740
scissor shoot oh you're out all right

28
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,520
out here yeah all right

29
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:07,760
never go with rock all right raining too

30
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:14,790
ready Rock Paper Scissors shoot oh wow

31
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,019
we didn't even plan this it's just

32
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:27,140
actually this exciting hey rock paper

33
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:35,370
scissor shoot Wow good job Peter nice

34
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,450
work all right okay so brief history on

35
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,030
this I kind of got involved in this

36
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,620
about a year and a half ago I started

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,030
working with a place in Portland Oregon

38
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,610
called casa diablo it's a world's first

39
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,140
vegan strip club and we're trying to

40
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,180
kind of modernize the strip club

41
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,720
industry and so this is kind of grown

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,930
from the little sensor situation that

43
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,760
we've created in the private area so

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,230
that we can kind of monitor who's back

45
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,079
there whether they've paid that sort of

46
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,480
thing so it's turned into something

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,590
that's a lot of fun for a lot of people

48
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,420
in my whole thing is trying to make a

49
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,920
little more accessible for people you

50
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,569
know like software developers kind of

51
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,150
usually look at hardware they're like

52
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,790
that's hard you know so it's really not

53
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,049
that hard and I guess that's what we're

54
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,760
going to try to illustrate today um the

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,780
one thing I didn't realize is we're

56
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,130
probably gonna need like a computer or

57
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,680
two for you guys so I don't know if you

58
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,600
guys have your laptop's like grab that

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:43,690
and so let me see here

60
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:50,200
right

61
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,040
I guess is going to be more of like a

62
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,780
classroom demonstration that an actual

63
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,220
talk but so go ahead an open up your

64
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,990
black box is and we've got everything we

65
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,970
need maybe you guys can show what you've

66
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,160
got in here LEDs jumpers wires we're all

67
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,930
familiar with wires yeah okay arduino

68
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,520
USB cable some screws you don't need

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,400
those right now that is the ultrasonic

70
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,910
sensor and I actually manufactured these

71
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,830
for you now just the just the cabling

72
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,640
and so I guess what we're going to do is

73
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,950
get your bread boards out and open up

74
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:48,050
your pin packaging

75
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,030
and what we're going to do is we're

76
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,919
going to take our ultrasonic sensor and

77
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,660
you can pretty much pick anywhere that

78
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,550
you want to place it but see if I have

79
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:08,850
mine yeah so plug it in make sure you

80
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,570
plug it in I figure out the best way to

81
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,820
show everyone here but with the

82
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,190
breadboard you'll want to plug it in

83
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,700
yeah like that well not necessarily on

84
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,500
the inside but just so that each pin is

85
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,330
in its own number slot not just a mine

86
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,120
doesn't have that but yours do yeah I

87
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,210
just plug it right in that was the goal

88
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,740
yeah just anywhere as long as it's each

89
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,630
pin has its own way all right and then

90
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,620
we get our dreams out a couple of our

91
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,640
jumpers and on these to explain what

92
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,630
these guys are these are little

93
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,580
ultrasonic sensors and for those of you

94
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,380
who are at node copter this is the same

95
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,700
type of sensor that's in the bottom of

96
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,470
the copters that that pings the floor

97
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,229
and sees how far away it is and we're

98
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,400
going to use that tape that same

99
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,890
mechanism to detect if someone has

100
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:13,620
walked in front of the alarm so we're

101
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,510
going to go from there's four pins on

102
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,700
this there's VCC which is your your

103
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,650
power ground and then there's the

104
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,800
trigger and the echo pin so go and plug

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,300
it in and from VCC we can go to on our

106
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:38,910
Arduino which says 3.3 volts VCC

107
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,800
labeled right here and so on the top

108
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:54,889
Yeah right there and then we're also

109
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:57,740
going to take the last pin which is

110
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,630
ground going to put that into the ground

111
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:15,230
on the Arduino

112
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,190
ground is just below ya 3.3 and I guess

113
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,330
while they're doing that everyone's kind

114
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,010
of we're all familiar with the Arduino

115
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,020
concept they already know show of hands

116
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,479
if you'd like me to explain it ok so the

117
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,030
Arduino is a like a prototyping device

118
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,500
it's got a little very inexpensive

119
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,139
processor on the AVR process or it's an

120
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,970
8-bit processor and it allows you to

121
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,510
upload C code to it and make it do just

122
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,800
about anything it's got some general

123
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,889
purpose i/o pins analog and digital so

124
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,380
you can connect all sorts of you know

125
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,840
prefab devices to it you can make your

126
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,220
own circuits that sort of thing and it's

127
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,960
kind of like the step before you

128
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,180
actually go and print a circuit and that

129
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,120
sort of thing so it plugs in with USB

130
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,860
it's got all the USB controllers and

131
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,150
everything it's very easy to get it on

132
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,039
to your system whether you're using mac

133
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:13,990
or windows or unix in my case and I

134
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,100
guess while they're doing that we could

135
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,600
use this time for any other questions to

136
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,370
you have a question to break it mmm I

137
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,710
mean I've been like traveling from

138
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,510
Portland here with a bunch of them just

139
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,030
in my laptop bag um no they're from what

140
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,370
I can tell it's pretty hard to like like

141
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,459
short-circuited or you know overload it

142
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,380
I'm sure it's possible but I haven't as

143
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,900
far as I'm aware broken any so any other

144
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,769
questions ok

145
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:47,899
okay so trigger an echo in the demo that

146
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,910
I've loaded on these you'll go to pin 10

147
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,819
and pin 11 on their green which is over

148
00:08:52,819 --> 00:09:12,850
here yes so let's see you're going to go

149
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,589
your trigger pin it will come over here

150
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:26,330
to 11

151
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,310
that one will go to your trigger should

152
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:38,920
be too yeah all right and then we saw

153
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,450
you guys about your trigger and rock

154
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,990
opens plugin okay and go ahead and plug

155
00:09:43,990 --> 00:10:10,510
it into your computer so they're just

156
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,580
like they're just like us be TTYL

157
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,730
devices and so you kind of UNIX they

158
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,290
just open them up as a file descriptor

159
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,170
and start talking to them and you know

160
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,610
you can write your own protocol or you

161
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,340
can use variety of different libraries

162
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,870
that are available for example fermata

163
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,600
is anyone familiar with Fermata yeah

164
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,790
it's pretty handy it's kind of like a

165
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,350
communication protocol that you can just

166
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,930
upload to the Arduino once and then you

167
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,160
can take all of your programming and

168
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,020
just move it up into javascript

169
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,640
something like that i'm not actually

170
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,120
going to demo that today i wanted to

171
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,160
kind of bring the demo down a little bit

172
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,230
and make it as basic as possible and

173
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,360
kind of prove that it's not as difficult

174
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,120
as it seems but we'll see how that works

175
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,560
up

176
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,780
yeah okay so you can go ahead and npm

177
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,050
install jess confi you demo let me show

178
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:34,930
you what the package name is

179
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:45,030
so okay you know I completely forgot put

180
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,770
in a net so it's a jay s con tu dash

181
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,130
demo and hopefully it will install

182
00:11:50,130 --> 00:12:03,450
properly yeah yeah well I've haven't

183
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:20,310
having Wi-Fi problems yeah that's that's

184
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,930
been that's been an issue for me the

185
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,550
other issues were not we're not getting

186
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,470
anything connected to yoga we might have

187
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,020
to just jump ahead and show everyone

188
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:44,170
what the end result is what was that

189
00:12:44,180 --> 00:13:05,500
sure

190
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,660
sorry

191
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:21,550
and work

192
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:30,780
you

193
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,420
well we have that at least for some

194
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,150
reason my mind's not functioning so

195
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,670
maybe I have to bring some of yours over

196
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,140
something yeah that's not getting data

197
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:59,060
again yes this is awesome totally

198
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,620
unrelated but I just want to tell you

199
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,930
guys now because I think it's cool

200
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,450
someone asked if they could print their

201
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,640
boarding pass or like a train pass that

202
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,720
they forgot and I was like I don't know

203
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,770
as or can't goes I don't even know

204
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,300
apparently we've set something up where

205
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,110
if you send an email to print at jay's

206
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,780
coffee you it will print on a printer up

207
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:23,000
there this is what I'm told so I want

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,800
you guys to ddos that thing so it's

209
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,930
oh so I look forward to boarding my

210
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,660
flight as Tiffany Conroy yeah yeah it's

211
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,399
me yeah absolutely yeah so try that out

212
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,320
we'll put the email address if you can

213
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,089
remember it print at JS comp that you

214
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:48,899
put it up during lunch number one

215
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,000
glencoe number two number two is also

216
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,700
apparently there are some really cool

217
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,230
stuff might may or may not involve node

218
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,750
copters and WebGL that someone's put

219
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,269
together as a result of node copter that

220
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:06,100
is going to be shown at the end of lunch

221
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,170
so if you're gonna eat lunch you might

222
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,910
want to be in this room towards the end

223
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,940
of it that's number two so look forward

224
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:22,360
to that sweet okay well we might just

225
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,130
have to work with your guys's computers

226
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,399
because mine is not functioning kind of

227
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,440
expected that but we had it working at

228
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,720
one point I swear if any of you that are

229
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,490
actually interested in this I'd be happy

230
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,019
to get working again and you can come

231
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,410
take a look at it but the idea behind

232
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,720
this is we're going to try to get at

233
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,130
least one of these up and running with a

234
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,709
little alarm that will actually connect

235
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:48,160
with a little library that subsec wrote

236
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,010
called shoot and that will make it

237
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,690
really easy for us to actually just pipe

238
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,640
data events directly from the Arduino

239
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,760
through node into the browser and the

240
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,470
possibilities there have been pretty

241
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,540
much limitless I did a talk at node conf

242
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,140
earlier this year where I set it up and

243
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,209
with twilio and Carter help me with that

244
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,550
and we made the entire audiences phones

245
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,959
ring and I wish that I could have done

246
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,720
that but Coolio's service in Germany is

247
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,360
still a little shaky so okay so we

248
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,949
should be able to get at least someone's

249
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:42,440
working with just typing node Express

250
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,350
although you may have to npm install

251
00:16:44,350 --> 00:17:06,329
first

252
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,699
what are we going to yeah that's um

253
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:12,799
another one of those preparation things

254
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:20,270
we probably should have thought of so i

255
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,380
guess i'll take another opportunity for

256
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:29,120
any questions yeah you also i added a a

257
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,059
command line option so if you are on a

258
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,820
Mac they named the argument as a little

259
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:41,360
differently so it's okay oh we can see

260
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:50,240
if that's a problem yes and so you can

261
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,200
just start node Express dash dash device

262
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,830
and then the path to the device

263
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,120
hopefully maybe max can save this pissed

264
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,950
off yeah well and we had it working

265
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,710
about 15 minutes before the talk so not

266
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,140
sure exactly what's happened but I guess

267
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,530
that's kind of the nature of demos 80 80

268
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:42,600
or 8,000 3000

269
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,230
yeah the the Wi-Fi hasn't been working

270
00:18:45,230 --> 00:19:00,500
for me all day well yes I have loaded

271
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,030
the sketch on all of these that that

272
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,580
basically just it doesn't in a little

273
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,320
initialization routine and then checks

274
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,840
the average distance and then compares

275
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,090
that against new readings and if it's

276
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,680
off by more than an inch then it then it

277
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:26,280
sends a trigger event down the pipe sure

278
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,590
hopefully so is that working now sweetly

279
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,720
awesome well maybe you can try

280
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:45,030
restarting Express yes that is good

281
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,450
so I probably should have named my talk

282
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,800
live debugging but all right okay great

283
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,470
so at the very least we can kind of show

284
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,210
you what the end result is do you want

285
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,670
to trigger another oh yeah well so

286
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,220
what's the so remind me what the device

287
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,280
is for like the original use case so the

288
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,440
original use cases for this is um we

289
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,790
have a private area at the club where

290
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,140
well it's just so that we know at a

291
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,510
glance which of our booths are occupied

292
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,010
which aren't and and whether they've

293
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,900
been paid for or not so this is a really

294
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,610
easy way to say is our body on the chair

295
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,490
and is that associated with a ticket

296
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,470
that was paid for so then there's a

297
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,910
durations that are associated with that

298
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:43,310
as well so you might have to just sit

299
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,390
there for a second pull your hand back

300
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,500
just a little bit we might say let's

301
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,760
switch our sensors out because mine

302
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:57,860
might be broken alright so there we go

303
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:05,840
so finally go ahead and restart it cat

304
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:15,999
picture compliments of Max Ogden

305
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:34,120
and then of course I'll break it again

306
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,000
so you remember that part where I said

307
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,910
hardware isn't really that hard

308
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,570
sometimes it is as you can see here it's

309
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,910
still a lot of fun and through the use

310
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,670
of things like JavaScript nodejs node

311
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:58,530
Fermata Johnny 5 sorry yeah so I guess

312
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,970
we can at the very least kind of show

313
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,830
what we're supposed to be doing here so

314
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,290
in our Express server it's it's a pretty

315
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,590
basic application very beginning hair

316
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,740
we're just requiring serial port may or

317
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,850
may not be familiar with that it's a

318
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,590
very very easy library to use to get

319
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,280
serial devices into your your note app

320
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,200
we define the device get an express

321
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,100
server running and through the use of

322
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,760
shoe we're able to grab data events

323
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,850
which the data function right here is

324
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,190
actually receiving either a 0 or a 1

325
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,440
directly from the Arduino and then

326
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,580
depending on the the status then we we

327
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,360
push it out to the browser via stock so

328
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,120
over here we're just requiring shoe

329
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,420
starting a stream and defining either

330
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,850
waiting which is what you were seeing or

331
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:03,510
oh my Gurd and then just some really

332
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:09,420
basic you know Dom manipulation so so

333
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,040
what did you do to get that work working

334
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,200
did you just unplug it and look like an

335
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,220
inner

336
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,210
yeah it's it's supposed to be blinking

337
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:30,350
months for sure okay well I should still

338
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,910
I should still beginning packets from

339
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,799
the Arduino which we're not right now so

340
00:23:33,799 --> 00:24:13,550
I oh I see okay yes

341
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,790
so the thing that's nice about the

342
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,560
Arduino is you have a really easy to use

343
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:30,610
well actually let me show you here so

344
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:36,310
with Arduino it has just variables that

345
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,860
you defined like if you if you have a

346
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,050
certain pin number that you plug it into

347
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,030
on here on your header so like what

348
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:53,510
we've what we've done here is oh great

349
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,490
so as you're as you're pinning your

350
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,430
breadboard you have a row of pins on

351
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,040
your on your Arduino so you just plug

352
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,100
them in and in the Arduino code or if

353
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,360
you're choosing if you're opting for

354
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,360
something like fremada or Johnny 5 which

355
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,980
95 actually takes care of almost all of

356
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,720
it you're just kind of like I have an

357
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,030
ultrasonic sensor initialize it and then

358
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,800
it's doing it mmhmm yeah that's that's

359
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,870
all it is all all you're doing is this

360
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,510
little wiring and then and you're

361
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,890
welcome to take a look at it after that

362
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,920
after the demo but it's very very

363
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,350
straightforward so it's it's again it's

364
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,260
a prototyping device it's very simple to

365
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,580
just get started then once you're sure

366
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,960
you know what your circuits doing then

367
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,430
you can you know either do like

368
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,650
perfboard and actually solder a circuit

369
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,750
or print it or whatnot so here's the

370
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,830
example of the the code that that's

371
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,050
running on each of these that's failing

372
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,650
right now it was working but so here's

373
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:03,550
like for example to set up the actual

374
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:11,920
triggering of a sensor and so all we're

375
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,669
doing is using a serial print

376
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:17,489
to send the status of whether or not the

377
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:19,739
the sensor sees a difference in the

378
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:26,359
distance that it's measuring I just

379
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:33,090
let's take a look the very good zeros

380
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,499
yeah I can see that those are awesome

381
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:58,870
zero so as a matter of fact so let's see

382
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,950
let's try flipping these two around real

383
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:11,060
quick

384
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,620
so all right so if we've got this one

385
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,390
working why don't why don't we plug the

386
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:28,360
monitor and over here do you have an

387
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:40,480
adapter for the mac finally so I guess

388
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,580
there you have it black box live

389
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,919
debugging at jas con for you thank you

390
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:47,080
very much you guys I'm sorry that that

391
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,460
didn't go smoothly as I'd expected but

392
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,679
other any other questions or do any

393
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,640
questions yes yes so to recap we just

394
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,529
got a box that we had no idea what was

395
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:58,240
in it had our laptop so we had no idea

396
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,580
we needed to install stomachs you

397
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,380
published a new thing to NPM like 10

398
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,980
minutes ago in p.m. we built in arduino

399
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,799
circuit plugged in voltage ground signal

400
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,640
put on a distance sensor plug it into

401
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,980
our computers use chris's library for

402
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,990
serial port stuff to get data from the

403
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,549
US be absolutely amazing to the web

404
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:22,090
browser / sub stocks chew notes dreamy

405
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,789
and then detected Peter oh that's crazy

406
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:32,930
yes
