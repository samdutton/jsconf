00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,309
[Applause]

3
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:13,070
thank you very much

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,540
trigger warning the next talk includes

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,600
mentions and pictures of diseases micro

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,880
massive devices and unapproved medical

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,750
treatments my talk is called how

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,039
community made me a t1d cyborg diabetes

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
is a condition condition for

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,120
approximately 420 million people

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,660
worldwide roughly 10% of them like 40

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,050
million are type 1 diabetes type 1

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,219
diabetes often and ridiculously refer to

14
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,840
as the bap type of diabetes is

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,090
irreversible it involves multiple daily

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,890
injections and finger pricks and gives

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,989
you rollercoasters in matters of blood

18
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,899
glucose resulting in unstable physical

19
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,699
condition this talk is a short shout-out

20
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,220
to the community that calls itself we

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,710
are not waiting because we are not

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,810
waiting for an adequate medical

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,869
treatment of type 1 diabetes which is

24
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,780
possible but not approved I was

25
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,759
diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2005

26
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,930
so was my daughter in 2016 there as of

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,630
current best approved therapy include

28
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,850
wearing an insulin pump connected to

29
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,189
your body and a continuous glucose meter

30
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,430
a CGM measuring the glucose level every

31
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,030
5 minutes

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,240
many more people with type 1 diabetes

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,259
like 97.5% are still on a injection pen

34
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,590
and fingerpick therapy therapy also

35
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,290
includes recalculating your required

36
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,170
insulin dosage on a daily level counting

37
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,750
carbohydrates in everything you eat and

38
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,119
convert that into the insulin units it

39
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,060
took me 13 years a child and a community

40
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,420
to learn how to best treat that beast

41
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,130
during these 13 years I mostly ignored

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,550
it

43
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,390
I felt unequal I had doubts I was

44
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,520
mismanaged as well as I mismanaged

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,600
myself and in fact I was lucky to still

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,380
be alive

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:34,340
and then in November 2018 I became a t1d

48
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,700
cyborg and my daughter becomes a t1d

49
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,160
cyborg at night so today I wear an old

50
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,010
insulin pump with a cannula going into

51
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,709
my upper leg or my tummy I wear a CGM

52
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,769
that continuous glucose meter on my

53
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:55,280
tummy or my upper arm I constantly carry

54
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,600
with me Micro PC in my pocket as well as

55
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,590
my smartphone

56
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,570
so let's attach to all that and I

57
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,300
basically depend on internet and rock

58
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:16,310
tape a cyborg MacGyver and the

59
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,959
Neuromancer all are ones

60
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,480
so color let's come to that Micro PC the

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,430
community is actively developing the

62
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,500
software that runs on that little PC

63
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,290
device it's written in JavaScript go

64
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,310
Python bash script and other languages

65
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,290
you have to build that device yourself

66
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,380
it's do-it-yourself and still or because

67
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,900
of that it's more advanced than any

68
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,480
other commercially available insulin

69
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,610
delivery system in fact there is no

70
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,459
commercial system that administers

71
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,329
insulin on prediction my gratitude goes

72
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,810
to this community

73
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,019
it was 2014 that four people closed that

74
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,810
loop of insulin delivery and started a

75
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,269
movement and a community this community

76
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,519
it has now more than 500 contributors on

77
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,260
github it has a thousand members on on

78
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,640
the discussion channel on your own

79
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,289
guitar many more on that database CGM in

80
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,500
the cloud and even more in

81
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,990
Facebook group and the regional Facebook

82
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:34,190
groups or other groups or meetups so it

83
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,850
will maybe that I owe my life to this

84
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:44,900
community in the last six months since I

85
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,270
started looping I learned more about

86
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,000
type 1 diabetes they learned in that 13

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,390
years before much more and I'm still

88
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,050
alive

89
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,480
thanks to all the people in the we're

90
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,430
not waiting community so please think

91
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,590
about contributing to a community

92
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,360
yourself it saves lives

93
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,610
if you don't feel self-confident enough

94
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,680
to contributing code contribute in

95
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,290
documentation participate in a meet-up

96
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,840
or star 1 discuss with people and share

97
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,050
your knowledge spread your developer

98
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,080
love plays thank you

99
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,810
