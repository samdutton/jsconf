00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,380

my name is Dan beam I just wanted to put

2
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,720
out there pre-eminently I'm sorry for

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,060
all the pooping earlier I didn't mean

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,550
anything by it if you want to come and

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,190
poopin me feel free my tour will be open

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,510
to anybody that feels like they want

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,430
retribution come on over again I'm sorry

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,690
but uh on to my presentation this is a

9
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,690
how to be a player on the internet the

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,540
making of a Yahoo's universal j/s media

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,850
player and as you can tell by the purple

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,560
and from yahoo so what what is Yahoo

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,530
media player well obviously it's

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,480
Universal j/s media player so I thought

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,600
it best explained in jas with the

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,449
appending of one script your page goes

17
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,479
from cool to awesome I find the code

18
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,700
example pretty self-explanatory so I

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,560
wanted to show you guys real quick a

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,390
demonstration of the actual product

21
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,610
because i'm pretty sure i have a few of

22
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,920
you that have never seen it so here's a

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,410
quick demo of what it does and what it

24
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,270
can do for you I promise I'll get into

25
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,550
more engineering stuff real soon so this

26
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,819
is a band we allow independent blog

27
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:36,670
owners and publishers mainly like bands

28
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,899
and stuff to to use our player so they

29
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:42,940
throw the one script tag and they'll get

30
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,069
an experience similar to something like

31
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:47,890
this as a user when I scroll down the

32
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,649
page I notice a play button next to this

33
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,850
particular link it will automatically

34
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,140
play the video right in context while I

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,869
continue to read so I can see this is a

36
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,149
great love song still verses in other

37
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:06,490
embeds it's it's a little harder to read

38
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,569
because if you wanted to continue

39
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,220
reading the video would also move

40
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,990
there's a lot of other reasons too but

41
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:16,090
we also play a audio as well which also

42
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,670
allows you to continue reading and

43
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,260
doesn't really wreck your experience if

44
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,099
I want to find this audio on my page all

45
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:26,049
I have to simply do is click this

46
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,209
handy-dandy scroll to button so these

47
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,590
are just a couple of the features that

48
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,610
we have

49
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,030
and so let's get into now what you as a

50
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,490
developer can do to customize an

51
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,260
experience like this if you're not quite

52
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,300
satisfied with what this does or if you

53
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,520
just want to make something on your own

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,580
and you know why because we love

55
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,250
developers so our API has a lot of

56
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,010
public methods it's all on one global

57
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,750
yahoo dot media player in the style of

58
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,870
Yui to when this was originally created

59
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,400
you can also set global environment

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,760
variables that control auto-playing

61
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,820
album are all kinds of cool stuff so

62
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,080
this allows you to create custom

63
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,760
experiences so say for instance I didn't

64
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,050
want the same experience that's just

65
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,470
being able to play in line in the page I

66
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,510
could also do something kind of like

67
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,130
this so i made this as a real quick hat

68
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,180
it all it does is it pulls the top five

69
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,030
hits off of GData API for YouTube so I'm

70
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,790
going to look up a keyboard cat and all

71
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,890
it does is it plays let me see if I can

72
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:41,290
actually get audio working so it will

73
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,989
display the first five of the top hits

74
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,870
on YouTube for about five seconds each

75
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,730
and this is using this is using our API

76
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,230
to be able to just have a more custom

77
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,500
experience it's real simple code it's

78
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,310
not not a lot add some content add

79
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,430
tracks just using a convenient Dom node

80
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,080
API you just have to add the container

81
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,810
it parses all the links for you and then

82
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,610
you play and send an interval to

83
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,910
continue going another level of

84
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,549
customization would be skinning we want

85
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:16,600
you to be able to skin and hover you

86
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,250
want this is how Yahoo search made

87
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,080
theirs look it's pretty easy to scan

88
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,549
it's going to be a lot easier in the

89
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,169
next super-secret awesome cool version

90
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,260
and there will also be a preset theme

91
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,740
roller and chooser real soon so our

92
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,200
goals our goals as yahoo media player

93
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,270
would be like i mentioned easy to

94
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,200
install one script should rule them all

95
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,450
you should be able to take your page

96
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,310
from a page to a playlist like i

97
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,150
mentioned you

98
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,010
you can be able to just add in line pay

99
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,380
in line play buttons easily and you

100
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,090
should be able to mix audio and video

101
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,290
because that adds a really cool

102
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,820
experience and just makes overall like a

103
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,880
dry page of text into a much richer

104
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,950
experience for all your users keeps them

105
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,450
on the site longer makes you more money

106
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,350
so like I mentioned we want to work on

107
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,500
any page in any browser device with any

108
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,710
media or service and let's get into how

109
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,400
we actually do that yeah so we support

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,740
every browser you can think of except

111
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,640
iceweasel and and kind of opera because

112
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,830
of Yui is grated browser support we do

113
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,510
support it but we're not really required

114
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,880
to so the first way we go about actually

115
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,220
supporting a lot of browsers and a lot

116
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,690
of formats oh I should mention the

117
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,040
format's we play a lot of stuff mp3 WMA

118
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,110
m4a flv youtube yahoo movies a lot of

119
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,540
stuff so on the first thing we do is we

120
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,190
have a clear separation we lose couple

121
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,230
all of our stuff we have a ton of code

122
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,870
without some type of organization you

123
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,660
would be totally lost so one thing we

124
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,790
make a heavy use of is the adapter

125
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,170
pattern which works super well for

126
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,210
engines if you'll notice here this is

127
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,960
our inheritance kind of tree we have

128
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,760
just a base engine which does event

129
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,310
publishing and subscription which goes

130
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,280
down more specifically to engine in

131
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,620
audio and video engines and has all the

132
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,350
engines we currently support with the

133
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,050
future ones we plan to using html5 audio

134
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,220
and video it should be coming soon and

135
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,560
we also allow this adapter pattern by

136
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,150
the way it allows you to just create a

137
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,640
common API right each each engine will

138
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,530
have something like play pause next stop

139
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,500
stuff like that real easy but we can

140
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,660
tame those quirks and there's a ton of

141
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,690
quirks media engines suck they are

142
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,760
they're not great so we contain those

143
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,530
quirks at any level including one

144
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,360
specifically for a certain engine or the

145
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,220
entire way up the chain so another cool

146
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,260
thing that a flexible architecture does

147
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,150
for you and this adapter pattern Nimrod

148
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,250
is a fellow developer smart dude not a

149
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:57,129
Nimrod anyways um he we we use graceful

150
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,409
back in a sense that if you happen to be

151
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,929
on something like Windows without flash

152
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:03,999
well know instantly that we can go to

153
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:05,469
Windows Media Player QuickTime

154
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:07,629
relatively easily based on the fact that

155
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:09,159
we know windows media player is better

156
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:11,289
for your particular less same with OSX

157
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:12,580
we can go to quicktime and other things

158
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,439
like that we have a large complicated

159
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,869
fallback chain we use any possible way

160
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,939
to play the media that we can get

161
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,919
basically and like i said many more

162
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:24,099
engines come another cool feature that

163
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:26,589
we have is a the ability to kind of just

164
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:28,239
link to movies and then we will

165
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,309
automatically find a trailer for you

166
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:32,830
using YQL to hit yahoo movies and then

167
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,389
if that doesn't happen to have a trailer

168
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,459
for that movie we will go back to 2g

169
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,439
data with youtube and we basically just

170
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,809
take care of all the the glue code and

171
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:43,449
the effort it takes to require or to

172
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,439
find the trailer you want so but enough

173
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,039
about us on to you how do we peacefully

174
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,509
coexist with your page unless your pages

175
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,949
on gopher so for CSS we we heavily

176
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,959
namespace everything we've come into

177
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,199
issues before but so we namespace all of

178
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,079
our classes we we use no IDs as their

179
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,269
global and we do a lot of interesting

180
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:12,490
things we filter chain which is just

181
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,309
like glorified search and replace on Yui

182
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:18,309
3 widget CSS at Build time just changing

183
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:21,309
it and adding our own CSS prefix we also

184
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:23,619
do a lot of contextual CSS resetting

185
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:26,709
which is really cool so yeah just our

186
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,019
player can be able to be reset similarly

187
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:30,279
the way that you would be able to reset

188
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,500
an entire HTML page but just

189
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,539
contextually within ours to not affect

190
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,159
you as well as we do a little more

191
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,019
aggressive resets to be able to override

192
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,199
cool myspace hacks like cursor crosshair

193
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:42,639
and all that other fun stuff while

194
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,839
you're mousing in our player we also

195
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,029
coexist peacefully or attempt to with

196
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,699
javascript as well we have minimal

197
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,500
included dependencies we will never

198
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,750
conflict with the library or any of your

199
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,069
Global's or natives on the page we we

200
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:02,199
also use an async loader will get that

201
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,959
to that insect we use one URL you have

202
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,819
the same URL forever you always

203
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,709
constantly get our updated versions we

204
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:09,769
push out versions

205
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,019
a lot you get this you'll always get the

206
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,249
latest version as long as you're using

207
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:15,170
our loader we host the entire thing

208
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,759
ourselves you don't have to pay a cent

209
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,119
for bandwidth the full player is cash

210
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,100
forever regardless of which page you

211
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,110
happen to load it on whether it's you

212
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,929
know Yahoo movie page or a blog you

213
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:31,009
happen to see for an artist yeah we only

214
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:33,319
introduced one semi global if you didn't

215
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:36,439
already have yahoo has one so let's get

216
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:40,429
on to performance so obviously in

217
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,860
performance when it comes HTTP requests

218
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,230
less is more we have an interesting hack

219
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,410
we've done where we build CSS into our

220
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,290
JavaScript we minify it with Yui

221
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,839
compressor and we build it into the

222
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,790
JavaScript just in a string literal and

223
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,879
inject it after we're on the page itself

224
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,920
so that pipelines all the HTTP

225
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,989
connections for CSS required into one

226
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:06,199
javascript file we do this at Build time

227
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:08,059
with aunt and aunt templates it's real

228
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:10,850
cool and then we also use a heavily use

229
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,429
CSS spriting we only have one image that

230
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:16,819
I think that that is from us it's a

231
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:19,399
large bright for all the UI of all the

232
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,350
player it's pretty cool and right now

233
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,480
we're investigating in lining data your

234
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,850
eyes into the CSS for the sprite as well

235
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,100
as any type of engines code that we need

236
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,079
in lining that into the script as well

237
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,809
for browsers that support it IE 8 and

238
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,459
above and everything else not

239
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:40,160
surprisingly so more on performance we

240
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,619
do dham caching and delegation pretty de

241
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:45,259
facto standard these days we only query

242
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:48,079
your Dom once and we do it relatively

243
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,420
after we found the containers we cash

244
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,910
every reference we delegate all of our

245
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,470
events to make sure that you don't have

246
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,179
a lot of memory blow from handlers as

247
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:58,369
well as we catch any extraneous events

248
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:59,749
that we don't want propagating up to

249
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:02,569
your page all this is so we can coexist

250
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:04,429
did not affect the performance of your

251
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:05,720
page because that's obviously something

252
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,059
we want to consider and last like I

253
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:09,799
mentioned a little bit async laziness

254
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,899
this is for Ryan of Yui law cats we are

255
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,850
non-blocking like I mentioned the only

256
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,149
part that blocks on your page is a small

257
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:21,860
loader that decides whether or not to

258
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,370
inject itself if

259
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,040
mine's media links we lazy load anything

260
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,250
we can like for instance a YouTube

261
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,310
player like I showed you we lazy load

262
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,350
all the metadata for all the items if we

263
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,510
need to get more we do it only when you

264
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,770
play the items you're not paying

265
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,820
anything for all that and then we do a

266
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,920
bit more cool stuff with YQL you've

267
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,420
heard it mentioned a couple times yahoo

268
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,180
query language we do we do server-side

269
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,830
processing with javascript which is

270
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,500
which is pretty sweet j/s conf I know

271
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,370
you care so we do server-side JavaScript

272
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,160
with rhino and and execute which which

273
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,920
you allows you to do any processing

274
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,270
manipulation and only send back just the

275
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,670
small subset of data that you need so I

276
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,010
mean a lot of api's expose a lot of data

277
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,050
if you ever looked at any of Google or

278
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,820
Yahoo api's they have a ton of stuff you

279
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,589
usually only need a couple things send

280
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:15,750
only what you need over the wire cash it

281
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,800
intelligently with yql and and also had

282
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,870
some really cool aspects of access

283
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,930
control when you have an API key with

284
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,380
YQL you're able to actually create three

285
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,700
multiple keys that would be able to

286
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,830
allow users to execute read or write

287
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,690
your table this is really useful when

288
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,160
you're a client-side widget because

289
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,230
there's basically no security when

290
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,910
you're completely on the client side so

291
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,150
this allows us to hide API keys hostname

292
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,760
information all that fun stuff and only

293
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,010
expose that executes key to everyone

294
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,770
that uses the plugin so now to the

295
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,540
future I've mentioned a couple times you

296
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,640
know we have some future plans and the

297
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,170
one that I've been working on for a

298
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,610
little while and it's due to come out

299
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,430
the soonest is the new UI it's about as

300
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,680
sexy as mr. Hasselhoff here maybe even

301
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,430
more but it is sexier faster more

302
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,050
skinnable I'm sorry if you have to look

303
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,459
away okay but that's it that's a mock

304
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,110
right there a little different looking

305
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,520
from our previous Rev as you can tell

306
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,529
it's a lot sleeker this is uh this

307
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,660
happens to be on a yahoo movie blog that

308
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,230
we're already injected in so looks

309
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,430
pretty sweet it's gonna have a lot more

310
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,010
features come talk to me afterwards if

311
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,300
you're interested in hearing about them

312
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,190
and sorry I didn't mean to do that just

313
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,059
want to check my spot

314
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:41,769
what up I did not but I can if you want

315
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,629
so like I said we're going to add more

316
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,970
engines like audio and video because

317
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,089
this allows a lot more things for us any

318
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,040
codecs that we didn't previously support

319
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,379
and anything that we we wouldn't be able

320
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,689
to play easily with uh with that with

321
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,279
more engines you can just do natively in

322
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,199
the browser that's really cool we're

323
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,819
kind of just waiting for it to stabilize

324
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:03,709
out just a tiny bit more and then we're

325
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,149
going to drop that into our flexible

326
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,459
architecture like i mentioned we're

327
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:09,439
really interested in supporting mobile

328
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:12,439
and tablet we kind of accidentally work

329
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:15,639
on android already because of the the

330
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,569
headless Swift that i mentioned earlier

331
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:19,699
that plays some of the audio but the

332
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:21,019
rest we've been getting a lot of

333
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:23,389
requests for iOS devices and we're going

334
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:24,470
to we're planning on supporting that

335
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,970
really soon so you'll be able to

336
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,290
literally work on almost anything and

337
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,819
then we're also playing on adding more

338
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:34,329
video and audio services and publishers

339
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:38,689
if you have recommendations were come

340
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:39,860
talk to me afterwards there we have a

341
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,449
tech group or you can have my email just

342
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:43,579
let us know we're kind of categorizing

343
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,589
we have quite a few ideas we just want

344
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:47,540
to prioritize which ones and we're

345
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,160
adding a social features say you you

346
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,519
thought that the the keyboard cat video

347
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,720
is awesome and you did think that

348
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,279
actually some of your friends don't

349
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,410
happen to know about it you'd be able to

350
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,779
share it or tweet about it something

351
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,959
like that right from the player so we're

352
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,059
integrating those aspects real soon too

353
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:07,999
and much much more there's the sales

354
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:11,019
pitch so thank you again for listening

355
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,970
my name is Dan I hope Batman doesn't

356
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,639
come arrest me right now so and then

357
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,189
here's credits for all those photos
