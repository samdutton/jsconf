00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:46,060

everybody thank you any questions I'll

2
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,780
be available later um my name is John

3
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,829
Han I work for a company called pivotal

4
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,100
you probably know us for some product or

5
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,989
some service or some division of us

6
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:01,570
somewhere I am the resident JavaScript

7
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,730
barbarian figure out what that means on

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,780
your own actually I work for pivotal

9
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,510
frameworks in runtimes department one of

10
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,909
the many departments and these are some

11
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,800
of the projects that we work on within

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,330
the frameworks and runtimes department

13
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,409
I'm very proud of these all open source

14
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,870
lots of other ones private source

15
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,979
private products and whatnot and

16
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:26,470
specifically what I work on a day-to-day

17
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,380
basis is the couch ojs toolkit so you

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,330
may have encountered one of these in

19
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,680
your travels or in your programming

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,610
endeavors so but anyways I'm not here to

21
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,110
talk about any of that stuff i'm here to

22
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,430
talk about javascript of course because

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,170
javascript is awesome and that's why

24
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,570
we're all here and actually javascript

25
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,360
has become incredibly sophisticated I'm

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,250
we all know that's why we're here today

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,810
you know we're doing all sorts of crazy

28
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,340
things that a couple years ago nobody

29
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,570
thought we were going to be doing you

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,880
know we're doing aop we do dependency

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,070
inversion inversion of control we don't

32
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,100
have all sorts of crazy architectures

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,439
we're doing things with other languages

34
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,140
trance piling to them integrating with

35
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,330
things like you know obviously if it's a

36
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,590
multi language environment in the

37
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,539
browser we got HTML CSS all this stuff

38
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,209
we've got package managers now you know

39
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,400
we got minim fires optimizers bill

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,439
you know which really was a WTF for me

41
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:23,379
but anyways with this sophistication you

42
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,030
know comes more complexity and of course

43
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,739
more machinery you got to set up all

44
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:27,909
this stuff you've got to configure all

45
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:29,319
this stuff and when you can figure all

46
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,579
this stuff now you've got a maintenance

47
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:33,459
task you've got a whole new sub project

48
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,459
just to have a javascript-based project

49
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:40,090
and this is what I mean when I realized

50
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,640
that that the good old days are gone and

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,730
we can't just you know add a script tag

52
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,730
to a minimal HTML file you know and now

53
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,430
we have to actually you know build stuff

54
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,019
in order to have an application that was

55
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,760
a big WTF so what happened to the good

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,930
old days what happened when we could

57
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,760
just do this we could just add a script

58
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,939
tag maybe a stylesheet just get started

59
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,139
coding you know if you want to do a

60
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,790
quick prototype you know this is what

61
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,590
you did you just took you just quickly

62
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,200
create an HTML page created a JavaScript

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,730
page linked them together and then just

64
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,790
started coding right so now if you

65
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,590
actually want to do that in order to do

66
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,909
that you kind of have to write crappy

67
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:17,500
code that's my opinion of course you

68
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,959
know but but if you really wanted to

69
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,910
prototype something and you want to do

70
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,620
it in an architectural e sound way you

71
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,349
want to do it with your favorite

72
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,609
framework or you would just want to

73
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:29,620
incorporate some you know of the the

74
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,599
current best practices you can't just

75
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,940
get started like that anymore so in

76
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,230
order to do it the right way you either

77
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,180
have to have lots of boilerplate lots of

78
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,909
configuration lots of machinery and and

79
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:42,159
it's just too much work in general and

80
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,169
in my day job you know we were we were

81
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,639
encountering countering this problem

82
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,280
trying to create tutorials one part of

83
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,989
my part of my job description is to

84
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,090
create tutorials so that the job of

85
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,409
folks out there can learn how to use

86
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:55,419
JavaScript and that's as an impossible

87
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:57,310
task on its own but then on top of that

88
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,799
if you have to you know you have to

89
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,690
explain to them okay first you have to

90
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,609
set up your your grunt file your gulp

91
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,470
file and then oh yeah if you want to use

92
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,569
AMD you know I had set up AMD config and

93
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,069
stuff it's just it's just way too much

94
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,040
stuff you can't you can't quickly you

95
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,540
know you can't get someone to the meat

96
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,220
of the problem quick enough now because

97
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,699
configuration is too too complex so

98
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,500
here's just a quick example this is an

99
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,030
actual project that I was asked to

100
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,450
consult for they started out with a 500

101
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,909
line grunt file and we said whoa whoa

102
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:29,080
whoa this is way too

103
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,030
much you guys have to be doing something

104
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,189
wrong right so we went in there and we

105
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,169
looked at first thing we said ah you

106
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:36,460
know you guys need to choose a module

107
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,490
system all this global stuff you know

108
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,389
number one you shouldn't be using

109
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,729
Global's anymore and B this is going to

110
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:44,680
cut out so much your grunt file and only

111
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,939
cut out a hundred lines of the grunt

112
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:48,069
file and then of course they ended up

113
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,960
having to have an AMD config file which

114
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,120
was 70 lines of code so so here's the

115
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,810
grunt file right here yeah so this is

116
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,000
this is a grub file and this is all you

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,409
know they did the research this is the

118
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,210
best practices stuff you know their mana

119
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,919
fiying all the things you know that

120
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,840
they're they're using less and

121
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,750
preprocessing it you know here's their

122
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,120
you know main DJ s so that they can they

123
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,690
can have AMD modules in the browser and

124
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,699
then there can you know the testing

125
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:16,990
config you know then they had to have

126
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,580
testing the fig and this is actually the

127
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,379
pared-down testing config that they had

128
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:26,349
so so can we simplify this mess and my

129
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:29,229
answer is yes we need to and if you've

130
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,449
been coding in java recently I know if

131
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:33,400
anybody has but you know this this code

132
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,349
that I'm showing up here reminds me a

133
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:38,500
lot of you know maven code or XML files

134
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,449
all the stuff that you used to have to

135
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,580
do in Java and I say used to because

136
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,469
this is a new projects out there one of

137
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,930
them from pivotal spring boot which

138
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,779
eliminates all of it so you basically

139
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:52,240
have no more XML no more you know

140
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,009
configuration you just get started and

141
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,860
so you know my boss has come to me and

142
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,110
say what the hell why do we have to do

143
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,120
this stuff in JavaScript still so so now

144
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,210
my job is to to try to eliminate all

145
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,069
this configuration mess that we have to

146
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,219
do in javascript so that's where rave

147
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:12,430
comes in so what is rave I'll tell you

148
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,110
right now it's not a new framework

149
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,360
you're not a rave global you're going to

150
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,190
code to you don't have to require rave

151
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,930
in your code actually we're not going to

152
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,089
touch your code at all so it's not

153
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,919
another loader it's not not an AMD

154
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,990
loader but it does have a loader built

155
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,210
in actually it has an es6 style loader

156
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,779
and it uses a shim built by guy bedford

157
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:33,490
who's here somewhere so pat him on the

158
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,349
back next time you see them he's doing

159
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,839
an excellent job on an es6 loader shim

160
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,639
so that you it's built for the future

161
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,370
you can load things like AMD you can

162
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,270
load common j

163
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,280
pretty soon you'll be able to load es6

164
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,840
and rave and you can load other things

165
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,070
to a lot of things you're used to

166
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,140
loading if you're using AMD now you can

167
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,800
load CSS text Jason whatever but

168
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,850
unfortunately it's not ready for

169
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,290
production yet you know you can play

170
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,380
with it now and we have again probably

171
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,150
about a third of the way to where we

172
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,830
want to be and at about two thirds of

173
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,300
the way we're going to say yes this is

174
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,280
ready for you to use so probably about

175
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,830
another four to six weeks I'm going to

176
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,480
try to get it in less than that but

177
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,770
let's see and we want your feedback

178
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,390
that's why I'm here today I want

179
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,800
feedback I want you guys to come tell me

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,290
and say this sucks you know this is not

181
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,150
the way we want to do things and and

182
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,710
we're going to try to accommodate you

183
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,540
and a comment people that maybe love it

184
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,860
so okay so what are we trying to do and

185
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,800
three bullets provide a default you know

186
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,530
instantly out-of-the-box configuration

187
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,450
you install rave bag you've got

188
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,800
something to run you've got a nap it's a

189
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,510
simple app it just it's basically a

190
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,210
hello world app but you've got something

191
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,220
and you can just immediately start start

192
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,270
doing something make it easy then to get

193
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,350
sophisticated you know start doing

194
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,810
things like the advanced testing install

195
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,540
your favorite favorite framework start

196
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,070
doing trance piling and that kind of

197
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,320
stuff makes it brain dead easy to start

198
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,150
doing that and then make it easy to

199
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,740
assert your own opinion again we don't

200
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,350
want to you know we have to impose some

201
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,360
opinion but we want that to be extremely

202
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,660
minimal so one of the ways to get a

203
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,020
default you know runnable configuration

204
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,550
is through something called a rave

205
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,140
starter and basically it's just a repo

206
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,540
on github you just go and you you

207
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,180
download it and you just you know follow

208
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,770
the instructions it's very simple

209
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,600
instructions just then launch a favorite

210
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,880
browser open up a favor editor ready and

211
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,440
you get started but there's also a way

212
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,030
to start from scratch and if I have some

213
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,710
time i'm going to show you both methods

214
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,420
actually how to start from scratch just

215
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,690
by typing in npm in it or bower in it

216
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,380
and starting from there so the way this

217
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,180
works the reason is no build step is

218
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,220
because the runtime by default is

219
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,810
responsive to the environment and

220
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,760
actually auto you know auto configs

221
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,460
based off things that can find through

222
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,440
the browser and so you get your in this

223
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,139
mode and if you used to require jsam

224
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,329
you just write code reload you know

225
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:01,129
repeat you know write some code reload

226
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,600
rights Cove reload there's no build

227
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,480
steps in the default AMD configuration

228
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,639
so we've reproduced that but in a much

229
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,970
more sophisticated way so that if you

230
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,319
want to get sophisticated we want it to

231
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,259
be a one-liner very easy to move over to

232
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:18,109
now you're building and then you know of

233
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:19,999
course when you're building now you've

234
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,889
got file Watchers you've got pre

235
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,899
processes you get transpires you've got

236
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,419
you've got you know bundlers and

237
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,040
builders and all the sophisticated stuff

238
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,839
and that comes with source maps and all

239
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,149
this all these things that could go

240
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:34,970
wrong so so we want it easy to go back

241
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,910
again and and and you'll be able to go

242
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,160
back and forth and back and forth into

243
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,499
whatever mode you want to and still zero

244
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,290
configuration and then of course tests

245
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,910
we want it to be brain dead easy to

246
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,019
start test we're not going to write your

247
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:51,919
tests for you yet but but obviously you

248
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,089
know testing its got to be an important

249
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,970
part of the strategy so when you want to

250
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,079
assert your opinion of course we're not

251
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,220
going to tell you what to write one like

252
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,389
we're not going to write your app code

253
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,459
for you that's up to you but if you

254
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:03,199
decide that you want to use angular we

255
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:05,480
want you to be able to just bang one

256
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,699
line you're starting to use angular if

257
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:09,350
you want to do something crazy like this

258
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,029
I don't know if something like this

259
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:12,649
exists but you want to use knockout and

260
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:13,879
backbone together I don't know if that

261
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,980
could even happen but if you wanted to

262
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,600
we wanted to make possible for someone

263
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,029
out there to create what we're calling a

264
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:22,100
rave integration package to allow

265
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,169
someone who's figured out how to make it

266
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:26,239
work to just push that out onto the web

267
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,919
and then you can pull that down and use

268
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,779
it so then if you want to add other

269
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,329
capabilities like browser capabilities

270
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,029
you want to start using web components

271
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,529
or you want to you know start loading

272
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:38,600
using the loader to load things that

273
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,610
besides just modules you can do that as

274
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,139
well and of course we want this to work

275
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:45,799
in multiple environments so spring and

276
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,169
rails are the ones that internally we

277
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:51,799
need to get working so okay so how can

278
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,959
this possibly work and the answer is to

279
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,399
metadata so we're going to by default if

280
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,989
you install a starter we're going to

281
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:02,029
provide a minimal amount of metadata for

282
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,259
you're ready and this metadata is going

283
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:06,199
to be in bar Jason or package Jason and

284
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,179
then if you knew it or not you're

285
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:10,399
already generating metadata so for

286
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:10,940
instance every

287
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,010
I mean you you do a bower install you

288
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,440
pulled some more data metadata down with

289
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,180
that package or anytime you do NPM

290
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,860
install you're pulling down additional

291
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,140
metadata and all I have to do is include

292
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,250
the dash dash save if I everybody look

293
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,800
at the dash dash safe okay do we see the

294
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,570
dashed a safe if as long as you that

295
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,280
you've pulled the metadata in a way

296
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,830
that's now discoverable and it's

297
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,900
discoverable without searching your file

298
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,480
system so that's very important for you

299
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,640
know for rave to be able to autodiscover

300
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,220
you know that the referred to be

301
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,190
responsive to the environment and then

302
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,110
as I mentioned before people be able to

303
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,850
create these integration packets so you

304
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,100
could just do Bower install or NPM

305
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,500
install my favorite integration package

306
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,060
that pulls this this and this together

307
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,040
and install it and that comes with

308
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,980
additional metadata and actually there's

309
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,110
an opportunity to pull an additional

310
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:09,020
glue code as well at that point so other

311
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,460
wave extensions we actually have a

312
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,930
number of extensions out there already

313
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,210
we've got 12 or 14 extensions out on on

314
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,030
NPM and Bauer at the moment so you know

315
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,010
of course you'd be able to you know

316
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,500
install some crazy integration package

317
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,740
we have we have a rave angular package

318
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,250
out there already we've got we actually

319
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,530
started working on a polymer package and

320
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,520
actually most of the ones on the screen

321
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,450
don't exist yet but they will soon so

322
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,640
then you know what's the easiest way to

323
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,340
allow a developer what is the one liner

324
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,140
that someone needs to type in order to

325
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,580
make this work so we're thinking okay so

326
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,530
we could create a rave CLI and that's

327
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,780
that's an interesting idea the rave CLI

328
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,990
we can remove the guesswork we can we

329
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,610
can do a lot of intelligent things

330
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,730
because right now you know if if you're

331
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,130
mixing NPM and Bauer which is possible

332
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,330
with rave you know you can get yourself

333
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,750
with these really nasty situations so

334
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,839
we're thinking about a rave CLI and you

335
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,220
know that's one way to do it but we also

336
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,870
at the same time we you know we don't

337
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,190
want to get in your way we don't want

338
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,930
you to have yet another CLI if you don't

339
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,970
want it so anything we do will also be

340
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,190
possible with the command lines are used

341
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,990
to NPM gulp grunt

342
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,550
and Bauer okay so this is the part where

343
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,040
I'm going to attempt to do a little bit

344
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,709
of coding and show you what this is like

345
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:47,220
okay and my cheat sheet has disappeared

346
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:55,700
okay

347
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:01,740
okay all right so just to try and

348
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,350
illustrate how simple this is supposed

349
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,530
to be can everybody see that fine that

350
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,120
the terminal window do I need to update

351
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,760
how's that is that good all right so I'm

352
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,410
going to make a directory and I'm going

353
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:26,490
to CD into it okay so this is this is

354
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,050
the bootstrap case where you're just

355
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,670
going to start from scratch so I'm just

356
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,760
going to type npm in it and I'm going to

357
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,030
accept just about all of this so what

358
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,190
was happened now I've created a package

359
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,530
Jason simple enough okay so I've already

360
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,970
generated some metadata they're just

361
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,740
from doing NPM in it so what I'm going

362
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,360
to do now is I'm going to install rave

363
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,710
of course that's i'm going to do and cho

364
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,890
not bad everybody stopped checking text

365
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,750
messages okay all right and for fun i'm

366
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,020
going to install an additional rave

367
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,480
extension that allows you to load text

368
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,240
through the module loader all right and

369
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,990
let's see okay so I'm just opening up my

370
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,350
favorite editor and you can see that you

371
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,210
know I've generated some metadata here

372
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,940
rave and rave load text are now in here

373
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,130
and neither these are now discoverable

374
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:39,240
by rave okay and i'm going to quickly

375
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:46,320
create an index dot HTML and i'm going

376
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,990
to give it a one-liner ok so that's it

377
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:57,360
and i'm going to create a main bjs if

378
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,640
you noticed very quickly i typed in main

379
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,340
DJ s when i was doing NP in it and asked

380
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,250
me what the name of the main entry point

381
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,320
would be so i'm creating something there

382
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,090
and now if I I am just going to serve

383
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,290
this folder under port 8080 too that's

384
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:24,820
what I'm going to do

385
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:31,400
and and it did not work of course all

386
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,540
right let me just see what's going on

387
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,020
here I have a feeling that chrome is

388
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:47,960
lying to me here let's try this 83 I'm

389
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:54,350
used to yes I'm used to an editor that I

390
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,390
lied this is not my favorite editor I'm

391
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:01,200
used to an editor that auto-saves okay

392
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,150
all right so console and yes we have a

393
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,339
yay ignore those four fours for now i'll

394
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,810
show you how to get rid of those okay

395
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:13,850
alright so not that interesting but

396
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,200
that's that's the startup experience

397
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,180
i'll show you a more sophisticated

398
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:25,339
application let's see okay so and let's

399
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:28,040
see i am going to attempt to pull

400
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,870
something down as tar file here let's

401
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,640
see how this goes

402
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:42,480
and it worked all right so I'm going to

403
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:53,100
stall a start a package here okay so if

404
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,750
you're watching this is installing a few

405
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,470
things I installed a rave aguilar

406
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,240
starter package so and if we look here

407
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,430
you can see that we've installed couple

408
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,800
things our angular and rave load Jason

409
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,770
but you can also see that we've got some

410
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,510
other things that transitively got

411
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,640
installed and we've got a minimal index

412
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,300
dot HTML here and the minimal boot j/s

413
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,370
file which is just a boot loader and

414
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,560
minimal main which is this is a common

415
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,570
J's formatted file that is actually

416
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,260
bootstrapping angular and if I come over

417
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:43,680
to the browser here and let's see do

418
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,020
this on port 8080 to the reason I'm

419
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,520
using different ports is because I had

420
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,300
some problems with with chrome caching

421
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,750
aggressively and or my web server ID and

422
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:13,750
figured out which one it is okay

423
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,460
let's try this one

424
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,510
here we go okay so now we have an

425
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:29,030
angular application running and you're

426
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,470
going to switch over to one more

427
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,820
application here and this application is

428
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,490
definitely more sophisticated than the

429
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,030
other ones it's currently running on

430
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,190
port 8080 one so it's right here it's

431
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,470
just simple to do the application I can

432
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,890
add some to do's it's communicating with

433
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,470
over web sockets to another port on on

434
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,570
this machine but let's take a look at it

435
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,700
and there's an index dot HTML here and

436
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,669
let's say you know I've got a you know

437
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:02,990
just quickly look here it's just it's

438
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,809
just a very simple MVC type application

439
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,600
but let's say I decide that I want to

440
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,190
incorporate CSS into my build process so

441
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,140
I'm going to stop using link elements

442
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,520
and instead I'm going to pull that in

443
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,159
through through my build and in and

444
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:21,080
build bundle that actually into the

445
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,440
JavaScript so I can do that but because

446
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,059
I've installed this rave load CSS rave

447
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:32,120
extension and now I can do things like

448
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,780
require my CSS a zipper or module and so

449
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,750
I just just switched over to that let's

450
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,980
see remember to save again and I reload

451
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,909
over here and so now take a look at the

452
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,440
elements here and you see that this is

453
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,179
commented out but we still have the CSS

454
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:54,230
because the CSS get injected at runtime

455
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,850
and and this all gets so the CSS would

456
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,440
actually get bundled into the javascript

457
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,970
in this case and so that's just an

458
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,919
example of one way that you can extend

459
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,720
the loader extend the capabilities just

460
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,230
by installing a package so

461
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,280
so basically it's right here because

462
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,080
because I installed it and I did Bower

463
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,059
install dash dash save it's available

464
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,100
there and and and rave can discover and

465
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:29,820
just know what to do with it okay so so

466
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,610
where is rave today right now we're able

467
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,559
to load Bauer look use Bower and mpm to

468
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,420
pull down packages we're able to load

469
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,780
AMD style or node style you know common

470
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,700
Jas packages we can we can load txt

471
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,870
files through the loader CSS Jason we've

472
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,300
got a whole suite of Cujo j/s extensions

473
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,540
out there and we're very close to having

474
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,570
the no configuration build story working

475
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,190
as well I said probably about four to

476
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,820
six weeks and that will be done I'm also

477
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,640
coming very soon es6 module syntax be

478
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,190
able to write you know in a very clean

479
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:15,030
import export type module syntax it's

480
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,679
probably still early because you know

481
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,290
the until browsers have implemented that

482
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,590
it's subject to change but will be a

483
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,390
will be offering it anyways for you dare

484
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,420
devils and then you know we're working

485
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,179
on some other things like angular and

486
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:31,230
integration even deeper that's actually

487
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,760
we are actually actually have that

488
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,809
started to so so I'm going to cut it off

489
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:39,059
there I've got plenty more to show you

490
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,860
guys if anybody's interested come see me

491
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,210
I can I can definitely show you some

492
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,910
more stuff and any questions right now I

493
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,440
think we have a time for a question or

494
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,990
two if anybody has question anyone yes

495
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,269
sorry

496
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,470
yes it will integrate integrate with

497
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,890
grails and/or spring how that works how

498
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,419
much is that that is in rave and how

499
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:06,980
much that of that goes into Grails and

500
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,950
spring I'm not obviously okay so so so

501
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,799
it's a good question you know like

502
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,270
Grails people aren't going to want to

503
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,350
they're not going to understand why do I

504
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,730
have to go install node in order to

505
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,830
build an app right so so that's a choice

506
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,000
and we've been thinking about about that

507
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,029
a lot actually and it's it becomes more

508
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:30,679
obvious when you think of the front end

509
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:33,500
as a separate application right but

510
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,899
that's why I'm also saying that you know

511
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:38,029
we also might incorporate some of that

512
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:39,950
into the the spring and the Grail side

513
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,919
as well so what for spring web jars came

514
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,390
up but the way the web jars is

515
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,360
implemented it can't work with this

516
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,179
sophisticated level of stuff was really

517
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,159
meant for for browser Global's and

518
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,080
there's some real nasty hacks and

519
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,470
therefore require jas but we're also

520
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,120
thinking about talking to them to see if

521
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:09,599
they can overhaul web jars but

522
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:13,060
right

523
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,740
right so use Grails instead of node and

524
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,919
so yeah definitely interested in that

525
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:21,470
that's that it feels like a larger task

526
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,789
right now because like I said we want to

527
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:24,649
leverage gulp and grunt first and used

528
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:26,299
to use the tools that JavaScript

529
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,340
developers are using instead of just you

530
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,169
know instead of what Grails guys are

531
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,809
using so but but definitely we've been

532
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,669
talking about it a lot and so we do want

533
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:35,809
to do it it's just not going to be the
