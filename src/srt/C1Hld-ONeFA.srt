1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:32,510

thank you thank you and welcome

2
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,440
and when I was five items I scientists

3
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,550
in Switzerland British scientists put

4
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,309
online the World Wide Web I don't think

5
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:51,489
it made the headlines anymore but 25th

6
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:55,570
birthday this one and it's pretty

7
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,489
amazing what happened in last 25 years

8
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:02,770
with it right we can do things like live

9
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,629
in Vancouver and work for a company in

10
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,800
Chicago we can you know meet in Iceland

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,280
at a conference with people from all

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,920
over the world and most important of all

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,110
we can look at cute cat videos all times

14
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,030
of the day so that was a pretty big

15
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,950
change and that's kind of symbol of how

16
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,720
I feel about machine learning I'd like

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,130
to use the much cooler sounding

18
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,570
intelligence or AI and yeah it's kind of

19
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,810
like a like the Internet it's a general

20
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,200
purpose technology we had two talks

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,390
already that talked about using AI to

22
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,689
generate art Google is using it to drive

23
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,869
cars and I'm going to talk about using

24
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:58,210
it to do natural language processing the

25
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,159
cool thing about the web browser is that

26
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,680
Google and Mozilla actually offering us

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,070
an API maybe you've seen yesterday to do

28
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,860
speech speech recognition but to make

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,100
sense of that language is a little

30
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,040
harder and just like parsing HTML not

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,820
possible with regular expressions so I

32
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,310
have this you probably can't see this

33
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,550
but there's

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,870
pile of wires over there it wasn't my

35
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,970
gray decide you to bring my own audio

36
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,670
setup there's some good helps to get it

37
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,170
all working hopefully and the reason I

38
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,750
said I brought I talked to it by

39
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,660
pressing this button it's a little it's

40
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,090
called a flick you can get them before

41
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,680
pax 2 it's actually pretty cool you hook

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,750
it up to your Android device or other

43
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,030
Bluetooth enabled device we were about

44
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,720
that yesterday and yeah it's literally

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,310
just a button but you can program it to

46
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,980
do stuff and I programmed it to get my

47
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,860
friend to listen so let's see if that

48
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,560
works

49
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,260
hey can you hear us yeah so this already

50
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,320
starting out that that's okay hey can

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:21,590
you hear you might see that I don't know

52
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,580
what you're talking about screen a

53
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,110
little more often I'm gonna explain it a

54
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,090
little more as well cool do you want to

55
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:39,399
tell us your name

56
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:42,599
actually came from me watching too many

57
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,870
movies about hey I might know Samantha

58
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,810
from the movie her and Samaritan from

59
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,540
personal interest the you is actually

60
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,569
inspired by it but besides that this

61
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,640
thing has nothing to do with an AI

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:08,909
companion that us run the world so maybe

63
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:15,989
you can tell us what you do know do you

64
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:24,419
want to tell us what you do maybe you

65
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,680
can quickly go over what this is

66
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:38,880
actually this screen is the texts that

67
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,840
it got let's try one more time can you

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:53,160
tell us what you do so it's an open

69
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,320
source intelligent in quotation marks

70
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,630
couse it is obviously still pretty dumb

71
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,389
a system that you can train and extend

72
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,229
yourself um you might know or use Siri

73
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,460
or Alexa or M which is still in beta

74
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,700
there's many many things like that come

75
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,780
up in the last little while and they're

76
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,820
all kind of still like black boxes and

77
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,430
this thing you can teach your own

78
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,090
language and also extent with plugins

79
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,250
written in html5 and JavaScript it's

80
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,340
pretty cool the whole thing actually is

81
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,539
written in JavaScript and I'm gonna go

82
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:39,630
into the tech in a little bit okay when

83
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,800
you don't know what else to say you just

84
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,710
talk about weather hey what's the

85
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:53,130
weather like dramatic pause so this is

86
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,659
actually an example for a plugin it's

87
00:05:54,659 --> 00:06:00,250
using plain gyah create simple weather

88
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,630
now you can also ask for a city please

89
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,460
don't need a city because yahoo doesn't

90
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,010
allow to ask for anything else anymore

91
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,090
and for I think the next little bit I

92
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,340
might need a volunteer but let me first

93
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,219
show you what you're getting into

94
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:19,020
I brought another mic that you can use

95
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:43,570
and we'll try is it stubborn for you

96
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,330
this is the only evil robot joke in this

97
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,130
talk I'm gonna not do any other ones

98
00:06:52,130 --> 00:07:06,570
cool what's the weather like cool and

99
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,940
maybe the last thing is you can actually

100
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:36,120
look up general things like cool so we

101
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
can do three things if I have a

102
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,760
volunteer that wants to try it out we

103
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,169
can go through the process and see what

104
00:07:43,169 --> 00:08:07,340
happens this is you know this is like so

105
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,690
let's let's see if it works so maybe

106
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:43,219
start with you

107
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,660
see this thing makes me way better jokes

108
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,529
than me all right let's figure out the

109
00:08:50,529 --> 00:09:05,019
weather so the cool thing about this is

110
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:10,660
that you get say hey this is not right

111
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:27,399
I'm gonna teach you a new thing all

112
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,240
right now the most the most interesting

113
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:43,580
part is

114
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,840
so what is the answer to the universe

115
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,380
everything

116
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:56,640
oh let's try what is the answer to life

117
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:16,470
the universe and everything so as you

118
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:38,489
see

119
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:49,519
Thank You max all right this actually

120
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,929
turned out way more entertaining than I

121
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:53,089
thought it would be

122
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:55,339
now before we look on under the hood on

123
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:57,259
what's happening yes let's talk for a

124
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:32,849
couple minutes about the technology so

125
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,679
it's a natural language processing

126
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,809
libraries per node it has like some

127
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:40,220
basic things like

128
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,339
tokenization of a sentence it also has

129
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:49,639
basic classification and that was cool

130
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,489
but the classification runs on

131
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:57,589
statistical analysis and I thought it

132
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,199
would be an interesting exercise because

133
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:01,399
I've been watching too many movies

134
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,379
yeah to hook it up to a neural network

135
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:18,610
yesterday

136
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,980
so you can use that to put sentences in

137
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,830
to train it with certain sentences and

138
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,360
then get label them and get

139
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,620
probabilities back that I put something

140
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,610
else so typical um yeah neural network

141
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,510
machine learning thing now I know this

142
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,400
isn't feathers is another thing I mean

143
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,380
and I know this talk is not about

144
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:51,330
feathers but I can't just and I think it

145
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,500
also covers something that's that's

146
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,990
still kind of important and not done

147
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,750
that often which is how do we make

148
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,080
machine learning data available publicly

149
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,080
right I mean Siri and light box

150
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,390
citizen living room but how do you how

151
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,920
do you make it publicly available and

152
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,840
not just within SDK but actually has an

153
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,930
API so what feathers does it's kind of

154
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,820
like a small library on top of Express

155
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,660
that lets you create and consume rests

156
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,570
and real-time API and that's it so you

157
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,520
can pick whichever that database you

158
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,200
want you can pick whichever front-end

159
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,330
technology one it's just this connector

160
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,950
in between and what this basically does

161
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,640
in this case is gives us a database

162
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,280
connection just to store stuff it's

163
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,220
using any DB because the whole thing

164
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,840
will it's running in a browser right now

165
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,500
but it also can run an electron so that

166
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,140
means that we don't want people to

167
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,580
install MongoDB and stuff like that it's

168
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,030
just a file based database and and then

169
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,560
it also provides the connection because

170
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,900
it also works in the Kline between the

171
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,390
front-end app and the backend and then

172
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,910
we have election react steel which is a

173
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,150
module loaded

174
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,560
throwing stuff dynamically without

175
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,960
having to build it I needed that for the

176
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,520
plug-in system which will hopefully have

177
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,380
some time to look into cool um so

178
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,610
there's two three hmm hey that's my man

179
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,920
someone always changed so there's a

180
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,950
couple things to it the first one and I

181
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,210
don't even think I have to blow that up

182
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,850
because this queen is huge maybe a

183
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,470
little bit

184
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,930
the first one is actions an action is

185
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,610
basically something that you want it to

186
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:49,090
do if you haven't met a sentence try and

187
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,460
pull out something that's similar so in

188
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,010
our case of the two tag goes from

189
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,850
position 4 to 4 which is your

190
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,090
so if somebody says can you hi there my

191
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,120
name is it'll usually try and pull out

192
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,130
the information around that sense this

193
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,760
is actually a pretty dumb algorithm but

194
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,020
it works so well because the

195
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,880
classification of the neural network is

196
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
so accurate that you don't have to worry

197
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,530
about the sentences being so different

198
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,650
so this is how it gets where what's the

199
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,820
weather in Vancouver and things like

200
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,680
that

201
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,160
then we have something here reply with a

202
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,360
couple of things and this is the search

203
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,430
of course this has been done by people

204
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,840
way smarter than me already and there's

205
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,450
an API for it and a really cool one

206
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,120
actually that I hope I have some time to

207
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,670
show a little bit so this is actions

208
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,760
there's only 11 of them and then the

209
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,150
next part of the thing we have is

210
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,130
trainings so you know people always

211
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:05,780
think that millions and millions

212
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,010
well it's somewhat accurate

213
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,990
so this basically maps text to an action

214
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,770
every time we make a new classification

215
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,860
it'll save you when it's not sure it'll

216
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,770
save and Retraining put that one so that

217
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,180
every time master and the action is

218
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:40,070
basically just the action

219
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,529
oh sorry it's all good I'm gonna go back

220
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:46,260
here then I thought this one this one

221
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,130
did work sorry about that

222
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,480
okay so this sounds better so now we

223
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,209
have actions and trainings the last part

224
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:00,779
of the API actually is the interesting

225
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:03,029
one which is the classification and

226
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,400
classification is basically you can just

227
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,339
post to this classify endpoint with your

228
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,309
actual text so if you say can you tell

229
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,110
us the weather in Berlin and they send

230
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,510
this it'll come back with something like

231
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,970
this the texts the tokens tokens are

232
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,850
just each individual word stems are

233
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:27,030
interesting this is basically the base

234
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,710
form of the word so that if you have

235
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,170
singular plural it doesn't matter

236
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,570
or if you have other languages that add

237
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,030
a lot of things at the end of words you

238
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,350
want to know what the actual word is

239
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,950
about so that's pretty useful and by the

240
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,450
way this should ideally also work with

241
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,790
other languages I tried it briefly with

242
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,080
German I unfortunately didn't have

243
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,690
enough time but because it's all based

244
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,750
on word stems and neural networks you

245
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,300
can train it in your own language if it

246
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,710
is possible too

247
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,679
if no natural has a stammer for it so it

248
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,419
can build the bit create the base forms

249
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,150
over work cool this is the action that

250
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,400
it created basically it creates a new

251
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,000
action for us and this is the confidence

252
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,350
so it's actually pretty confident

253
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,580
already because we've done it many times

254
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,730
there's 96 percent confident that this

255
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,610
is what I want and this is the original

256
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,160
action that it got trained with now if

257
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,309
you look back into the browser you'll

258
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:31,260
see that

259
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,309
it's yeah there we go

260
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,840
you'll see that it updated and browsers

261
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:44,840
already now it still has to bend at

262
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,110
humans land on the moon in it's pretty

263
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:54,170
warm in Berlin alright so what happens

264
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,780
in the background is let's make this a

265
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,670
little bigger too because this is where

266
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,230
the action machine learning part happens

267
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,590
you'll see here it gives us a list of

268
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,390
labels to values and those are the

269
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,850
confidences of what action you want to

270
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,860
perform so we'll see here there's a

271
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,630
whole bunch of them that are like less

272
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,410
than one lesson way less than 10% but

273
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,600
this one is 92 percent and this is

274
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,280
exactly the one that we wanted it to do

275
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,610
so that was really cool to see under the

276
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,230
hood and how it gets better the more you

277
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:39,790
train it alright give me back my browser

278
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,380
let's briefly look at how to build a

279
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,600
plugin because I found it really

280
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,030
important to make it almost as easy as

281
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,679
even though jQuery is not used as much

282
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,720
anymore it's still the creating a plugin

283
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,059
for it was the easiest thing you could

284
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:03,460
ever do and I really like that so a

285
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,840
plugin basically has a client and a

286
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,350
server file and on the server in our

287
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,960
case for this one I'm gonna actually

288
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,460
show you first what this plug-in is

289
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,730
about this is the looking up information

290
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,620
on the internet and it's using Wolfram

291
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,770
Alpha which is by the people that also

292
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,790
made Mathematica and it's a knowledge

293
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,880
engine so instead of things like google

294
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,920
it that looks up relevant links for you

295
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,990
it actually tries to get the meaning

296
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,920
from what you ask it so when did people

297
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,050
land

298
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,080
the moon it'll give us way more oops way

299
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,530
more information then what we got back

300
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,200
in the answer but you'll basically get

301
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,570
the same the same things so this is

302
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,850
pretty cool because I didn't have to do

303
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,820
it you just used the API and then

304
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,800
display it on the client so what we did

305
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,080
here was use the node API plug-in create

306
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,740
a new client with the app ID this is

307
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,470
only a test API key if you want to use

308
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,430
it and then it will create a new feather

309
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,590
service it's kind of like a a middleware

310
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,380
except for that it has a crud object

311
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,160
that you pass and in this create so if

312
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,070
you post or call create will create a

313
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,040
query with grab the query from the data

314
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,200
and then just get the result from the

315
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,820
client and return it back so this is

316
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,560
just an API endpoint just like the

317
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,020
classified service that we posted to and

318
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,410
on the client we have the same feathers

319
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,440
app but two additional things one is

320
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,520
learn so when you saw the I don't know

321
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,860
what you're talking about screen you can

322
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,510
basically add things to the drop-down

323
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,670
and say okay now tell me the weather now

324
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,490
do this and now do that you can create

325
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,590
your own forms and submit your own data

326
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,440
in here and then we have the actual

327
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,930
actions so when the action is certain

328
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,910
enough so when so more than 50% sure

329
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,440
it'll just perform the action and what

330
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,750
we do here is pretty much get the text

331
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,030
make a query here to our service that we

332
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,970
created on the server so the cool thing

333
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,770
about this is that it's fine agnostic

334
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,630
now so we could also put it on our

335
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,850
mobile phones or mobile apps or electron

336
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,370
which is what it's going to run in as

337
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,940
the distributable and then we have the

338
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,460
results and just print the main or

339
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,940
primary primary result oh and then so

340
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,520
that's pretty much it and then and then

341
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,570
this is a plug

342
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,130
tear down function so you just clear it

343
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,899
out so you can use whatever technology

344
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:56,509
you want you get all the information

345
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,880
that it got trained with and then you

346
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,889
can perform whichever actions you you

347
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:04,100
would like so that was pretty fun and

348
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,759
and this once I had the whole system in

349
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,460
place was actually really quick to do

350
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,179
and I spent like a whole afternoon

351
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:21,600
asking it random questions all right so

352
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,610
that this whole project started as I

353
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,259
should have to remember to stay here

354
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:31,490
this whole project started as a demo for

355
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,559
the Calgary meetup that I hauled from

356
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,289
the front moved to Vancouver and we

357
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,750
wanted to just show hey here's some

358
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,830
things that you can do with feathers and

359
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,210
let's let's try and use some AI so we

360
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,240
build a collaborative gesture teaching

361
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,730
app which was really cool

362
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,700
it was a clunky but it worked and the

363
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,399
next step was to go into the nest

364
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,500
language processing and I couldn't find

365
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,590
anything related to it except for the no

366
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,070
natural library for for JavaScript and

367
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,919
there's only two personal assistant

368
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,679
projects similar there is serious which

369
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,100
is a research project that tries to do

370
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,039
much more like make sense of photos and

371
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,710
learn from everything not just language

372
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,639
stuff and Jasper I think which is a

373
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:25,990
Python app that's built to run on your

374
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,539
Raspberry Pi or device like that and

375
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:31,610
this one on the other hand I do really

376
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,399
like to have as a desktop app and a web

377
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:39,440
app and it worked really well as a demo

378
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,419
and and then I just continue working on

379
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:48,080
it to continue working on it and three

380
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,539
weeks ago I was hacking away and I was

381
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:53,750
teaching in new things and it recognized

382
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,970
them and when it didn't then I showed it

383
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,539
new things and all of a sudden went and

384
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,860
once it learned a little more it was

385
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,000
really weird cuz

386
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,030
it got less and less sure of things that

387
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,310
had learned before so if I said thank

388
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,890
you it would be like I'm only 20 percent

389
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,200
sure you want me to say you're welcome

390
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,630
and that was really weird because you

391
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,850
know as a programmer we used to for

392
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,620
programming it in once and it'll like

393
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,590
just work forever so I try to figure out

394
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:28,110
what the problem is and I think sorry

395
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,700
it's really helpful sometimes to have a

396
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,590
non programmer sounding board because

397
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,870
then you have to explain it in different

398
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,690
terms and when I did that I said so I

399
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,390
built this thing and it works

400
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,490
but it's super confused with the old

401
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,230
stuff the new stuff it knows really well

402
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,140
but the old stuff it doesn't and we

403
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,880
talked about it was like Dave you

404
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,560
accidentally build Marvin the Paranoid

405
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,310
Android and and and that was really

406
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,780
interesting because the programmer right

407
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,310
you always like okay a program at him

408
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,110
once and it'll work and I get mad if it

409
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,410
doesn't work even with Siri you're like

410
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,750
cursing Apple because they didn't get

411
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,830
what you wanted to do and that was the

412
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,020
case here too the problem was no

413
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,150
positive reinforcement it was I was only

414
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,710
telling it when he was wrong what else

415
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,010
it was supposed to do so that was really

416
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:24,480
interesting for me to learn that you

417
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,370
have to treat it less like programming

418
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,860
and more like teaching a person or

419
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,440
teaching someone which was really cool

420
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,050
for me to see because I think in the

421
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,480
near future we might be you know

422
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,400
teaching our software as much as we

423
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,630
program them and looking at where those

424
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,940
data are stored how they're shared and

425
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,590
where they're coming from is gonna be

426
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,680
come more and more important and just

427
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,660
like we meet better operating systems

428
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,060
with at least making parts of it

429
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,400
open-source I think there should be a

430
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,860
way for training data for machine

431
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,070
learning to be shareable as well there

432
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,780
is not even a shareable format neural

433
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,750
networks work various have a fairly

434
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,460
similar architecture in most programming

435
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,210
languages and there isn't a standardized

436
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,200
format yet to to to exchange it so if I

437
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,950
train it

438
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,740
Google's tensorflow I can't drop it into

439
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,830
brain js2 use it in the browser and I

440
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,059
think that's gonna be going to be pretty

441
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,190
important in the future and I find it

442
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,980
pretty exciting because it's well it's

443
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,409
way more unpredictable but that's how

444
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:33,419
our work is every day anyway

445
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,990
and working with the computer the same

446
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,059
way we work with other people I find

447
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,279
pretty exciting and one thing I want to

448
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,740
work on a little more is turn this into

449
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,279
a fancy generator that just scaffolds

450
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,080
you app by asking you a couple questions

451
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,899
it's a pretty basic step but it will

452
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:54,330
make things a lot easier because you can

453
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,059
actually interact more instead of going

454
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,909
through a command line and yeah if you

455
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:02,279
interest in this as well come chapter me

456
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,830
this is it for me and thanks everybody
