00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:21,400

you

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,529


3
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,480
hi my name is alex i'm a freelance web

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,279
developer here in Berlin and first off

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,839
thanks to the jas comforting for having

6
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,520
me here this is my first really properly

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,559
big audience and it's a great honor to

8
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,780
be here and thanks to all of you for

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,899
your interest in time so a brief

10
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,089
disclaimer before we start I as she just

11
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:43,800
said I work on a Novak in project called

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,500
hoodie hoodie and so this whole topic is

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,540
very close to my heart and the few code

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,070
examples I do have actually come from

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,079
hoodie but there's going to be very

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,199
little code and it's not going to be

17
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,100
self-promotional in any way so don't

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,290
worry about it so what I'm talking about

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,860
is this no back-end idea a new paradigm

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,600
in front and web development which some

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,430
are calling no back end which includes

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,840
the idea of having a back-end as a

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,570
service and essentially what it boils

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,070
down to is that you can build a

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,720
full-featured data-driven web

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
application on the browser side and not

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,790
worry what goes on on the server now I

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,380
don't know about you but to me this

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,950
sounds very desirable I'm primarily a

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,450
front-end developer but in practice of

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,790
course I'm not I'm both end developer as

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,650
probably many of you are because we

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,950
don't really have any choice at some

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,210
point ninety five percent of everything

35
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,040
I build requires some sort of data

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,159
storage or user authentication and so I

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,799
can either just slog through and build a

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,970
back-end I can hire bribe coerce or

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,979
somehow otherwise convince someone to

40
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,750
build it for me or I can just give up

41
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,330
and do something else so if this is a

42
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,430
big commercial thing you're probably not

43
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,299
going to have to worry about this

44
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,560
because somebody else is paying for

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,990
number two but if you just prototyping

46
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,220
an idea or if you're building something

47
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,770
that solves a small personal problem or

48
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,420
for just small products in general

49
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,909
option number two is often out of scope

50
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,610
and option number three is depressing so

51
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,319
you're probably going to try and do it

52
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,360
yourself and then you'll be looking at

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,430
this so I can sit down and I can deal

54
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,110
with all that I mean I can work with

55
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,580
these things but at the same time these

56
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,590
are all jobs other people's jobs

57
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,659
thankfully they make a living with this

58
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:25,890
and they know it really well and while i

59
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,590
can use PHP and rails and find a service

60
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,330
that framework and set up a database and

61
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,669
all that i could probably hack something

62
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,030
together that work

63
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,550
but it wouldn't be very good it would

64
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,680
take me too long and most importantly I

65
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,160
just don't want to it's not my job it's

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,319
not my expertise I probably wouldn't

67
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,600
enjoy it and I would probably find a way

68
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,200
to make terrible security mistakes so

69
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,239
really what do I need I mean in most

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,940
cases my requirements and indeed most

71
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,470
people's requirements at a basic level

72
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,260
are relatively simple what you want is

73
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,569
you want to have users so they can sign

74
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:04,569
in sign out and do user stuff you want

75
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,970
to be able to administer them and send

76
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,170
the new passwords when something goes

77
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,000
wrong you want to let them save and load

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,360
data because otherwise what's the point

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,280
you want to let them share the data with

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,760
each other or with the public maybe send

81
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,890
an email or two and ideally even let

82
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,160
them pay me for it that's not

83
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,019
particularly outlandish people have been

84
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,600
doing this for a very long time it's so

85
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,370
unspectacular I'd actually go and call

86
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,880
it boring it's not exactly particle

87
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,650
physics because this is particle physics

88
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,660
and particle physics is dictated by the

89
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,480
real world the web is not it is dictated

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,110
by what people think how it should work

91
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,209
so this stuff I think it shouldn't be

92
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,549
difficult I think it only should take a

93
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:51,760
couple of minutes so we're used to doing

94
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,650
stuff like this in the Dom you know just

95
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,329
manipulating the element is very query

96
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,230
so why can't signing up a user be

97
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,630
similarly simple why can't we just go

98
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,019
and do that so that's where the note

99
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,420
back end idea comes soon basically makes

100
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,540
that possible it's essentially about

101
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,010
delegation it turns something that is

102
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,320
difficult and full of pitfalls into a

103
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,030
commodity where the tricky and or dull

104
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,560
bits are handled by other people who are

105
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,780
better at it than you are and this makes

106
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,160
sense because we do it all the time in

107
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,370
all aspects of life so I doubt let any

108
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,720
of you do they're distributed version

109
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,020
control by themselves most of us go here

110
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,070
when something goes wrong with our

111
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,510
plumbing we call the plumber and when

112
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,039
something goes wrong with other dirty

113
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,380
things we call a lawyer so why can't we

114
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,650
do this with backends backends are hard

115
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,360
they're made up of a lot of different

116
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,860
components that will have to interact

117
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,240
with each other there's a variety of

118
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,009
languages and

119
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:45,509
in tax and even the simplest set up

120
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:47,669
there are arcane conventions that go

121
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,129
back 30 years and layers and layers of

122
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,740
choose compounded weirdness that really

123
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,180
takes ages to wrap my head around and

124
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,589
that's before you get a single user and

125
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,930
start scaling and really that sounds

126
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,219
like the first thing I want to get rid

127
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:02,999
of and you can get rid of it so by now

128
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,099
there are architectures and services

129
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:07,139
that more or less let you forget about

130
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,169
the backend and let you build these

131
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:11,580
complete data-driven web applications

132
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,610
from the client side all in jas and some

133
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,050
of them have really nifty features like

134
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,449
real-time data binding or offline

135
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:21,180
capabilities so what they do is they

136
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,580
turn your black your back-end into a

137
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,639
black box with an API so no back-end is

138
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,050
really a bit of a misnomer of course

139
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,099
there's a back-end you have to put the

140
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,469
stuff somewhere but it's not something

141
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:32,490
you have to worry about if you don't

142
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:40,800
want to ok so my three lines of code

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,629
examples I just showed you this a minute

144
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:45,899
ago actually I didn't show you exactly

145
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:49,559
that but very nearly that so that's no

146
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,149
back-end code it runs in the front end

147
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:52,589
and it does exactly like what it looks

148
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:55,259
like it does you can do that a few

149
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,059
seconds after you've scaffold about your

150
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:58,620
project in whatever no back in service

151
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,110
is you're using and that's a real thing

152
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,029
that's code from hoodie you can use that

153
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,979
day and it creates a proper user account

154
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,050
it authenticates that user and then you

155
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,009
can start storing data and storing data

156
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:12,809
doesn't look too different I mean

157
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:14,339
there's a store object it has an ADD

158
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,439
method and you give it data and it's

159
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,409
just a type and Jason and you'll notice

160
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,419
that there's no setting up database

161
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,519
there are no schemas there is no config

162
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,110
if you want to store data you store data

163
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,449
go ahead the infrastructure gets out of

164
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,969
your way want to send a multi-part email

165
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,159
from the browser go ahead in 2013 you

166
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,419
can send a multi-part email from the

167
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,800
browser why the hell not so that's a

168
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,749
nice example of the know back in

169
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:41,699
philosophy it's all about the API it's a

170
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,439
front-end centric the actual

171
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,819
implementation of sending that email

172
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,740
might be complicated it might not be

173
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,209
complicated why should we care it's

174
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,439
sending an email it's not that

175
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,449
interesting it should just be a thing

176
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:55,919
that you call and then it works so just

177
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,810
to wrap all that up no back end is

178
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,969
essentially a design paradigm for

179
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,219
architectures and frameworks that

180
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:03,539
abstracts complex back-end operations

181
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,120
and technology into a simple to use rest

182
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,849
api and as i said there is a back-end

183
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:10,319
but you don't have to deal with it if

184
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,659
you don't want to and of course most of

185
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:15,389
these services are extensible so you can

186
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:16,769
add functionality with plugins or

187
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,709
packages so that all sounds pretty good

188
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,389
and I think you get the idea and that's

189
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,409
all the code you're going to see from

190
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,139
you today so what I really want to talk

191
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,699
about is why this is cool and then what

192
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:27,930
I really want to talk about is why it's

193
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,779
important so what's cool is it makes web

194
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,050
development simple and accessible so all

195
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,539
of these things oh sorry for just a

196
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:44,219
second all of these solutions typically

197
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:45,810
typically come either as a service

198
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,669
that's hosted somewhere or as an

199
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,469
installable package that just includes

200
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,439
everything you run it and you get your

201
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,029
server your database you just get all of

202
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,089
it and that's very quick setup it's very

203
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,189
easy and it's a very low barrier to

204
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:01,439
entry in essence you download a thing

205
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,060
you double-click it and you've got a

206
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,469
development environment that's very

207
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:08,129
convenient so ideally and this is for

208
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:09,959
example the case in hoodie where you

209
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,519
used to have a text back with multiple

210
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,559
languages and data formats and maybe

211
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,409
even several databases and query

212
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,269
language and server configurations you

213
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:21,479
now have one language JavaScript all the

214
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,039
way through and you have one day to

215
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,870
format Jason all the way through it

216
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,339
doesn't matter where you access it

217
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,249
everything is JavaScript and Jason

218
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:30,779
that's really nice even the config files

219
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,620
are Jason which is cool and you often

220
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,599
get very simple built-in deployment

221
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,550
mechanisms this go so far that sometimes

222
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,169
it's simply just a button in a web

223
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,719
interface that says deploy and then you

224
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,260
click it and it's deployed and that is

225
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,420
one that's a wonderful user experience

226
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,459
for a developer really so everything's

227
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,260
really really quick to get going and in

228
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,850
general speed is great factor because

229
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,709
there's very little confident

230
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,689
boilerplate you can start doing

231
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:02,519
substantial things almost immediately

232
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,260
there's nothing standing in the way of

233
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,250
your ideas and

234
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,870
testing problems of your app which is

235
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,120
what the user does with your app you can

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,300
just go that's very nice and as I said

237
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,550
most of these solutions have additional

238
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,870
perks like offline mode or live sync

239
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,570
between devices or this nice reactive

240
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,100
use thing which is actually called um

241
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,600
you know the live data binding if

242
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,700
something gets changed in one uses view

243
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,070
all the other connected users get that

244
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,320
immediately and the cool thing is that's

245
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,880
not something you have to invoke in

246
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,400
those cases it's just automatically the

247
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,950
baseline of how these things work so you

248
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,140
save ages not implementing that yourself

249
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,900
so that of course lends itself to rapid

250
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,390
prototyping because you can build these

251
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,040
things and you can turn them out so

252
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,770
quickly that you can just use real data

253
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,630
real behaviors and give your test users

254
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,700
real devices you don't have to muck

255
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,340
about with cards or dummies or something

256
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,410
it's so fast you can actually build real

257
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,710
working prototypes with this well let's

258
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,740
get back to that first point with focus

259
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,690
you start developing in the browser near

260
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,490
the user where the unique aspects of

261
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,170
your app are so you build the user

262
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,910
facing features quickly you validate or

263
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,920
dismiss them you experiment you pivot at

264
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,570
will and you don't have to worry about

265
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,370
the infrastructure setting it up or I

266
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,460
was configured or anything you can just

267
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,020
go and find out whether the idea is

268
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,900
actually worth spending time on without

269
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,890
spending a lot of time on the

270
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,890
infrastructure now back end solutions

271
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,200
bring some interesting aspects in with

272
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,810
regard to flexibility so many of these

273
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,250
let you host let you host wherever you

274
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,520
like as they should but since they're so

275
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,140
easy to install that could also mean you

276
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,210
just have a box that sits in the corner

277
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,400
of your office and there you can have

278
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,589
auto updating self hosted and secure

279
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,270
device independent and deploy software

280
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,190
just running on a box in the corner of

281
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,200
your office and it's just as easy to

282
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,280
install as the development environment

283
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,130
and that's actually becoming a popular

284
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,720
idea right now so here's a nice quote we

285
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,920
spent so much time on the internet that

286
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,630
we should all have a own digital a home

287
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:15,990
on

288
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,760
line so far we're only guessing a couple

289
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,300
of gigantic hotels and he's right and no

290
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,459
back-end can provide a nice vector to

291
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:27,410
get away from that what I can also do is

292
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,080
if we can agree on some sort of

293
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,570
convention backends become swappable

294
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,850
commodities because all you have talked

295
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,830
to is the API and if the api's are the

296
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,930
same across various backends you can

297
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,640
just switch in the will you can use a

298
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,130
local one some something you host

299
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,420
yourself something that's hosted by a

300
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,940
commercial service it's easy to switch

301
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,690
what goes on behind it is important but

302
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,910
no back-end offers some new approaches

303
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,860
to old problems as well in my favorite

304
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,390
one by far is the idea of having one

305
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,260
back-end per user so you as a developer

306
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,560
build your app a static HTML hosted on

307
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,020
github page for example and each user

308
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,540
hosts their own data themselves on

309
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,760
dropbox and google drive with remote

310
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,770
storage or whatever and there's plenty

311
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,540
of application business models that lend

312
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,360
themselves to this type of architecture

313
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,560
namely those where the users don't share

314
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,410
stuff that much and this has a couple of

315
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,000
great advantages sorry first of all

316
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,250
scales really easily because you don't

317
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,100
have the data secondary data privacy is

318
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,540
easier to guarantee because again you

319
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,089
don't have the data and the other cool

320
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,730
thing is multiple apps can access or

321
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,010
could access the same users you data

322
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:46,860
stores so much like something like a

323
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,209
Google Calendar we have to muck about

324
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,820
with caldas and all sorts of things you

325
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,450
could have that in a more easier way

326
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,810
with Anna back end down so each user

327
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,399
could have only one calendar one address

328
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,779
book want to do list but different apps

329
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,480
talk to them and they own the data it's

330
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,300
on their servers but the server's expose

331
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,950
an API to the apps so I think all this

332
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,670
sounds pretty cool I think it

333
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,959
potentially brings a large increase in

334
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,720
simplicity and comfort into the work we

335
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,560
do but for me that's coincidental really

336
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,900
it's not the underlying point the point

337
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,910
where I think this gets valuable is that

338
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,910
I

339
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,190
the internet is unwell and no back-end

340
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,710
could help so let's go back in time for

341
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,290
a second most of you probably know what

342
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,260
this is this is the ARPANET at some

343
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,480
point in the past i think the 80s no

344
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,160
1977 okay the idea of the ARPANET was

345
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,750
connect geographically distributed

346
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,580
computing resources because computing

347
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,190
was expensive and well it just makes

348
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,780
sense to connect them forget about all

349
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,310
the new king stuff but it was important

350
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,290
that the connections be reliable because

351
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,180
the equipment was crap back then it was

352
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,890
all bespoke and kept breaking and the

353
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,300
telephone lines or whatever how they

354
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,640
connected them were also terrible and so

355
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,040
we got packet switching on tcp/ip and we

356
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,110
also got this mental image of the

357
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,780
distributed network now on a technical

358
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,130
level that still accurate of course

359
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,870
that's how the web works more or less in

360
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,510
practice though the individual the

361
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,850
individual nodes are not of equal size

362
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,670
and importance so this is more what the

363
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,280
internet actually looks like in terms of

364
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,890
traffic so the big ones are exactly what

365
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,710
you expect the biggest one is google com

366
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,090
many of the smaller big ones are also

367
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,220
Google and the second big one is

368
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,260
facebook yahoo and apple and stuff like

369
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,430
that so lots of traffic goes through

370
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,010
relatively few relatively large nodes

371
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,340
and this means in the classical sense of

372
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,690
a distributed network that they Apple

373
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,010
significant points of failure

374
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,010
potentially not necessarily in this

375
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,810
reliability sense that they had back in

376
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,870
the 70s in that they'd just stop routing

377
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,130
the packets around and everything would

378
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,780
break but in a more general security

379
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,640
sense so if an antagonistic third party

380
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,140
can access anyone's data in one of those

381
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,600
nodes they must be considered broken and

382
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,980
as we know this is the case so ideally

383
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,140
the web even the social web is properly

384
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,750
distributed to avoid these kinds of

385
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,090
things in the future and our Tim

386
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,190
berners-lee what's it like this he says

387
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,520
we must make what I call social machines

388
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,800
y equals and that I have no idea in

389
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,970
which people can collaborate together

390
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,620
but do so anyway that's decentralized

391
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,930
not based on a central hub and that's so

392
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,520
terribly obvious I feel bad

393
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,660
putting it up there because I think we

394
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,610
can all agree on that but how would it

395
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,390
work so here's an interesting idea this

396
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,370
guy dreams of a future where everybody

397
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,050
has their own server just not the way

398
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,070
you think of it you know a rack

399
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,800
somewhere but it could be your computer

400
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,810
at home a little box next to your TV a

401
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,060
gaming console small server somewhere in

402
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,340
the data center maybe it's not important

403
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,010
it will be like having a mobile phone in

404
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,710
fact it might even be your mobile phone

405
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,660
because it's connected all the time

406
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,000
anyway and you're not going to get that

407
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,670
much traffic on it so your own server

408
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,320
would be so easy to use and easily

409
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,700
integrated with your existing devices

410
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,590
that even your granny would have one so

411
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,680
that's a nice dream but intrinsically no

412
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,000
back-end technology can be really

413
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,300
helpful here because it can help

414
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,550
redistribute apps and user data away

415
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,140
from central nodes and large single

416
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,570
points of failure and it can decrease

417
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,670
the number of data silos which don't

418
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,930
talk to each other and people always

419
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,910
complain about and it can through this

420
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,730
enhanced data security and sovereignty

421
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,770
and what can also do is provide more

422
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,590
infrastructural independence from these

423
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,570
large compromised services with their

424
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,520
own agendas by China back ends into

425
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,250
commodities but it can also do because

426
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,080
of the low barrier to entry is empower

427
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,330
people to build and or run their own

428
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,160
localized tools and solve their own

429
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,250
problems and i also think was really

430
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,660
cool as it brings together the best part

431
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,030
of browser based applications and

432
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,380
locally installed software so

433
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,150
browser-based is cool because it's

434
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,830
browser based you can run it on anything

435
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,839
that can open a browser that's a huge

436
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,820
advantage but you can also have it

437
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,020
running locally and storing your data

438
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,000
locally and not talking to anyone if you

439
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,140
you're concerned about security

440
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,339
implications so that's what pretty neat

441
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,310
but crucial problem is all this

442
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,920
self-hosting the app developing the one

443
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,420
back end per user it has to compete with

444
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,160
the incredibly polished products of

445
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,740
enormous companies so at any given

446
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,390
moment Facebook is looking for at least

447
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,970
three UX people and they already have I

448
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,870
don't know I mean quite a few so these

449
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,640
ideas have to compete on the levels of

450
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,740
functionality user experience design

451
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,390
critical user masses always a big

452
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,340
problem and convene

453
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,140
all of which are perceived is more

454
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,480
important than security which fits in

455
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,500
well with one of the talks we had

456
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,620
earlier security is not perceived easily

457
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,460
or that well so this whole idea is a bit

458
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,620
of a hard sell and we're not going to

459
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,480
get there but continuing to build stuff

460
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,390
by nerds for nerds we've got to make it

461
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,760
easy convincing and enjoyable to move a

462
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,260
personal data away from the big players

463
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,840
it has to be as enticing as leaving my

464
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,280
space so we need great self hosted

465
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,190
applications which we can use to manage

466
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,720
our emails personal pictures and all the

467
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,090
other stuff incidentally he's on next I

468
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,610
didn't even know that until today but

469
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,880
what this means in the end is that we

470
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,430
have to build better tools simpler tools

471
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,960
that make this kind of computing more

472
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,900
accessible and this is our job as j/s

473
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,440
people because the browser is not only a

474
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,990
document viewer anymore it's becoming

475
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,460
the world's most advanced widely

476
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,460
distributed application runtime and

477
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,420
that's actually quite cool because

478
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,680
that's something most people already

479
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,740
familiar with and it's a great chance to

480
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,150
empower people to code and produce

481
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,800
things they can actually use in the

482
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,750
modern world in their world on any

483
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,190
device with the browser just like they

484
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,480
do today so my back-end removes what I

485
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,820
consider a very high barrier of entry so

486
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,110
the white dog is also that's everyone

487
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,580
else so um and that barrier is high

488
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,900
because the simplest form of it you can

489
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:20,760
look at that a bit all to take a drink

490
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,070
do I have to take that down no okay the

491
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,570
simplest form of a web application that

492
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,580
a beginner might be able to deploy at

493
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,500
some point requires you to write HTML

494
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,440
CSS possibly JavaScript PHP and my

495
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,270
sequel that's you know the standard kind

496
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,120
of begin a setup people have so people

497
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,710
like highly paid full-time jobs just

498
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,690
doing the first two and that may not

499
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,030
seem so that to us but to most people

500
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,410
that might as well be actual rocket

501
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,170
science so just getting that set up

502
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,180
remotely and locally and having the to

503
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,040
talk to each other that will deter if

504
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,520
not the feed most beginners and so like

505
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,160
water and electricity humans usually go

506
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,950
the path of least resistance and in many

507
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,730
cases that's Google Docs and so they

508
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,110
just find someone else to solve their

509
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,580
problems instead of trying to solve than

510
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,670
themselves so by supporting these

511
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,190
complexities and reveling in our arcane

512
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,960
skills were helping to turn the web into

513
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,510
old media in a way because while we had

514
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,920
the patience and the will to suffer

515
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,050
through all this adversity of learning

516
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,780
these unknown and difficult things

517
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,190
programming was a new and exciting

518
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,570
mystery at least when I started with it

519
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,760
and the mystery is still is and the web

520
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,860
was uncharted and being created on the

521
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,240
foot and new stuff popped up all the

522
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,760
time and we kind of expected hardships

523
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,260
because everything was new and there was

524
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,330
a new frontier beyond which there was

525
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,630
only science fiction and imagination and

526
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,490
most people around us had no idea than

527
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,200
what we were doing was even possible or

528
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,380
existed in the world and I can

529
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,640
completely understand that at some point

530
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,560
we felt like we earned this power and

531
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,980
they didn't but today computing on the

532
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,690
web are very prevalent in our daily

533
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,940
social lives and the lives of most

534
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,710
people on earth who are somehow

535
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,140
connected but for many of them the web

536
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,990
has always been there many have never

537
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,240
felt that same urge to make because what

538
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,650
they wanted was already there when i

539
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,080
started with computers that's all I got

540
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,790
and that might be the same for many of

541
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,940
you you were practically required to

542
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,520
dive in and to try and to fail and to

543
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,940
try and fail again and again

544
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,380
again and build stuff yourself because

545
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,400
nothing existed and that's not the case

546
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,160
today for most people today the web

547
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,930
isn't the participatory medium it could

548
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,510
be yes they upload terabytes of video a

549
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,740
minute and tens of thousands of

550
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,420
Instagram pictures and years of audio

551
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,330
but that's content they're not making

552
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,190
the web they're using it that's

553
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,750
completely understandable because nobody

554
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,980
is giving the much incentive to do

555
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,950
anything else but that's not the point

556
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,640
of the web is it the web isn't just for

557
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,440
web developers the web is an amazing

558
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,000
system that can do so much for so many

559
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,430
and yet to most people right now it's a

560
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,780
photo scrapbook where you tell the

561
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,860
government where you're with and with

562
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,740
whom so we're letting one of the

563
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,730
greatest feats of human ingenuity

564
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,800
degenerate into a lifestyle magazine

565
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,430
that spies on you and that's sad and I

566
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,470
think one way to remedy this is to put

567
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,140
creative power in of making the way back

568
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,600
into the hands of the individuals which

569
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,480
is the point of the web all along so Tim

570
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,090
berners-lee at the Olympics this is for

571
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,370
everyone and he meant both he meant the

572
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,680
internet ambulant pig's blood yeah and

573
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,180
when he says everyone he means everyone

574
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,730
he doesn't just mean professionals and

575
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,550
corporations everyone and there are

576
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,110
notable precedence for efforts to put

577
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,310
computing power back into the hands of

578
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,030
amateurs so in the 1980s we got hypercar

579
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,220
from Apple which aimed to do exactly

580
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,740
that so the makers of hyper Carter said

581
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,540
they got programming questions from

582
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,490
every kind of person small business

583
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,680
owners school teachers ski bums taxi

584
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,560
drivers and it let non-programmers build

585
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,020
simple apps and so a lot of apps were

586
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,670
created that would not have been created

587
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,410
if apparition was left in the hands of

588
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,710
professional developers because many of

589
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,410
these apps were tailored to do exactly

590
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,850
what the Creator needed at that very

591
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,920
moment and that wouldn't have happened

592
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,830
if some program I had drawn up to spec

593
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,350
based on some marketing research for

594
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,830
example interestingly enough hyper talk

595
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,300
is apparently what inspired Brendan Eich

596
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,520
when writing JavaScript and I can't ask

597
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,190
him any more because he left already but

598
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,840
what's interesting is back then they

599
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,730
were even hardware add-ons for HyperCard

600
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,590
that could exchange signals with the

601
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,090
with external devices much like the

602
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,340
Arduino or the tehsil which just got

603
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,309
funded this month and that was ages ago

604
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:37,830
what happened I mean even before that

605
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,289
there was small talk 70s which was

606
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:42,240
similarly appealing to a wide range of

607
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,770
people but that back then nobody had the

608
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,770
hardware but the software existed and

609
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,190
that doesn't look too bad a man it looks

610
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,750
a tiny bit like coffeescript with his

611
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,220
Pleasant lack of curly braces and

612
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,169
semicolons and everything but the

613
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:56,820
coolest things it was easy to learn and

614
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,940
that thing was an integrated editor

615
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,190
debugger execution view thing so you ran

616
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,159
that and that was it you could go very

617
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,700
low barrier of entry so small token

618
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,960
HyperCard were interesting because they

619
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,640
made programming accessible and people

620
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,500
from all walks of life could actually

621
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,360
take advantage of these new powers of

622
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,640
technology that were turning up

623
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,590
everywhere except back then nobody had

624
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,140
the hardware but what's the equivalent

625
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,409
of that today I think its front end web

626
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:27,840
technology and JavaScript you can write

627
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,909
run debug and use your code in one place

628
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:32,159
in the browser you can modify the code

629
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,899
while it's running its platform

630
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:36,059
independent it's networked you can

631
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,309
distribute it via the web and anyone who

632
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:40,140
can find it can probably run it as well

633
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,049
and you can even fly drones and control

634
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,610
other hardware with it that's no limit

635
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,409
to what you can do with it by now that's

636
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:49,980
a very powerful tool so what should be

637
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,539
doing is making powerful tools

638
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,070
accessible and easy to set up and

639
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,600
quickly get started and delivered with

640
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,059
encouragement and enthusiasm instead of

641
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,179
kept to ourselves with monkish elitism

642
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:03,330
so Lenox program should be learned you

643
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,190
like be about play it should be about

644
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,500
getting things running quickly and just

645
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,120
seeing what happens and poking stuff I'm

646
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,190
not setting up servers and stuff like

647
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,320
that and i think--not back in technology

648
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,020
can be extremely helpful in this regard

649
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,580
so helpful in fact that one of hoodies

650
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,190
design goals is to make its use

651
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,840
attractive and intuitive to begin as a

652
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
non professionals and we came up with a

653
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,649
process to help us achieve this and we

654
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,710
call it dream code and that slide

655
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,940
doesn't do it justice so there's a

656
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,779
second slide

657
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:38,250
so when we designed the initial API for

658
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,740
our no back-end thing we each sat down

659
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,289
and wrote hypothetical apps that worked

660
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:44,970
with a fictional know back in the API

661
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,549
that didn't exist yet and which

662
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,620
reflected what we thought were the most

663
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,929
intuitive simple and sensible ways of

664
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:54,299
working so we didn't start with the

665
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,370
system's capabilities and then exposed

666
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,259
them to the user we started with the

667
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,730
users requirements and built backwards

668
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,440
from there because we wanted people to

669
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,659
have a good experience with it so

670
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,610
essentially dream code is user centered

671
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,820
design for API it and for this was

672
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,049
really crucial because our target

673
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:11,700
audience for Juan Pardo isn't developers

674
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,730
like us we are also aiming for the non

675
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,409
developers the non-professionals the

676
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,029
beginners the amateurs those who can

677
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:20,669
just barely get along with jquery that's

678
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:22,259
cool we just want to give them more

679
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:25,200
power so we've made data-driven app

680
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,759
development so much simpler and more

681
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,679
convenient it would be a huge waste not

682
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,480
to try and broaden the scope of the

683
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,059
audience that where you're dressing we

684
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,320
want the power simplicity and

685
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,759
accessibility of small talk and

686
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,600
hypercard in the web realm but what this

687
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,970
ends up meaning is that where we are

688
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,830
designers like we and developers we are

689
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,110
designers not in the way you think I

690
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,419
mean this I mean this differently so we

691
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:49,649
need to know the fundamentals of design

692
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,629
process and design thinking but not

693
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:54,090
because we need nice websites for our

694
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,730
projects or nicely typeset document

695
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,190
documentation pages but because using

696
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,649
what we build from finding it to

697
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:03,090
learning about it to getting it running

698
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,190
to working with it to failing with it to

699
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,139
ask them for help with it succeeding

700
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,620
with it all of that is user experience

701
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,169
we are experienced designers we shape

702
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:15,360
how people experience what we make and

703
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,549
it pays off to design towards that

704
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:18,929
experience because that's what Google

705
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,879
and Apple and Facebook do and what

706
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:23,279
developers left of themselves tend to

707
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,039
forget and I know this from myself as

708
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,440
well so how many brilliant engineering

709
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,789
projects are there on the web that go

710
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:31,169
under use and ignore because the

711
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:32,519
engineer at some point thought when I

712
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,690
didn't have a three-point getting

713
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,250
started guide why should anybody else I

714
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,049
suffered for this knowledge and so

715
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:39,120
should you and that's not a good

716
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,940
attitude because we're experienced

717
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,570
designers whether we like it or not as

718
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,769
programmers what we produce needs to be

719
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,360
designed to the users needs and how you

720
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,950
present it needs to be tailored to an

721
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,990
intended audience and that audience is

722
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,909
far too often the one person who wrote

723
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:57,240
the damn thing it needs to offer a good

724
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,590
user experience even if it's just a

725
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,179
snippet of code on a gist somewhere

726
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,639
people are going to use it and that's

727
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,139
just a matter of economy too because

728
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:06,029
every time a developer saves time by

729
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:07,950
leaving in something dodgy or obtuse or

730
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,799
not immediately obvious that time gets

731
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,169
wasted dozens of hundreds of times over

732
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:14,549
by the people have to try and figure it

733
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:18,090
out first and short make it easier in

734
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,889
even shorter don't believe in

735
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:22,950
trickle-down technology and technology

736
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,629
some of us share a similar philosophy to

737
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:26,059
trickle down economics which says that

738
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:29,369
if we help the people at the top somehow

739
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:30,869
everything will just trickle down and

740
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:33,869
people who aren't as savvy as we are

741
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:36,600
will somehow benefit from it but just

742
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,369
like trickle-down economics that doesn't

743
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:43,529
work so we we can revel in this idea of

744
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,940
the open web and it's all well and good

745
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,710
but at the moment that open web is like

746
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,240
an open window in the second story and

747
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,100
you have to bring your own ladder it's

748
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,220
not for everyone and I think no backing

749
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,840
is a great opportunity to help more

750
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,169
people shape the web and you you don't

751
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,250
have to worry about your job in your

752
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,230
status I mean these technologies are not

753
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,809
complete replacements for any tech stack

754
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,610
or it's not a magical solution that will

755
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,779
make your engineering department

756
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,320
disappear overnight it's just another

757
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,809
solution that aims to be more open and

758
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:15,090
brings a number of promising promising

759
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,250
benefits that are good for the web good

760
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,940
for us and in the end good for everyone

761
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,500
so to recap what is no back-end

762
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,139
technology that brings speed simplicity

763
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,029
and flexibility to web app development

764
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:29,940
not just for us but to everyone it

765
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,690
liberates and empowers by simplifying

766
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,980
development at lowering the barriers of

767
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,680
entry massively it's tech the chemistry

768
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,890
applications and kill data silos it's

769
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,200
tech that can make the web the platform

770
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,700
for entry-level general-purpose

771
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,860
computing and learning about code by

772
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,750
making getting started with the whole

773
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,480
thing much easier and in the end it's

774
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,010
also checked that requires us to think

775
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,660
more like product managers and designers

776
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,310
so we can build good experiences for

777
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,900
other humans which is the whole point

778
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,990
and all of these things are good things

779
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,390
it's our job to make making the web more

780
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,610
accessible to more people that is our

781
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,890
power and nobody else is going to do

782
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,230
this i think if we can help people

783
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,210
understand the web they can make the web

784
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,830
and if they make the web they will care

785
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,990
about it more and the more people care

786
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,030
about understand and make the web the

787
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,110
better we'll all be better off it'll be

788
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:34,259
thanks
